But when the fleshlusts against the spirit
and the spirit against the flesh,
the rational soul is supportedby the cross of Christ.
Nor does it, when seducedby evil desires,
consent to evil doings,
for it is piercedby the nails of continence
and the fear of God.
And, as at all times,we must live worthily,
so at all times we must bear the cross,
which for each oneis rightly called his,
for it is born by each one...
Im not feeling so good.
Thats because youre hung over.
I can smell it.
We have supper.
Shes been fasting all day.I need your help.
And as a rule,
there is a greater dangerin the hidden betrayer
than in the open foe.
Is there a draft? Ill close it.
No, Father.
Are you with one of these two?
No.
Okay, turn around.
If you see me againand Im not smiling,
I dont think youre gonna like it.
Now get back in there.
Are you leaving?
Just to get some air.
You dont have to be polite.
Im sorry. I didnt wantto lie to you in here.
Im Father Gill.
Im Peggy Olson.
- Katherine Olsons girl.- Yes.
Yes, Im having dinner at your sisters.
Are you a new priest?
Im visiting.
So are you gonna come back in?
Yes.
Hello.

Good.
Bye-bye.
Whats with you?
I dont know.
I had an amazing dream.
Youre always hogging the TV!
I dont like baby stuff.
Get out. Were... sleeping.
Get some Raisin Bran.
You can eat it in the den.
Out!
Out!
I should have locked the door.
Heres number 2, sir.
Thank you, Jeeves.
Why are we in the living room?
Because we live here.
What did I say about the stereo?
I wasnt touching it.
Bobby, I saw you do it.
- I didnt do it.- Go watch TV, both of you.
I love this song.
His voice is like silk,
and you can really hear the words.
He makes everythingsound like Christmas.
In high school, I used tolove dancing to this song.
Come dance with me.
I thought we werentdoing anything today.
Hurry. Its almost over.
I hate to think about yourreputation in high school.
Are you going to sit at the table?
Gerry, could you get it?
Jesus, Anita, I cant move.
Watch your language!
And I dont care if you have to lay there.
- Put your shoes on!- Little Gerry, get my shoes!
Do you want me to get the door?
I cant reach my toes.What am I supposed to do?
Hello, Father.
Youre not leaving, are you?
Hello, Father. Im sorry Im late.
I went by Green-Wood to visit my son.
Well, I would love to meet him.
Its a cemetery.
Father, welcome.
Come, before it gets cold.
Hello, Father.
Im sorry I missed Mass. My back is out.
He hasnt been feeling well,but he did his part.
He watched the baby.
Well, I hope you feel better soon.
We all do.
Im sorry. I gotta lay down.
Oh, please, please.
Oh, come.
Of course, Father.
Right this way.
We have you here.
Gerard! Mikey! Wash your hands!
Theyve disappeared.
Dont wait for them.
Father, would youhonor us and say grace?
Certainly. Why not?
O Lord, thank youfor this wonderful feast.
Thank you for these people
and this parish and their home.
That was beautiful.
Are you gonna say grace now?
Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts
we are about to receive from thy bounty,
and make us ever mindfulof the needs of others.
Through Christ our Lord.
Amen.
Okay.
Monsignor says you havea beautiful singing voice.
And you play the harmonica?
The guitar.
I actually learnedhow to play the mandolin
when I was in Rome.
And soccer.
Did you meet the Holy Father?
Not exactly.
Its kind of like being in Washington
and asking if youve met the president.
But you knowwhen hes in the building.
Arent you gonna have one?
Should I?
Well, Im not gonna drink by myself.
Ill get the sherry.
Ill get it, Ma.
Ive always wanted to go to Rome.
Ah, yes, well,Vatican City is one thing,
but then you realize youre in Italy.
Peggy works in Manhattan.
Oh, really?
What do you do, Peggy?
She works on Madison Avenue.
She comes up with the wordsin advertisements.
They call it copywriting, Ma.
Father, Im glad youre here.
I didnt know they knew what I did.
Stop it. No, you should see her work.
Lipstick, reducing programs,feminine products.
Mom, not in front of Father.
She used to do her presentations for us.
She uses Latin.
Im sorry to do this,but I really should go.
Look at that.
Well, where are you headed?
Ill give you a lift. I have a car.
- To the Fourth Avenue BMT.- Okay.
It is such an honorto have you in our house.
And Im sorry the chickenwas overcooked.
The chicken was perfect,and you know that.
Go get the Brownie.
Let me wrap up some cake.
Thank you, but no, thank you, Anita.
Youve all really made me homesick.
Father, would you mind?
Say "cheese."
- Cheese.- Cheese.
Brooks, have you made any decisionabout our immediate future?
Believe it or not, Daddy,
Brooks has other interestsbesides drinking.
Thatll change.
Would you stop scaring them?
Were not scared.
Then how is it youve been engagedfor two months
and youre not running aroundmaking wedding plans?
Because I told you.
We dont like the ideaof having a big wedding.
It doesnt have to be big.
We think its silly.
You have to invite a bunch of strangersto gawk at us
to somehow proveour feelings for each other.
You know, its embarrassing.
Brooks?
Whatever she wants.
Well, your mother wants a wedding.
Mommy had a wedding.
I did.
Wearing that dress,
my sister and my motherfussing over me.
It was the best I ever looked in my life.
The Pierre.
I was drunk, and I didnthave a glass of champagne.
Gliding around in your fathers arms.
You know how good a dancer he is.
Dancing with Grandpa.
I dont want you to miss that.
What are you getting?
Ill have the musselswith garlic if you do.
Thats sweet.
Thank you for the ride, Father.
Peggy, wait.
Yes?
I want to ask you about something,and its personal.
Okay.
I have the honor of deliveringthe sermon next Sunday.
Its Palm Sunday. Thats a biggie.
I mean, youre on deck for Easter.
And, well...
you said you did presentations.
Can I run some things past you?
I dont know what I could tell you.
You must do this all the time.
Well, Ive done it,
but your monsignoris a tough act to follow.
I dont know that Im your audience.
You were leaving,
and we ended uphaving supper together,
and youre the onlyperson in this parish
that knows about public speaking.
This is how God works.
I find that if Im prepared
and I have confidencein what Im selling,
that k*ll the butterflies.
Thats good.
Im prepared.
Do you have any other tips?
Well, pick somebodyand make eye contact with them.
Youd think it would make you nervous,but it really focuses you.
Dont they have stuff thatyoure supposed to talk about?
Yes, they have stuff.
Lets just say Im coveredin the content department.
I can only speak for myself,
but the sermon is the only part of Massthats in English,
and its very hard to tell sometimes.
Maybe be simpler?
Give us a chance of understanding.
Thank you for the ride.
I should go. I really do have to work.
Idle hands.
Its good to know you.
Have a great week.
I hate my feet.
I love your feet, Mommy.
Feet? I thought those were water skis.
Stop it.
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Great.
You broke it.
I didnt mean to.
Youre being wild in the house.
Its late.
Everybody, brush your teethand go to bed.
Im hungry.
Youre going to bed.
We didnt have any dinner.
Its 7:30.
Okay. Come downstairs.
Ill make you some grilled cheese.
Go.
- Go. Go. Go.- Come on.
And my wife says, "Duck and cover."
Well, look at this.
Marty, meet Vicky.
Hello, Marty.
- Hello.- Ive heard so much about you.
But you didnt tell meabout his wonderful head.
What about it?
Someone thinks a lot.
Well, look at that. Its love at first rub.
My head has been knownto make wishes come true.
Dont get up.
This is Marty Hasselbach,from Gortons.
Nice to meet you. Roger Sterling.
We were due to meettomorrow anyway.
- Love that frozen scrod.- Thank you.
Im Vicky, Martys wife.
Arent you a lucky man.
Yes, I am.
We were just discussing the male head.
Is that right?
I like the Yul Brynner look.
She does seem to.
I keep threateningto shave him one morning.
Just hop in the showerand take it all off.
Is that right?
How long have you two been married?
Five years.
Second time around. That explains it.
Its nice to meet you.
I hope to see you both tomorrow.
A pleasure.
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrettis here at my desk.
No. Of course. Send her in.
Mrs. Barrett.To what do I owe the pleasure?
May I take your coat?
No, thank you.
Im not sure how theydo it in show business,
but around herewe have this nifty gadget
called an appointment book.
I was in the neighborhood.
What did Jimmy do now,ask Eleanor Roosevelt
how fast her husbandran the hundred-yard dash?
How are you?
Busy.
I have an idea for a television show.
Congratulations.
Is it too early to have a drink?
Let me call for some ice.
No need.
How do I make this happen?Where do I go?
What is it?
Everyone loves Candid Camera, right?
Hidden camera situations.
Only Jimmys the host,
and hes Jimmy, you know?
Not nice.
Its derivative, with a twist.
Thats what theyre looking for.
Its called Grin and Barrett.
Thats cute.
I thought it up all by myself.
ABCs sick about losing Candid Camera.
But youd have to get Jimmyout of his contract with Utz.
I thought about that.
Its exclusive,
but they could come on as sponsors.
Show needs a national sponsor.
Utz wont do you any good.
Youre a pessimist.
They could let him out.
They should want to keep Jimmy happy.
They dont care.
But they could be told
that their spotswould have more punch,
wherever they air,
if Jimmys on a hit television show.
That is very good advice.
Will you sell the show for me?
Im not interested in doing that.
But I can talk to the Schillings.
Whats this?
I was thinking how I could avoidbecoming bored with you.
Bobbie. I have work.
Bullshit.
Its good.
But we should sell themon the mascot first.
The jingles going to be a cutie.
Hasselbachs at 3, right?
Is he bringing the missus?
Mary, thatll be all for now.
Roger...
there is a Mrs. Hasselbach,
and thats not her.
I see.
That makes sense.
Ive got her number if you want it.
Ive got lots of numbers.
No. Thats okay.
Keep up the good work.
Daddy!
You need to shave.
You need to shave.
Some people werent so good today.
What happened?
Bobby broke the record player.
The repair call is going to be $18.
9 if you want to put it in your carand drag it over there.
I dont.
When I asked him about it,
he said he didnt do it.
He lied to my face.
Where is he?
In his room.
Go on out.
Mommy says you broke the hi-fi.
I believe her.
Dont do that again.
I wont.
Thats it?
I said to him,"Wait till your father gets home,"
and thats what he gets..."Go to sleep."
He knows he did something wrong.
First the shenaniganswith the washing machine,
and now the record player.
Don, you have to do something.
He needs a spanking.
How else is he gonna learn
the difference betweenright and wrong?
Thats not the way it works.
You think youd bethe man you are today
if your father didnt hit you?
Can I get something to eat?
You left this by the bed.
Ill do it.
Draper residence.
Good. Youre there. Its Duck.
Sunday morning.Where else would I be?
Shel Keneally called me late last night.
American Airlines already scheduled
a bunch of pitches for this week.
Why are we on the calendarfor two weeks from now?
Were not anymore.
I got us Good Friday first thing.
Most of the teams already here.
The rest are on their way.
My hand!
Hello?
Let me look.
It hurts.
I walk out of the roomfor ten seconds?
Mommy, make it stop.
He needs to goto the emergency room.
That was Duck Phillips on the phone.
American Airlinesmoved up their presentation.
- So?- So I have to go in.
Damn it.
One child in the emergency roomis enough to deal with.
Take Sally.
Send Sally to Francines.
Its Palm Sunday.
I am not about to imposeon Francine today.
I want to go with Daddy.
Hello, Father Gill.
Come in.
- Come in.- Father, welcome.
Im terribly sorry, Anita, Ms. Olson.
I cant stay.
- Oh, no.- Oh, thats terrible.
We have Tom, Roberta Callahan,
Mrs. ONeill, Mrs. Casey.
Yes, Im afraid Mrs. Marchettihas taken a turn for the worse.
I hope youll forgive me.
Oh, that poor woman.
Let me fix you a paper plate.
Peggy didnt make it?
Oh, shes sick.
Oh. Well, could you give her this?
It is a copy of my sermon.
She helped me quite a bit,
and I would love for her to see it.
Peggy helped you write something?
Just some tips, really.
It was very good.
I felt like I was the only oneyou were talking to.
Well, thank you.
Again, Im sorry.
Its so nice hes taken an interest in her.
Come, lets eat.
Mr. Phillips and the othersare in the conference room.
I see youve brought a little helper.
Betty had her hands full today.
Sally, be good for Miss Holloway.
Keep her away from the paper cutter.
Friday morning,the American Airlines folks
will join us at 10.
Roger will handle the introductions.
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Sterling,
Creative to the right,Accounts to the left,
starting with myself, then the AmericanAirlines people, then Campbell.
Pete, youre next to our man Shel Keneally.
There will be one for each of them.
We cant get cordovan by Friday,so were going with maroon.
Campbell will run the show.
He has a list of every adwe need in the presentation.
Art Department needs to make sure
that every image we use in a compis an airplane that American has.
No cutting and pastingplanes from other ads.
They may all look alike to us, but...
Why are you here?
Im head of the Television Department.
We have 90 minutes to present.
Ill do the setup...
the history of American Airlines
up to and including the crash.
Ill tee up Creativewith what research says
travelers are waitingto hear from American.
And then, Don, you do what you do.
Maybe you could give us a little peek.
Im not ready to do that yet.
I say we show all three campaigns,
eliminate all possible objections.
Something for everybody.
Remember, this isnt the workwe have to run in the end.
This is about winning these guys over.
Creative.
In my office.
You have big ones.
My mommy has big ones, too.
And Im gonna havebig ones when I grow up.
I dont care if werejust selling a point of view,
but we have to commit to one thing.
They dont like wiggle room.
They like to see usblowing up bridges behind us.
These are the boardsfor the 60-second television spots.
Music you can talk over.
Stewardesses.


Were gonna bookend every spot
with the plane taking off and landing
up, down, no problems,
everything okay, every commercial.
Wheres that listDucks buddy Shel gave us
with all the things thatmake American different?
Whats that?
The ad you asked forto recruit stewardesses.
It equates what shouldbe a glamorous job
with being a waitress in a tin can.
Wheres the bar of soap,the ticket sleeves?
Whos doing the in-flight menu?
I think its the best menu Ive ever written.
This is in French.How do I know its right?
Its right.
Make up a chef.
Peggy, did you pick outa china pattern yet?
Did you find the onefrom the Queen Mary?
Yes. But there needs to be a decisionif were doing anything to the logo.
I dont know.
We got a lot of bricks,
but I dont knowwhat the building looks like.
So how are you, Vicky?
Im in a very good mood.
Well, I hate to sound remedial,
but I havent done thissince I was in the Navy.
Been with a girl?
No. Not that.
Dont worry.
The prices may have changed,but the menus still the same.
Well, your invoice ran across my desk.
Look at you.
The menu hasnt changed.
Is it open for negotiation?
I dont want to ruin the magic.
How about double... plus carfare?
And Ill assume you live far away.
Thatll be $100.
But I want everything I want.
Isnt that the perfect thing to say?
Thats not so bad, is it?
I have to warn you,Im not in great health.
Dont believe what they say.
No one dies doing this.
Are you resting?
Everybodys resting.
No. Im thinking.
Lets have a conversation.
Is that your maid?
No. Shes my girlfriend.
Do you kiss her?
Sometimes.
Do you lay on top of her?
You know what, Sally?
Your daddys gonna be angryif I dont do my work.
Okay.
Just a minute, girls.Its almost your turn.
You know, well get to goanywhere American flies.
Familiarization.
Well have to rent another floor.
Well all have our own offices.
Do you realize we will get to pick outthe stewardesses?
Okay.
Son of a bitch.
Stupid little...
You there.
Chewing your cud.
Its one thing to be unladylike.
Its another to treat our officelike a subway platform.
Pack up your Wrigleys and go home.
How could it be my gum?My gums in my mouth.
This place is a zoo.
Thank you for getting himout of here for the day.
Lose the gum, then getyourself some dinner.
He wont remember firing you.
American Airlines is not about the pastany more than America is.
Ask not about Cuba.Ask not about the b*mb.
Were going to the moon.
Throw everything out.
Everything?
There is no such thingas American history,
only a frontier.
That crash happenedto somebody else.
Its not about apologiesfor what happened.
Its about those seven menin the room on Friday
and what airline they aregoing to be running.
So what does that mean?
Lets pretend we knowwhat 1963 looks like.
Jesus, Draper, make a decision.
Whats that leave us with,introductions?
If I cant mention the crash,
theres no preamble at all.
Let it go.
Our job is to bend down the branch.
Let him pick the fruit.
That champagneis probably near frozen.
Im meeting a friend.
You know what I really want?
Is there something we left out?
Have dinner with me?
I told you Im meeting a friend.
Ill pay for his meeting, too.
You wouldnt think dinnerwould be pushing it on the extras?
Have you been to Lut?ce yet?
I have.
I think youd like it.
Ive got it.
Its great, but theyre cheeky.
They started with thisprix fixe menu at lunch.
8.50 for lunch.
And they have these wines.
What kind of wine do you like?
I dont know. Red?
Theyre going to make you bemore specific than that.
We can walk, if you dontmind a little rain.
You know what?
I love the sound of cabswhooshing in the water.
Shall we?
Isnt this a nice town?
Absolutely.
Shes here on a Sunday,and I respect that,
but you know shes earningmore than all of us.
Come on.
Up.
Good night, ladies.
Thanks for baby-sitting.
Im going home. Be good, Peaches.
Your sister wants to talk.
Hey, Pegs.
Okay.
It was good.
He gave us a copyof his sermon to give to you.
Okay. So long.
Its nice that he can get to know herwithout all her troubles.
Shes such a beautiful young girl.
She does whatever she feels likewith no regard at all.
Youre too easy on her.You know that.
Is Gerry warming up the car?
Shel Keneally was fired this morning.
What?
The rest are on their way in.
Whats going on?
Its over.
So why are they coming in?
Because they have to.
And we have to deliver a stillborn baby.
Mr. Phillips, the gentlemen are herefrom American Airlines.
Send them in.
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, amen.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Its been two weekssince my last confession.
I took somethingthat didnt belong to me.
Go on.
I was in the Laundromat,
and I took some coins off the machine
and used them.
I took the Lords namein vain three times,
and...
and I am so angry, Father.
I am so angry at my little sister.
Shes causing my mother so much pain.
She had a child out of wedlock.
She seduced a married man.
Its a terrible sin,
and she acts like it didnt even happen.
And I hate her for it.
And I feel so guilty about it.
But everyone keepsfalling all over themselves
trying to help her.
And she goes onlike nothing happened.
Nothing at all.
What about me, Father?
My troubles?
What about me being good?
For what?
I understand its difficult.
You know its not your place to judge.
God sees your goodness.
It doesnt feel that way, Father.
Try to trust God on this.
You will get your reward in heaven.
God loves you,
and he knows that you love your sister.
I do.
Say three Hail Marysand two Our Fathers.
And try to forgive your sister.
Shes not as strong as you are.
Would you like to makeyour Act of Contrition?
O my God,
I am heartily sorryfor having offended thee.
I detest all my sins
because I dread the loss of heaven...
Cooper walked them to the elevator.
They acted impressed.
I just cant believe it.
Here. You should have this.
No regrets, fellas.
We were in it.Thats the important thing.
Its heartbreaking.
Still, good work, Don.
Come on.
We hired him to bring in new business,
not lose old business.
Dont you love the chase?
Sometimes it doesnt work out.
Those are the stakes.
But when it does work out...
its like having that first cigarette.
Head gets all dizzy.
Your heart pounds, knees go weak.
Remember that?
Old business is just old business.
Youre home early.
Its Good Friday.
How did it go?
It didnt.
Bobby, stop playing with the robot.
Do you want to talk about it?
No.
How was your day?
My father called. Hes doing better.
He and William played golf yesterday.
William made a show of paying for it.
Bobby, what did I just say?
It was a accident.
You dont listen. Don, do something.
Is that what you wanted?
You take no responsibilityfor anything that goes on in this house.
I pay the bills,put clothes on your back,
your damn stables.
Dont you dare.
Im here all day.
Alone with them, outnumbered.
What about Carla?Doesnt she count?
Its not her job to raise our children!
Im here, and then you come homeand get to be the hero.
You want me to bring home
what I got at the office today?
Ill put you through that window.
Brush your teeth. Its bedtime.
Bobby, its not a good time.
Im sorry.
Its okay.
Dads get mad sometimes.
Did your daddy get mad?
He did.
What did your daddy look like?
Like me.
But bigger.
What did he like to eat?
Ham.
And this candy.
It tasted like violets.
Had a beautiful purpleand silver package.
What did he do?
I told you. He was a farmer.
But he died.
A long time ago.
We have to get you a new daddy.
Come here.
You have nothing to say?
What do you want to hear?
Something.
Anything.
How about youre goingto help raise these children,
not be one?
Bets,
you do whatever you want.
Its not about what I do.
Hes a little kid.
My father b*atthe hell out of me.
All it did wasmake me fantasize
about the dayI could m*rder him.
I didnt know that.
And I wasnt halfas good as Bobby.
Happy Easter, Peggy.
Hello, Father.
I read your sermon. I liked it.
It was very colloquial.
You were very helpful.
These kids.
For the little one.
