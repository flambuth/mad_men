Its smooth, its brown.
Now, Sinatra drinks it.Why shouldnt you?
This bulging?
No.
Can you get somebody to clean upthe loose chips on the bar?
Its messy. And if I decideI want to spill some during the bit,
its not going to be funnyif theres already some there.
Going again.
Rolling. Sound, speed.
"Utz Are Better Than Nuts"bar scene, take 6.
Action.
Imagine my horror whena night on the town turned ugly.
This is a nice place for nice people,
and the jerk behind the bar,he throws a bowl of nuts at me.
What am I, a squirrel?
Well, lucky for him,I bring my own wherever I go.
Am I crazy? I dont think so.
Just you try and stick your faceinto a can of nuts.
Take it from a nut.
Utz are better than nuts.
Dont cut. No. I want to do that again.
Roll the camera over that way 5 feetand come in around the lapels.
Quiet, please.
Still rolling.
Just try sticking your faceinto a can of nuts.
Here we are in Lakehurst, New Jersey,
watching as the great airship Hindenburg
attempts to tie off its mooring mast and...
Oh, my God!She suddenly burst into flames!
Oh, God! Look at the size of it!
Its horrible! Oh, the humanity!
Hey, get Sitting Bull on the phone.
We found the last buffalo.
Hey, get a wider lens, right?
We want to sh**t her in CinemaFat.
Hey, Jimmy, what do you saywe take a little break?
Open your mouth, sweetheart.
I want to see if Gepettosbuilding a fire in there.
That man is an animal.
Jesus, Jimmy.
Just for your information,this guys laughing over here.
Are you going right home?
No.
I have marketing.
I have to pick up Dons watch.
- You bought Don a watch?- I got it repaired.
He was bathing the kids with it.
Ive been looking for one for Raymond.
- Were coming up on 10, you know.- 10?
Poor man has to think of somethingfor the girl who has everything.
Did you make any suggestions?
I do love your car.
Thats not romantic.
Did you hear the partwhere I said 10 years?
I shouldnt be saying that.
He looks like a little boy.
I guess.
He reminds me of Monty Cliftin A Place in the Sun,
learning how to ride so he canworm his way into the upper crust.
Somewhere theres a pregnant girlfloating in a lake.
Im from the South.There are such people.
I think he needs a different horse.
Hes on the worst one we have.
I apologize.
I knew it would be a challenge,or I would have done it myself.
Thank you, Gertie.
You have to admit... he is handsome.
Hes got that going for him.
Shall we?
I have to get my purse.
No. Youre not going anywhere.
We have to meet her.
Mrs. Draper, Mrs. Carson,
this is Tara Montague, my fianc?e.
Sarah Beth Carson.
Betty Draper.
You must be the ladies he rides with.
Were among them.
Artie, are you the rooster around here?
I think they make fun of me.
We dont. That would be cruel.
Well, Ive done plenty of things for him.
And Id love to continue doing so.
Pleased to meet you.
Shes pretty.
Very pretty.
Prettier than I expected.
I think shes about right.
I spend too much time here.
I actually dreamt about him.
I think it was him,
or a version of him that could ride.
Ill see you Saturday.
No. Youll have him to yourself on Saturday.
Becky has a dance recital.
Its so horrible to putgirls that fat in a leotard.
Stop. Shell outgrow it.
She did.
Happy Thursday, Mr. Crane.
Thank you.
Youve never openedone of these, have you?
Hey, Todd.
Yes, Mr. Crane?
Nothing. Get the door, will you?
Damn it.
Whoa.
You in the middle of something?
Were going to the Oyster Bar.
Yeah. Im not hungry.
Hello.
Good. You are home.
Never got any better.
I almost threw up waiting for our elevator
and then just came backand got undressed.
Sorry.
But arent you sweet to calland check up on me.
Harry?
Harry?
Whats wrong?
You told me you wanted meto tell me if I was upset.
What did I do?
Oh, no, honey.
No, its nothing.
You do sound upset.
Something is wrong.
Harry, do I want to hear this?
Would you stop? Let me talk?
Okay. Were you fired?
I accidentally openedKen Cosgroves paycheck.
So?
Whats he gonna care?
Tampering with the U.S. Mail?
He makes 300 a week.
What? That mannequinmakes $300 a week?
Hes not married.
We have one on the way.
I hate this place.
I should quit.
Thats your response?
The hours you work?
Forget about Kenny.
If they have that much money to spend,they should spend it on you.
Youre making that place.
I dont know about that.
What are you worth?
You go in there and ask for it.
Demand it.
Be polite, but think aboutwhat youre worth to them.
No. No, I cant do that.
I didnt know this was aboutyou feeling sorry for yourself.
Im hanging up.
Do you know where I can geta number 10 envelope
with a windowpaneand a green stripe on the side?
No.
I need to lay down.
Yeah. Right.
Well, feel better.
Do you have a number 10 envelopewith a windowpane?
No. Why?
Can you make one?
No. Why?
Can you fix this one?
Make it so it can look unopened?
You need a fake passport, too?
I got Ken Cosgroves paycheck by mistake.
I opened it.
How did that happen?
A mistake.
Well, just throw it away.
Hell ask for it by the end of the day,
and theyll cut him a new one.
Dont throw it away here, though.
People go through the trash.
Of course.
Are you upset about getting caught?
Or are you upset about what you saw?
I dont know if thiswould mean much to you.
Its 300 a week before taxes.
Were married.
I have a baby due in August.
You know what Jennifer said?
She thinks that I should just go inand demand a raise.
You told your wife about this?
I know. I do that. I keep doing it.
- I didnt know what to do.- Theres nothing you can do.
Thats why you dont tell your wife.
Wish you hadnt told me.
I think shes right.
But isnt Media a meritocracy?
You think that?
Whats that supposed to mean, anyway?
I have plenty of merit.
Merit defined within reason.
As in this place cant run without you?
Well, how the hell do I do that?
Then youre worth everypenny theyre paying you.
Thanks, Sal.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Sterling and Ben Cosgroveare here to see you.
Ken.
Bad news.
So bad I dont feel like telling you.Cosgrove.
We were sh**ting Jimmy Barrettfor Utz, and...
Dont pussyfoot around.Just tell him.
Im trying to tell him.
- Give me a cigarette.- Yes, sir.
Why dont you get your own?
We have a whole storeroom full of Luckys.
Because I dont smoke.
Mr. And Mrs. Schillingmade a surprise visit to the set,
and they got the fullJimmy Barrett treatment.
Mr. Rumsens coming in.
I dont care that you drink, Freddie,
- but its interfering with your job.- Whoa.
Only an idiot would putJimmy Barrett in a room with her.
No visits.
How bad was it?
He called her the Hindenburg.
And he said somethingabout the whale in Pinocchio.
Did you laugh in front of the Schillings?
Of course not. I was mortified.
You know, my mothers heavyset.
I stopped it right away.
So what were dealing with hereis you failed to control Jimmy Barrett,
and you failed to control Mr. And Mrs. Utz,
so maybe both of youarent suited for these tasks.
- Mr. Phillips is here.- Perfect.
Utz is gonna lose Jimmy,and were going to lose Utz.
Oh, God. I miss the 50s.
Has anyone tried to save this yetbesides Leopold and Loeb over here?
Cant get the Schillings on the phone.
Someone needs to talk to Jimmy.
Well, Im sure hell feel real badabout it tonight and give her a call.
Don, can you work him over?
Jimmy Barrett is a known quantity.
Dons going to fix it.
He knows what that nut means to Utzand what Utz means to us.
Fix what, exactly?
Fix this mess that was madebecause Freddie got him drunk.
Come on. Cosgrove should havetold me they were here.
I would have never let her near that set.
I did. I told Lois.
I took them by here, but you were out.
Im going to talk to the Schillings,
then Im going to explainthe facts of life to Jimmy.
Thatll work.
A guy like that must knowhow to make a charming apology,
or hed be dead.
Where were you?
At the printers.
You should tell your girl that.
Lois.
Close the door.
Sit down.
No. Stand.
Id like to find a way not to be cruel,
but I dont think itd be servingeither one of us.
Are you firing me?
Oh, no.
Its nice to see that you careabout something.
Are you trying to thinkof what you can possibly say
to make up for whats happened here?
What happened?
I think youre not suited for this job.
What did I do?
In addition to being incompetent,
you threatened my reputation,and not just today.
Mr. Draper, I try to coverfor you all the time.
You do not cover for me.
You manage peoples expectations.
Can you be more specific?
You really want that?
No, I guess not.
Youre not suited for this job.
Its not an insult. Its just the way it is.
Stick to the switchboard.
Please tell Miss Holloway on your way out.
Yes, Mr. Draper.
Is there something duetomorrow I dont know about?
No.
Already finding waysnot to go home, are we?
Edgar Fladen, CBS, please.
- Hello.- Flatty.
Harry Crane. How are you?
Still at work, same as you.
How you like it over there?
Did Sterling Coo losesome of its drunken luster?
I dont know.
I was thinking maybe I haveto move out to move up.
Well, forget about here.Theyre picking us off.
Im one gone paleface.
Well, thought Id ask.
Keep your ear to the groundfor me, will you?
- It doesnt have to be there.- Hey, how about some concern?
I just lost Lever Brothersand Kimberly Clark
from one of my biggest shows.
Were lousy with sponsors over here.What do you need?
Dont get excited.
Sponsors drop out for a reason.
Not always.
Okay. Try this on.
The Defenders. Top 20 show.
E.G. Marshall, Bob Reed.
Lawyers, but, you know, they really care.
So the writers turn in this scriptabout a cannibal.
A cannibal lawyer?
The director eats up all this timerefusing to do it,
like his r?sum? isnt filled with crap,
and surprise, the writers haveonly one other script ready...
something we threw away last year
because they used the word "ab*rtion"30 times in 51 minutes.
Why?
Because they show one, opening scene.
Exactly.
The whole thing was a ployto get us to sh**t it.
They think theyre so clever.
I tell you, I miss the blacklist.
Send it over. I want to see it.
Im sure.
Its going on the air, sponsor or no.
Ill watch it with you in the barwhere Ill be working.
Send it over.Let me see what I can do.
All right.
Miss Holloway, good morning.
I will be taking care of youwhile we search for a suitable candidate.
I am really sorry about that.
Did she leave everythingin a condition you can follow?
Perhaps if you were involvedin the selection.
What can I tell?
Ill just continue lookingfor another Miss Olson.
No. I want someonewholl be happy with that job.
Well, for the time being, thats me.
How about a cup of coffee?
I think I remember how you take it.
Sure.
Is Jimmy Barrett sh**ting today?
Yes. At EUE.
What time do they start?
They were supposed to start this morning,
but Mr. Barretts been showing up around 4.
Wake me at 3:30.
Well start with your correspondence.
Did you go to that office
for the purpose of obtainingan illegal operation?
Yes.
Were you pregnant?
Yes.
Then you went to Dr. Montgomeryfor an ab*rtion.
Yes.
Was the ab*rtion performed?
Just a moment.
Mr. Preston, arent you going to object?
The witness is nota qualified medical expert.
The defense is willing to concede
that an operation was performedon Miss Stafford,
which resulted in the terminationof a pregnancy.
Very well. You may proceed.
Come here a lot, do you?
Not if everythings running smoothly.
So buy me a drink.
I think theres been plenty of drinking here.
Jimmy around?
He left early. Rehearsal at the Copa.
Forgot this.
Isnt that our tuxedo?
He likes it better.
Great. So lets go talk to him.
Theres no reason for that.
Talk to his manager.
How can I help you?
Im sorry.
In the pitch, you wereintroduced as his wife.
Would you prefer I pretend to be his sister,like I did in the old days?
Wife, manager, someone should havekept a lid on him yesterday.
Ive seen the man sober.Hes not funny.
- Mrs. Barrett...- Bobbie.
He can come in here with vomitin his pockets for all I care,
but these people are his benefactors.
Like the Medicis of Florence,
theyre patrons of his art.
Mr. And Mrs. Utz.
I want you to imagine somethingthat Jimmy obviously cant.
The Schillings were very excitedto see their favorite comedian.
Then they know that being picked onby Jimmy Barrett is a compliment.
No one was laughing.
Thats not what I heard.
Ill tell you what.
Theyre in the big city for the weekend.
Why dont they just go outand buy a thicker skin?
You are aware that all of thiscan go away.
No more free tuxedos?
We have a contract.
Tell Jimmy I need to talk to him.
You?
Jimmy doesnt have a lotof patience for business
or for businessmen.
In fact, Im pretty surehe already hates you.
Really?
Some glib ad man in that suit,
cigarette perfectly in hand,not a hair out of place,
here to tell him hes been a bad boy?
Well, he has been.
So what do you suggest I do?
Well...
he has to know that youre a fan
and that he knows more than you
and that hes got a sh*t with your wife.
Girlfriend? Both?
Wife.
So whos gonna havea talk with him, you or me?
Neither of us.
I have to go.
Let me drive you over.
Give up, will you?
Its raining.
Whats that?
Hail.
I dont want to do this.
Doesnt feel that way.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, you.
How was work?
Fine.
Can I ask Daddy?
What do you want?
Im fine.
You can ask him, but hes notgonna disagree with me.
Ask me what?
Can we go ridingwith Mommy on Saturday?
No.
There are just gonna be mommies there.
Ill need you to watch them.
- Its a couple of hours.- Okay.
But she promised.
"She"?
Not this Saturday. It didnt work out.
You can ride me around the den.
I picked up your watch. Good as new.
Open it.
I got it monogrammed.
Wow, Bets.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
I think shes out of gas.
Thought Id fill her up.
They feed them in the barn.
Youre ruining that horsefor whoever has her next.
I want it on record.
She was ruined when I got to her.
Just pull up on the reins.Straighten her out.
You cant let her do that.
You dont for a minute thinkyou might be hurting her?
She needs to be told what to do.Dont be afraid.
Im not afraid, but I am curiouswhy Im riding Nehi
and youve got Copenhagen.
Some horses have better names.
Wheres your girl friend, Mrs. Carson?
Her daughter has a ballet recital.
Im really not afraid, you know?
Ive just always been morecomfortable with animals
when they were onthe other end of my r*fle.
Thats a terrible attitude.
It is, and Ive tried to explain it to Tara,but she wont listen.
All the men in her family ride like this.
They also dont work,so maybe Im wrong about it.
I should go warm him up.
Tally-ho.
Ill be right back.
Hello.
Hello. Its Don Draper.
Can you talk?
Im glad you called.
How are you?
Werent you afraid youd get Jimmy?
No. I wanted to invite you both to dinner.
Monday night.
A command performance.
I was thinking Lut?ce.
It will be formal. Can you get him there?
I told you. He does whatever I say.
Keep it small.
My wife, the Schillings, you.
Okay. If thats what you want.
What do you want?
So...
its that kind of phone call, is it?
Where are you?
In my home.
With my children.
Really?
I like being bad and thengoing home and being good.
Ill see you Monday.
Have a wonderful weekend.
Did you have a nice ride?
Dont smoke in here. They hate it.
I dont know.
Place burns down, I could give this up.
I assume youre trying to be funny,but most of the people who ride...
Hold on.
Mrs. Draper, Im so sorry.Thats not what I meant.
Just because you dont knowwhat youre doing
doesnt mean the rest of us are silly.
I apologize.
Girls and their horses.
I cant figure you out.
Why would you want to do that?
When Tara came to visit,I could tell she was jealous.
Of your two old lady friends.
She certainly seems likea girl who has everything.
She does.
When she was at Wellesley,
she came for a coupleof weekends to New Haven.
I remember those.
So exciting.
We got into a kind of patternwhere thered be a warm reunion,
a football game, and some kindof obscure argument.
You know, I would sootheand she would pout.
You know, Mr. Case,having been married for some time,
I can tell you your fianc?ewould be very unhappy
with you sharing this with a stranger.
Arthur.
I dont know why I brought that up.
I guess I just remembered going homewith her that first time.
Pulling off the Merritt Parkwayand hitting this long, private road.
You know that Scott Fitzgerald story,A Diamond as Big as the Ritz?
No.
Her house is a slightly smaller versionof my high school.
And I realized why she wasso happy all the time
and why she was so angrywhen she didnt get what she wanted.
All girls are like that.
- You arent.- You dont know that.
You are so beautiful.
Thank you.
So different than Tara.
Tara is very beautiful. You know that.
She doesnt need anything.
What she does need, anyone can get her.
Youre nervous about getting married.
Youll see.
You dont know what shell mean to you.
But I think about you.
Why would you do that?
Arthur, I like being around you.
Dont say anything to ruin that.
Youre so profoundly sad.
No.
Its just my people are Nordic.
Dont do that.
Dont tell me what to do.
Youre so profoundly sad.


Youre wrong.
Im grateful.
Hey.
How was it?
Im sorry Im late.
Thank you for watching them.
Come in here.
I should get cleaned up.
I dont care.
Listen.
How do you feel aboutLut?ce Monday night?
Lut?ce?
Pleased, I guess.
And you get to meet Jimmy Barrett.
Why?
Business.
Hunt Schilling fromUtz Potato Chips and wives.
Is this one where I talk or I dont talk?
You need to charm him.
I need you to be shiny and bright.
I need a better half.
Monday night.
You have plans?
Ill have to find something to wear.
Its no notice. No notice at all.
Birdie, well go there alone another time.
What is it?
What is it?Whats this got to do with you?
"He helped me," says Sam.
Is this you?
Theyre writing this about you?
Answer me!Are you mixed up in this?
- Answer me!- Mr. Mason.
You keep out of this!
Sandra Mason.
I was reading about this.
I was thanking God that my daughter
wasnt the kind of a girl that was...
would be mixed upin anything ugly like this.
Please, Daddy, dont.
I was even feeling sorry for the parentsof the girls who were involved.
- Please. Please.- Please?
18 years old!
You have to have an illegitimate child
taken away from you by some filthy doctor!
Mr. Mason!
You get out of my house!
I do want to see the rest of this,but I get the idea.
Then behave as though you...
Top 20 show, prime time,for pennies on the dollar.
And its the perfect matchfor Belle Jolie lipstick.
Really? How does that work?
Controversy means viewers.
Women will find a way to watch this.
Maybe just becausethey dont want to get left out.
Is that true?
Theres no doubt in my mind.
We can talk to themabout putting on a warning.
Research shows rulesare made to be broken.
Thanks, Ken. He has the research.
This discussion, its uncomfortable.
This show is troubling.
Its catharsis. Thats hard to come by.
What is better than tears to make a girlready to hear she can be beautiful?
Id love to see a spike.
But what do I do when Hugh Brodyasks what the hell this is?
Belle Jolie is a family company.
This is not wholesome.
There are limits to whatyou can get out of daytime.
I dont want Belle Jolieto be part of this debate.
So you think girls who buy lipstickarent gonna be interested in this?
I dont care where they stand.So its political.
Politics are in.Women will be watching.
Young women.
Im sorry.
Well, we thought you should know about it.
I have to say Im very impressedyou brought this to us.
I wish we werea different kind of company.
We all work for someone.
It was a pleasure.
Hows it going?
Very well, thank you.
You said you wanted to see me?
Yes, I did.
Youre Harry Crane, right?
Yes, I am.
Certain things have come to my attention.
Oh, no.
I heard about it third-hand,and I thought it sounded reckless,
so I talked to Mr. Cooper.
Mr. Cooper knows about this?
I think someone told on you.
And it backfired.
- Mitch.- Doesnt matter.
Cooper thought it showed initiative.
So youre in here now.
Im smiling. What do you want?
Well...
I guess, for one thing,
I think that we should havea television department.
All the other agencies have them.
And I think I should run it.
Youre now the headof the Television Department,
which is comprised solely of you.
Anything else?
Well, actually...
I think I deserve a raise.
And I think...
youve already received a sizable reward.
Lets not get greedy.
Im not being greedy.
Are you arguing with me?
How much do you make?
- $200 a week.- Plus drinks.
Give me a number.
How about 310?
No one makes that around here.Not even close.
How about two and a quarter? Say yes.
Yes.
Ill throw in new business cards.
You drive a hell of a bargain.
So I finally told themthat we really enjoyed visiting,
but wed rather stay in a hotel.
Made my daughter-in-law happier.
Luckily, were a long wayfrom those problems.
Although, I do love the ideaof Bobby and Sally
having apartments and families.
Where is he?
Who?
Jimmy Barrett.
I...
No, Hunt.
I dont think that would be a good idea.
Edith, please.
He wants to apologize.
Oh, dear.
Well, he certainly picked a nice place.
Hello, everybody.Sorry were late,
but one of us likes to make an entrance.
Hello. Bobbie Barrett.
Pleasure.
- Weve met before.- I remember.
Mr. Draper.
This is my wife Betty.
Betty, this is Bobbie and Jimmy Barrett.
Oh, my. I am such a fan.
You know, when you imaginesomeone saying that to you,
you always hope its her.
And this one. My God.Are you two sold separately?
Look, its JFK.
And youre not Jackie,but youre definitely his type.
Ive met him.
Nice to see you again, Jimmy.
You remember Hunt and Edith Schilling.
How could I forget?They bought me a car.
A pleasure as always.
And the little lady.Look at you, all dolled up.
So, what do you do, sweetheart?
I want to know everything.
Im a housewife.
I bet little birds hang up your laundry.
And we have a little boy and a little girl.
Is that everything? Or you wantto let my imagination run wild?
By the way, I loved youin Gentlemans Agreement.
Good evening, mesdames et messieurs.
The chef has prepared many sp?cialit?s
which I will have the pleasure of...
Just a minute, Monsieur Le Pew.
Any chance we can get a drink order filled?
Sorry, everybody,but Jimmys down a quart.
Two Johnnie Walkers, rocks.Bobbie, you want anything?
Dubonnet with a twist.
And make it fast,while this place is still French.
I hope you all like spit in your food.
Come on. I come here all the time.
Now, I have a few keyquestions for Mrs. America.
Remember, Betsy,everythings riding on this.
So really, what fills your days?
Eating bonbons?
Hitting tennis balls with the needy?
Actually, I spend a lotof my time riding horses.
Its really a passion for me.
And for them, I bet.
So, big horses?Give me an education.
- You dont want to hear about this.- No, I do.
Is it the beauty pageant thingwhere they walk in little bitty steps?
Ill be right back.
No. Thats dressage.
I knew that.
Its the same kind of saddle,but I do jumping.
You two do any jumping?
Im sorry.
Can you excuse me a moment?
All this talk about horses?
What, are you expecting a Chinese baby?
I dont know what it is,
but one thing I know is its not Chinese.
Were both very proud of you.
Well, good.
Because a 121/2% raiseis nothing to sneeze at.
I dont care about the money.
Well... the moneys nice.
I just cant wait to gointo the phone company tomorrow
and tell the girls that my husband
is the head of televisionat Sterling Cooper.
Do you feel well enough to go in?
Because you dont have to.
Youre sweet.
What did you do?
Well, I took this TV showthat no one wanted to sponsor,
and I told one of our clients about it.
And you sold it?
No, but everyone was impressedthat I recognized the opportunity.
Whats the show?
Just some show.
You wouldnt like it.
You look great.
Do I?
Im not feeling great.
Why not?
Im gonna be brief
because I dont likeleaving him alone out there.
Theyre loving it.
Theyre being polite.
The window for this apology is closing.
It needs to happen before the appetizers,or they will leave.
Really?
Because I was thinking about that,
so I took a look at Jimmys contract...
well, me and a lawyer...
and I realized Jimmy doesnthave to apologize at all.
In fact, theyre gonna have to pay him,even if they fire him,
especially because hurt feelingsisnt a very good reason.
So what is this all about?
I think an apology,and a public one like this one,
has to be worth $25,000.
And I want it in the paper.
Say its a bonus.
Believe me, I will ruin him.
Do what I say.
- Dont get up.- I wasnt gonna.
But this one knows about horses.Who knows?
Ive been spending the whole timewatching her lips move.
Well, I hope we havent ordered yetbecause there really is something
that we need to get out of the way.
Hes picking up the check.
I mean, theres really no debate, is there?
Mr. And Mrs. Schilling,
Jimmy has somethingthat hed like to say to you.
Honestly, Id rather eat your chipsthan anything in this dump.
They have snails here, you know.
Thats nice to hear.
Mrs. Schilling... Edith...
I was out of line the other day.
I shouldnt have said it to you,and not just cause youre married to him.
I shouldnt have said it to anybody,not in that environment.
Sweetheart, look at me.
You, too, Hunt. Can I call you Hunt?
Theres the guy under the lights,and theres me.
Hes made me rich,but he hasnt made me very nice.
I hope we can put it behind us.
I know thats what you do.
I guess I just dont have the stomach for it.
Well, Im famished.
Excuse me.
Bets, you all right?
Yes.
Whats wrong?
Nothing.
Nothings wrong.
Im just so happy.
When I said I wanted to bea part of your life...
this is what I meant.
We make a great team.
