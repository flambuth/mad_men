Im interested in today. That was Friday.
Look, Ill clear lunch plus one hour
and well grab a sandwichand discuss this face to face.
Im hanging up.
Is it broken?
The lamp?
What are you doing all the way over there?
Its too hot.
Would you settle for a leg?
Id be grateful.
Its cold and soft.
Im the softest.
So which one of usis gonna look at the clock first?
I caught it when I was picking up the lamp.
Im already late.
For what?
Secor Laxatives.
Did I spoil the mood?
What do you have to do?
I have a 4:00 at Erwin, Wasey.
Doing what?
I cant tell you that, Mr. Bond.
I told you.
What are you working on over there?
I dont tell them what Im doing for you.
But youre not lying in bedwith them right now either.
Do you know what a Chinese wall is?
I really should go.
Can I get in the bathroom first?
Just take your time.
Let yourself out.
Lock the door behind you, as a courtesy.
You wanna leave me here?
You sure?
Im taking everything interesting with me.
I dont understand. Do you honestly thinkmy book isnt better than Ogilvys?
Mines got a story.Its got mystery, intrigue, romance.
I tell you what else its got.Its got examples of how to sell things.
Hold on.
Im on the phone.
Its Mrs. Sterling.Shes leaving for the weekend.
Its only Wednesday,and they have phones in Southampton.
Ira, I dont want to sound ungrateful.I just think...
Hello? Hello?
Oh, shit.
Come in.
These need signatures, not initials.
Caroline said you refused?
Its just so much more work.
I was just giving her a hard time.
Can I interest you in the same?
And Im supposed to tell you in personthat Mr. Pryce will be taking off
the last two weeks of Augustfor his sons visit.
You had to tell me that in person?
-So depressing.-He doesnt want a memo circulating.
Hes afraid people will stop working.
What are you doing in August?
Im not sure.
Well, what are you doing this afternoon?
The same thingI do every afternoon, working,
which is what Im trying to do right now.
Its not cute.
Jeanie.
Jesus. Im sorry.
What did you say to her?
What does that have to do with you?
Her husband got called up.
Hes going to Vietnam right after basic.
Vietnam.
Thats not good.
Its okay.Weve all been walking on eggshells.
Good afternoon, all.
I know you dont like to be b*mbthe moment you walk in,
but Fillmore and Secorare both coming in tomorrow.
I cant move forward with eitheruntil you sign off
on what I worked through lunch to finish.
Im sorry.I had a long lunch, went for a swim.
Come back in an hour. Im taking a nap.
Its a business of sadists and masochists,and you know which one you are.
-Hi.-Peggy, your boyfriends here.
Satisfaction guaranteed.
-Why are you here?-Thought we could get a drink,
sh**t the bull.-Sure. What time? Where?
When youre aloneAnd life is making you lonely
You can always go
7:00, P.J. Clarkes.
Midtown
Ill meet you in the lobby.
Down below.
Give it a break, Jughead.
Im not shocked by your lesbian hijinks.
I just hope you know you can never dowhat a man can do.
Thats true.
Bad news. Don showed up. Were on at 4:00.
-How was your siesta? Are you refreshed?-Yes.
Dr. Miller returned your call.
She said not to wake youand you neednt return.
But she got the message,and youre gonna have to wait.
-Thank you.-Are you going to the toilet?
I have to hire more copywriters,but these men come in and I know
the better they are,the more my job is in danger.
Oh, my.
Look whos here. Abe.
Peggy, I dont know if you rememberAbe Drexler from Kelloggs loft party.
-Hi, Im Peggy.-I remember.
Abe, you want to join us for a drink?
-Yes, please do.-Stay. Ill just stand here.
Can I get a Johnnie Walker with ice?
He didnt hear me.
You know what? Im gonna go play darts.
-Take my seat.-Are you sure?
Pay for that. See you kids later.
Im sorry.Shes always so damn self-amused.
What are you talking about?
I was gonna stop by your office,but I didnt want to get you in trouble.
Then I thought about finding outwhere you live, but thats weird.
So anyway,
-its nice running into you.-I dont know what to say.
Thats very flattering-
Thats howl meant it.
Johnnie Walker. Rocks.
The bartender here listens to me.
-May I help you?-Are you Joan Harris?
-I am.-Were from Madam lngas.
You are to receive massage,manicure and pedicure.
-Can we?-I didnt order this.
Its a gift from a friend, tip included.
-What friend?-Im not allowed to say this.
In Greece right now?Make no mistake, thats a revolution.
We are a hair away from everythingfalling apart in every society.
Its so tenuous.
All these corporationsjust throw their money at everyone
to keep the status quo intactcause the people outnumber them.
But in the blink of an eye,they could overturn everything.
Its an illusion that Americas so organizedand it could never happen over here.
-Are you from Brooklyn?-I am.
-Me, too.-I dont hear it.
One more drink and itll come out.
Okay.
What am I talking to youabout corporations for?
-You must deal with them all the time.-I guess.
Vick chemical, American tobacco,
but most of them are family businesses,
Samsonite, Fillmore Auto Parts,Sugarberry Ham...
Fillmore Auto Parts is worse thana corporation, what with the boycott and all.
-What boycott?-The Southern stores wont hire negroes.
Says who?
It was in the Voice.It was in a couple of places.
I dont think thats true.I wouldve heard that.
It is true.
That doesnt seem like them.
Im sure theyre perfectly nice for r*cist,you know,
and obviously your company hasan investment in looking the other way.
Well, its a complicated idea,
but in advertising,we dont really judge people.
We try and help them outof these situations.
Certainly we would try and stop this.
If its true, its not good for their business.
Jesus, I dont even know where to start.
You wouldve donea campaign for Goldwater?
You kidding?That wouldve been spectacular.
-Did you vote for him?-Of course not.
Civil rights isnt a situation to be fixedwith some PR campaign.
Its an inequalitythat the world has its eyes on.
I know.
But I have to say,
most of the things negroes cant do,I cant do either,
and nobody seems to care.
What are you talking about?
Half of the meetings take placeover golf, tennis,
in a bunch of clubswhere Im not allowed to be a member,
or even enter.
The University Club saidthe only way I could eat dinner there
was if I arrived in a cake.
Theres no n*gro copywriters, you know.
Im sure they could fight their way inlike I did.
Believe me, nobody wanted me there.
All right, Peggy.Well have a civil rights march for women.
I have a really early day.
It was nice to see you again.
Im just saying theyre not sh**ting womento keep them from voting. Thats all.
Jesus. Im really sorry.
Im much better on paper.
Youre opinionatedand youre criticizing me.
Thats not what Im doing. This is discourse.
I knew I shouldnt have let Joyce leave.
Have a good night.
A three-letter word for a flightless bird.
Emu.
Nope. It starts with an "L."
The hell it does.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Could I get some coffee?And let me know when Dr. Miller arrives.
Its hard, the way she breezes past me.
Shes pushy, that one.
I guess thats what it takes.
-Morning.-Good morning.
-And thank you.-For what?
That was very thoughtful.
I Knew I was rubbing you the wrong way,
so I thought, why not havesomeone rub you the right way?
-I brought you bear claws.-Caroline wont let me have one
unless its on the end of a real bear.
-Well, anyway.-Jeanie.
-itll be okay.-People love to say that.
Look, I know youre having a tough run.
Let me get you a meal.
Take your mind off things?
Of course.
I forgot for a second that youreincapable of doing something nice
without expecting something nicer in return.
I didnt mean anything by it.
Honest.
Just thought you could use a night out.
-Thank you. Im fine.-Good.
-What are you doing here?-I wrote something.
I kind of wrote it for you.
I would love it if you read it.
Nuremberg on Madison Avenue?
-What is this?-its what I was trying to say last night,
but without, I dont know, my abrasive tone.Read it.
Right now in front of you?
No, take your time. Ill wait over here.
I have a lot to do.
I came all the way up here.I want to know what you think, okay?
These domesticated suburbanites
still have a primitive desireto get their hands dirty,
but they have becomeso removed from nature that they cant.
They dont know how to huntor swing a hammer or fix their cars.
You mean like these two.
Actually, no. Im from Vermont,and Dons a competitive fly fisherman.
What our findings showis that this demographic
will spend a good amount of money
for the satisfactionof being useful with their hands.
Ladies love a manwhos good with his hands.
You think a mechanic comes inand sees these jokers
looking at fan belts,hes gonna stick around?
No offense.
Whats the difference?Our inventorys the same.
I think if they see a coat and tie in aisle four,theyll think our prices went up.
I know I would.
Listen, salt of the earth,we need more than mechanics to survive.
You ever hear of Sears? Theyll k*ll us.
We agreed we all had to agree.
Dont we have enough problemswith the boycott?
Look, I dont want to get involvedin a family squabble,
but I cant move forwarduntil you agree on a strategy.
What if there were a wayto market to both groups?
"Fillmore Auto Parts.
"Where the pros go,and everyones welcome."
-its a little corny.-its great and you know it.
Thats not a strategy. Thats two strategiesconnected by the word "and."
I can do "where the pros go,"or I can do "everyones welcome,"
-but not both.-Sure you can.
Someone has to make a decision.There are three of you.
Vote.
Sean, what do you think?
-...dont know.-What?
Youll have to excuse me for a moment.Continue, please.
Why do we have to convince him?
What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
I am so sorry. Who are you?
My name is Vivian Winters,
and Im going to assume youre her fathersince thats what shes led me to believe.
Don. What exactly is going on?
I found her on the train between carriagestrying to avoid the conductor.
I didnt have enough money.
Megan, could you take her to my office?
Go.
Thank you.
Can I pay you for the ticket and your time?
Youre just very lucky I ran into herbefore someone else did.
The types on that train?Someone should keep track of her.
Youre right. I didnt know.
Men never know whats going on.
I offered you money and I said thank you.
She looks so chubby in the pictures.
Get her mother on the phone now.
What do you think youre doing?
I wanted to see youand I didnt want to wait two weekends.
You cant do this. This is very serious.
Mrs. Francis is on the line.
Guess whos sitting on my couch right now.
What are you talking about?
Im talking about a strangerbringing Sally to my office
because she got on the train with no money.
Youre kidding.
Carla was supposedto pick her up after the doctor.
How the hell did this happen?
Dr. Keener thought it would be good for her
to walk from campto her appointment by herself.
Great idea. Thank you, psychiatry.
Dont yell at me.She needs to learn responsibility.
You need to learn responsibility.
Now come get her.Ive got a business to run here.
Because its so easy.Its so much fun to take care of her.
Enjoy.
-What?-Enjoy, Don.
Im meeting Henry in the citytomorrow night. Ill get her then.
Dont move and dont touch anything.
I dont want to hear it.Just make sure she doesnt leave that room.
Are you serious with this?
Everyone knowswho represents Fillmore Auto Parts.
-Were the agency of record.-But I was defending you.
We have a religion in this countryand its business.
Youre not a priest.Youre just another congregant.
So Im not a w*r criminal.
Look, why should someonenice like you have to do this?
Why should you have to be a partof that corruption?
Its a waste of yoursand a million other artists gifts.
If you publish this, Ill lose my job.
Maybe youre better than this.
Im not a political person.
I dont have to defend myself.
Youre political whether you like it or not.
And youre not supposed to be insulted,youre supposed to be flattered.
Are you crazy?
You inspired me. I wrote this for you.
I guess I read you wrong.
You look so earnest.
I need your word that youll destroy that.
Sure.
I wont bother you again.
Miss Blankenship.
Miss Blankenship, are you all right?
Miss Blankenship.
Miss Blankenship.
Caroline. Oh, God. Caroline!
-Do not come out of there.-I know!
What now?
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.Im really sorry to bother you again.
-Are you sure?-Im afraid so.
What happened?
Jesus.
Poor thing.
Should we call an ambulance?
The coroner.
What about them?
-Ill attend to this.-Sallys in there.
-Why?-Shes visiting.
Megan, get a man, and well need a blanket.
Theres an afghan on Mr. Cranes couch.
She seemed fine just a minute ago.
So where are we?
-Have we agreed on a strategy?-Im not sure.
This is where we are.
Correct me if Im wrong, gentlemen,
but we believe by holdingonto Fillmores reputation
as a place for professional mechanics,we can actually attract men of all types.
So its something like
"Fillmore Auto Parts.For the mechanic in every man."
And although it seems immaterial to you,the Fillmore brothers like it.
Unanimously.
What was that again?
"Fillmore Auto Parts.For the mechanic in every man."
My mother made that.
Can we get your signature?
Im the president.
I think this is a winner.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
-Ken, can you show them out?-Of course. This way.
My goodness. I was just talking to her-
Listen, my daughter is sitting in my office.
-What?-She decided to run away today.
-Sally?-Id really appreciate it
if you could go in my bag, get my keys,
take her to my apartmentand just sit with her.
Are you sure?
I would have my secretary do it,but shes dead.
No, of course.Okay, do you want to introduce me?
I mean, what do I say to her?
Do we really have to havethis discussion right now?
Youre Faye.
Find Cooper and Roger at lunch
and stop themfrom bringing Secor back here.
Sally, this is my friend Faye.
-Shes going to take you to my apartment.-why?
You dont want this to get worse.Believe me.
Hello. My name is Faye.
I know. My dad just said that.
Stop.
-Where are they taking her?-Shes going to the morgue.
No, shes not.Shes going to Frank E. Campbell.
Anyone track down her family?
She has a niece. Ill call her.
Im sorry, Bert.
Roger.
You should go home.
-Yes. Take all my calls up here.-Okay.
So Fitzgerald says,“I promised to pour this whiskey
"over your grave earlier, but do you mindif I pass it through me kidneys first?"
-Are you all right?-Damn it, I dont want to die in this office.
-I almost have twice.-Stop it.
If it looks like Im going, open a window.Id rather flatten the top of a cab.
You are not going to die in this office.
Poor Ida.
She died like she lived.
Surrounded by the peopleshe answered phones for.
Im gonna go to my favorite restaurantand have a glass of cyanide.
Or you could join me.
I dont know.
-Im gonna k*ll myself, Jeanie.-No, youre not.
Go get your things.Ill meet you in the lobby.
I got it.
-Hello, Daddy.-Dont "Hello, Daddy" me.
Go sit down.
-How was it?-Great.


We watched a little TV, one of us took a nap.
You want to stay? Youre gonna need to eat.
I Know, but I have dinner plans.
-Thank you.-Glad I could help.
-Good night, Sally.-Good night,
Can we order a pizza?
I want you to promise meyoure never going to do this again.
I promise.
Why did you always pick this place?
No chance of running into anyoneand, of course, cherry cheesecake.
Well, the clientele is older than I remember.
But not us.
I wish you would talk to me about things.
My husband doesnt like it.
I know its tough,
but you mustve knownabout the possibilities when he signed up.
I wasnt consulted.
Youre kidding.
Because you alwaystell Jane about all of your decisions?
Shes the woman behind the man, isnt she?
Did you listen to my memoirs?
I just have them transcribedand recycle the tapes.
And youre not a little curiousif theres a chapter called "Joan"?
There better not be.
I know. Thats the problem.
And every time I think back,all the good stuff was with you.
And Im sorry I keep pestering you.
I just cant help myself.
I dont expect anything to happen.
I appreciate that.
Can I ask you something?
Yes, Im still mad at you.
Are you going to marry Faye?
What? No.
-Is she your girlfriend?-No.
She had your keys.
I gave her my keys.
She knew you had peanut butter.
Everyone has peanut butter.
She Said She Wanted to meet me.
Why would she want to meet me?
Look, I do like her,
but we just work together,and I talk about you a lot.
Do you like her?
-She seems nice.-Well, good.
Maybe youll get to see her again some time.
Get out some plates.
Cause I didnt want to take a cabon Broadway. Its a beautiful night.
I dont like this neighborhood anymore.What happened?
Miss Blankenship,youre not missing anything.
-Do you know what time it is?-I do.
Oh, God.
You know what to do.
-Roger...-Yes. Yes, we do. Look down.
Everythings going to be fine.
-There you go.-What about her?
Your bag.
Rings.
Thats everything.We havent seen anything.
I cant breathe.
-I want to scream.-Dont. Come over here.
-You have to calm down.-My ring. My ring.
Stop it. Everything can be replaced.
Youre fine.
Dont stop.
Are you sure you dont wantto call your mother or your brothers?
Its 9:30. Theyre asleep.
Daddy, I love you so much.
I love you, too.
Did you brush your hair?
I want to live with you all the time.
You cant do that, honey.
Why not? Ill be good.
Where are you gonna goto school down here?
What about your friends?What about your brothers?
They could live here, too. Ill watch them.
Sally.
Go to sleep.
-Sally?-I made French toast.
You know I dont like you using the stove.
Daddy, I do it all the time.
And theres no shells in it.
Do you want me to turn on the TV?We can watch The Today Show.
No.
-Whered you learn how to do this?-Carla taught me.
Whats on this?
Mrs. Butterworths.
Go get it.
Thats rum. Read labels.
Is it bad?
Not really.
Get dressedand Ill get you a bun at the office.
Cant we do something?
All right, heres the deal. No negotiating.
Im gonna call in, move everything to noon,and were gonna go to the Central Park Zoo.
And the dinosaur museum?
One or the other. We only have till noon.
You finish your breakfast.Im going to get ready.
You want me to get Don to do it?
Of course, he didnt really know her.
No, he didnt.
Caroline, get Mrs. Harris.
Its regarding Ida Blankenships obit.
That ought to get her in here.
This is an insult to her.I cant think of anything.
And I have no office in which to ruminate.
Coopers trying to write an obit,something sharp and sweet.
Well, Mr. Cooper, shall we say,
"Loyal friend, devoted caretaker..."
Put "quietly in her sleep," of course.
-Whats her profession? Secretary?-Executive secretary.
She was born in 1898 in a barn.
She died on the 37th floor of a skyscraper.
Shes an astronaut.
Is this what it took to get you in here?
Look, Im sorry.
It was in the heat of the moment.
And there was a moment. You know that.
Im not sorry,
but Im married.
And so are you.
I feel something, and I know you do.
Good afternoon.
-Hello.-Sally, this is Megan.
Wheres Miss Blankenship?
She went away.Im helping out for a little bit.
Her mother should be by at 5:00.Can you handle five minutes?
Are you hungry?
She ate plenty.
Im gonna get coffee and check in.
Shit. Now we cant leave-
Harry said, on the form where it says"cause of death," they wrote "Don Draper."
How long do you thinkYvette Mimieuxs gonna last on his desk?
I say we start a poolon whether shes tired, quits or dies.
Wheres Dr. Miller?
-I dont know if shes coming in.-She is.
The Fillmores want a jingle, a catchy tune.
Dont do that.
Harry says no rock and rollif we want middle-class men.
He was pushing Perry Como.
And we had Pat Boone, Roger Miller,Frankie Laine, Duane Eddy.
Im glad I came in for this.
How about Harry Belafonte?
Everyone likes him.
Ill get you tickets to Harry Belafonte.
Believe me, he aint selling auto partsfor these guys.
Maybe itll help themwith their image in the South.
They dont want help.
Have you ever been to the South?
Cause they have a way of doing things,and it doesnt include Harry Belafonte.
The Fillmore brothers are from Boston.
Same thing.
Why are we doing businesswith someone who doesnt hire negroes?
Our job is to make men like Fillmore Auto,not Fillmore Auto like negroes.
Pick one, get it written and recorded,
and if they want to change it,we will charge them to change it.
How about Dean Martin?Hes friends with Sammy Davis Jr.
Does that work for you, Peggy?
Mrs. Francis is goingto be in the lobby any minute.
I have to cover reception, per Joans orders.
Go ahead.
Your mothers goingto be downstairs in a minute.
-Get your things,-I wanna stay.
You cant.
I want to stay and I dont know why I cant.
Because you have to go home.
Ill be good. I promise.
-Come on.-No.
No! No!
No, no! Im not going anywhere! Stop it!
Do you want me to carry you out of here?
Im not going. Im not leaving. I hate it there!
Is everything okay?
-Can you talk to her?-What?
Please. I cant bring her backkicking and screaming to her mother.
-I dont have much child psychology.-Just talk to her.
Dr. Faye wants to talk to you.
Hi, Sally. Remember me from yesterday?
I know you dont want to go,but you have to.
Your mother came all the way out here.
You dont know my mother.
Sally.
Sally,
sometimes we have to do thingswe dont want to do.
-Shut up.-Whats gotten into you?
I dont think Im helping here.
We dont want your help.
-Lets go, now.-Stop it! No! Stop it!
Its gonna be all right.
No, its not.
I fall all the time.
I was coming to get you. Mrs... Your...
Sallys mother is in reception.
Thank you.
I was worried about you.
Come on, lets go.
I was waiting in the lobby at 5:00.
-We lost track of time.-Now Im late.
Sally?
Say goodbye to your father.
Goodbye.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hi. Are you here to see Peggy?
Can you make me one of those?
No. No, I cant.
I cant do anything for you.
Why are you upset?
You shouldnt have put me in that position.
Things happen. I didnt plan it.
You asked me to go watch her.
There was no one else to do it.
And just now? What the hell was that?
Im not good with kids.
That was not your fault.
Well, it feels like there was a testand l failed it.
God knows Id be lyingif I said it didnt cross my mind,
would I meet your children?When would I meet your children?
But I dont have any.
Im sorry.
I love children, but I chose to be where I am.
I dont view it as a failure.
It doesnt matter.
I mean it.
Jesus. What a mess.
Part of its good, right?
Yeah.
Im gonna go. I didnt really sleep.
We can have dinner this weekend.Ill pick a place.
Good.
Why are you drinking here?
Come on.
I dont know what kind of surpriseyoure gonna spring on me.
So Abe Drexler pulled a boner.its to be expected.
He seemed so nice.
Hes a man.He wont be happy until he turns you out.
Whats that supposed to mean?
You gotta be their girl.Its the way they want it. Maybe its biology.
Its like men are this vegetable soup,
and we cant put them on a plateor eat them off the counter.
So women are the pot.
They heat them up. They hold them.They contain them.
But who wants to be a pot?
Who the hell said were not soup?
I dont think thats true.
Its been my experience.
But you know,I wouldnt have helped Abe out
if I didnt thinkhe was some very interesting soup.
Listen, go ahead without me.
Another time.
Are you angry or lovesick?
I dont know.
Night, Peg.
Could you hold that?
Hello.
