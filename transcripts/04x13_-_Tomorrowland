Hello?
I still have to pack for a 7:00 a.m. flight,thanks to you.
Will you at least put me out of my miserybefore you go?
Stop it. American Cancer loved the letter,and theyre gonna love you.
And then youre gonna stop working,take your Kids to California and have a ball.
I have this sick feelingin the pit of my stomach.
Listen, maybe its not all about work.
Maybe that sick feeling might go away
if you take your head out of the sandabout the past.
You know its not that simple.
Of course it isnt,and you dont have to do it alone.
But if you resolve some of that,
you might be more comfortablewith everything.
And then what happens?
And then youre stuck trying to be a personlike the rest of us.
Ill call you Tuesday when you get back.
Im gonna miss you, you know.
-Any outgoing?-Mail?
Just this.
Dont post it. its for you.
Its been discussed among the partnersthat you be promoted
to director of agency operations.
-My goodness.-Now, its a dreadful reality
that weve not signed any new businessin 10 weeks,
so I hope youll understandthat this is a title only, for now.
Well, its almost an honor.
What made you suddenly write that?
Well, most of it was in the letter, hopefully,
but I think, in my heart, it was an impulse,
because I knew what I needed to doto move forward.
Well, it was a gesturewe hope will be useful.
We believe, obviously,that lung cancer is avoidable
and can be thwartedwith the right campaign.
But how?
We know frightening medical factsare useless.
-Half of us are smokers.-Im a smoker, too.
And you can forget about us.Ive worked $10 million campaigns
that cant even get people to change brands.
I can tell you from the insidethat the business
is really only about getting new smokers.
-Teenagers are a tough sell.-Not to tobacco companies.
They play on a two-pronged attack,promising adulthood and rebellion,
but teenagers are sentimental, as well.
Have you heard their music?
-I can tell you a little of what I have in mind.-I have to say, its very interesting.
Go on.
What Im suggestingis a series of commercials
that run during Bandstand and the like.
Show mothers and daughtersor fathers and sons,
and that cigarettes are between them.
And you show with a walk on the beach,baking cookies, playing catch,
that the parents are not long for this world.
But they hate their parents.
They wont be thinking about their parents.Theyll be thinking about themselves.
Thats what they do.
The truth is,
theyre mourning for their childhoodmore than theyre anticipating their future,
because they dont know it yet,but they dont want to die.
If it helps, I can guarantee youthat Lucky Strike will hate this.
-Howd it go?-So, did you get Cancer?
Megan, can you get Mr. Cosgrove?
-Weve got a meeting for another meeting.-They were eating out of his hand.
And even better, the board was loadedwith fat cats, just like you said.
Don had a particularly empathic exchangewith the CEO of Dow Chemical.
Saran Wrap would be nice.
Ill take him out on the links,let him b*at me.
Roger, this is a philanthropic organization.
Don and I think it bestif we approach from the rear.
-Are we celebrating?-Don got us to the top three.
-Stupendous.-Ken, sit down.
Everett Marlowe at Dowis a very charming fellow.
Your father-in-law to be is at Corning, right?They must be quite acquainted.
-I think thats likely.-Well, I was thinking,
wouldnt it be funto have a foursome this weekend
that includes your father-in-law,yourself and Mr. Marlowe?
Doesnt that sound like fun?
-I dont know.-Ken, theres no reason to be suddenly shy.
Im sure if you impressed Everettthis morning,
that should be enoughto get him on the phone.
Well, I just looked him in the eyeand convinced him
I was some kind of idealistic businessman.How is it gonna look if I call for a meeting?
Pretty bad, I guess.
But Im not Pete.
-Sorry about that.-No, youre obviously not.
Tom Vogel is our biggest client,unless we sign Dow, which would be yours.
Look, I love Cynthias dad,
and I know that every account I havewill eventually leave me.
-Thats awfully pessimistic.-Well, its not worth the risk.
Cynthias my life. My actual life.
Fine, if you want to tuck itbetween your legs, Ill call him,
but I have to warn you,Im going to drop your name.
You do whatever you want.
Now, if you dont mind,Im going to go service the 30% of this firm
that are my clients.
Hello, Carla. Is Sally home?
-She is, but you shouldnt be here.-Are they moving today?
Monday. Thats the Salvation Army.
Mrs. Drapers car is gone.I just wanted to say hi.
-I dont know.-Fine. I just want to say bye.
Shes upstairs. Dont be long.Mrs. Francis just ran to the store.
Thank you.
-Its Glen. Are you decent?-Come in.
You really shouldnt be here.
So, youre finally moving.
This weekend while were in Californiawith my dad.
-Jeez, is that where youre moving?-No, were moving to Rye.
Ill be able to drive in a few years.
-I can come visit.-Really?
Absolutely.
I can send you postcards.I have your address.
Its not that big a deal.I say goodbye to people all the time.
Okay. Are you going to Disneyland?
-Yes.-Get me something.
-What are you doing here?-Im sorry. its my fault.
Get out.
-What are you waiting for?-Why do you hate me?
You dont think I know what youre doing?You could be friends with anyone.
Just cause youre saddoesnt mean everybody has to be.
Im sorry. I didnt see the harm.He wanted to say goodbye.
-Did you leave them alone?-Theyre friends, thats all.
When did you decidethat youre her mother?
It was a mistake.Theres no need for that kind of talk.
You know what, Carla?
Ive been thinking, and the distance is...
I need someone new nearby,someone closer to the new house.
This should square us for the week.
Do you think I enjoy doing this?After all these years? I wont have it, Carla.
Well, someone hasto look after those children.
Really? And where are your kids?
-Are they all doctors and lawyers?-Youd best stop talking now.
-Where are you going?-Im going to say goodbye to the children.
Do you think thats a good idea right now?Itll just upset them more.
Some other time.
The bungalow in San Pedronetted you 10 grand in profit.
Whats happening with the other house?
I have a listing appointment with the realtorwhen I get back from California,
-but I have no idea what its worth.-its Ossining,
but I say youll morethan double your money,
which is not bad for 10 years.
What about the lossfor what I put into the company?
Thats an investment. its not a loss.Dont be impatient.
Enjoy the harvest. Plant some seeds.Maybe get a place of your own.
Dont you want to go home somedayand see a steak on the table?
So, Mary Sunshine,whats the capital gains? 48%?
-Mrs. Francis is on the phone. Its urgent.-You want me to go?
Its always urgent.
-Hello?-Im very sorry,
and I know this will disrupt your plans,but Im afraid I had to let Carla go today.
-What? What happened?-Don, I have the children 99% of the time.
This is a decision that I get to make.
-Well, cant I just hire her back for the trip?-No! I dont want her poisoning the well.
I told the kids shes sick.
So what the hell do I do, Betty,with no help?
I have meetings, two flights,diapers, for Christs sake.
-Then dont take them! Theyre used to it.-Were going!
Hey, Pumpernickel.Theres nobody out front.
-I already ate.-Me too,
and I ran into someone Id like you to meet.This is Carolyn Jones, like Morticia.
Peggy Olson, advertising wunderkind
-Pleased to meet you.-Do you mind?
Carolyn was at a photo sh**tmodeling pantyhose, of all things,
and she got fired and she has to make rent.
Joyce witnessed my nervous breakdownat Howard Johnsons today.
Well, hello, ladies.
Peggy, I needed to talk to youabout my ABC meeting,
but if Im interrupting...Who is this lovely young thing?
Harry, this is my friend Joyce.I thought youd already met.
Harold Crane, head of media.
-Carolyn Jones.-No kidding.
-Shes looking for work.-Thats hard to believe.
As an actress, model?What is your experience like?
Well, Ive been modeling,at least until this morning.
The Topaz people went nuts,fired the people who hired me,
-and then me.-But you didnt do anything wrong, did you?
No, she didnt.Peggy, do you think you can help?
Maybe. Im sorry.You said Topaz fired everyone?
-They were very brusque.-People lose their heads.
Im sure it was a mistake, dear.
-We should be going, honey.-Yes. Yes, of course.
Pleased to meet you.
Well see what we can do, Carolyn Jones.
-Any luck?-The hotel has a service,
but the girls who can take careof Sally and Bobby
wont watch a two-year-old and vice versa,
so Ive arranged for two girlsto cover the two mornings youre working.
I thought you might need someonefor Disneyland,
and maybe handle the Dodger gameon your own.
-Does that sound like a vacation?-Maybe itll be an adventure.
How much do you make a week?
-$70.-What if I were to double that?
Ill give you some nights free,and youll get to go to California.
Swimming pools, movie stars.
I dont really haveany professional experience.
Youll be great. Sally loved you,and Bobby likes a pretty face,
and the baby... Hes tough, but hes fun.
Ive never been to California.
I have a college friendwhos been begging me to visit.
Perfect. Call her up, pick a night,Ill foot the bill. What do you have to lose?
Please, stop the advertising.
Come on. Lets go to the room first.
Lets go,or were gonna go back to the parking lot
and spend the weekend locked in the car.
Art Garten, real name. At Topaz Pantyhose?Called me back.
He was shocked and impressedthat Id heard about them firing Dupre.
It gets better.They already bought placement
for the campaign that just fell apart,
and weve been invited in Mondayto pick up the pieces.
-I just told you that.-Mondays a holiday.
Theyre out of time. All we have to dois not throw up on our shoes.
-Do you want help?-Shes not gonna be there.
Good work.
Okay, okay, here he is.
-That was great.-its how we got Gene to sleep.
Well, lets not wake him up.
They played in the pool for four hoursand bounced on the bed for another two.
I think everybodys gonna sleep very well.
I need you to come over at 7:00 tomorrowto watch Gene.
Ill get these two breakfast on the road.
Okay.
-Good night.-Good night.
You said you didnt have any experience,and youre like Maria von Trapp.
Professionally, but I have four niecesand six nephews.
-So, how was your meeting?-Pick me up and move me to my bed.
Well, hello, there.
Stephanie, this is Sally and Bobby.
-Hello.-Hi.
Well, its very nice to meet you.How do you like California?
They love it.
The notary was supposed to be hereat 10:00, but shes late.
My mom put the papers in order,so all you have to do is sign,
and then you can go to Marineland.
Who painted on the wall?
My friend Anna. She used to live here.Stephanie is her niece.
Whos Dick?
Thats me.
Thats my nickname sometimes.
Go out back and get us some lemons.
Theyre adorable.
Is this it?
My friend Charlie is gonna help memove the piano back to my moms,
and the rest of it goes to St. Vincent de Paul.
Four boxes. Good for her.
She wanted you to have something.
Its her engagement ring from Don.
-Dont you want it?-She wanted you to have it.
You shouldnt play around with that.Besides, I dont believe in it.
-So, are you going back to school?-Not for the moment.
-What are you gonna do?-I dont know.
Thats the best part, right?Got the rest of my life ahead of me.
So do you.
Thats her.
Whos that?
-How was it?-Most of it was fun.
-Daddy, are you coming in?-Im not wearing my bathing suit.
Come in. You have to come in.
-Im gonna be a shark.-Come on, Daddy.
You swim all the time in New York.
Im really b*at.
Should I throw some herring to you two?
Dumbo, Mad Tea Party.
-And Mr. Toad.-Gene cant go on Mr. Toad.
Ill get it.
He can stay with Meganwhile we go on the ride.
Then Megan cant go.

I just wanted to make sureyou didnt need anything else.
No, I think were okay.
-Where are you going?-The Whisky a Go Go.
-Good night, everybody.-Good night. Have fun.
What about Tomorrowland?I dont want to ride an elephant.
I want to fly a jet.
Hello?
-Henry?-Im in here.
Im sorry. Everyone was late
and then it took three of themto light the pilot on the water heater.
Carla called looking for you.
-What did she want?-You know what she wanted.
You fired her and didnt tell me?
Well, Im sorry.I didnt want her invoking your sympathies.
-Why did you fire her?-Because I dont trust her judgment-
What did she say?
She said you wouldnt give hera letter of recommendation.
How long did the woman work for you?I know she doesnt steal. What did she do?
And dont tell meits just about the neighbor boy.
Sally is not allowed to see him.
-Carla said hes her friend.-"Carla said." "Carla said"?
I dont understand what youre doing.
You didnt want to move becauseyou wanted the kids to have some stability,
and then you get rid of their nannysince they were born?
I wanted a fresh start, okay?
-Im entitled to that.-There is no fresh start! Lives carry on!
Jesus, Henry,just once could you take my side?
No ones ever on your side, Betty.
Just a minute.
Am I bothering you?
No, I was out on the balconyenjoying the view.
I heard you come in and I wanted to go overthe plan for tomorrow for Disneyland.
Do you think I should be involvedin such high-level decisions?
I cant turn on the TV. Theyre asleep.
Theres nothing on TV.Come outside with me.
Its so beautiful here.
-Did you have fun with your friend?-Not really. Shes not really my friend.
We just lived together during college.My fathers a professor.
I think she liked him too much.
So, why did you see her?
I dont know.
Shes an actress now.Shes in two episodes of Hogans Heroes.
She told me I could never do itbecause of my teeth.
She actually said that to me.
I dont even want to be an actress.
I love your teeth.
I took elocution lessonswhen I moved to New York.
The teacher said I had the mouth of a singer.
-Are you sure we should do this?-Ive been thinking about you so much.
Were you thinking about thiswhen I asked you to come?
It was the first thoughtthat went through my head.
I was gonna miss you so much, anyway.
-You dont know anything about me.-But I do.
I know that you have a good heart,
and I know that youre always tryingto be better.
We all try. We dont always make it.
Ive done a lot of things.
I know who you are now.
-Its getting light outside.-I should get back before the sun comes up.
Theyre little roosters.
You should go.I dont want to confuse them.
I want to know if I can knock on this dooragain tomorrow night,
or if this is just what it is,like that night in the office.
-I need to know. I dont know why.-Because youre afraid?
You shouldnt be.
Disneyland fireworks are at 9:00.
How about dinner tomorrow nightat 11:00 right here?
Were gonna be together all day.
This is Art. Art, Ken Cosgrove and Patricia...
-What was it?-Peggy Olson.
Sit. Id offer you coffee,but everybodys gone for the holiday.
The perils of being in charge.
So, you can tell we dont have a lot of time.
I mean, not just today.Were in kind of a bind.
Were no worse than we were before,
-and I hated those people.-Do you have the old work?
Somewhere. Look, it was a gorgeous girl.
High heels, jewelry, pulling upthis Cinderella gown to show the Topaz,
but she wasnt Cinderella,and where the hell was she going?
We want something thatll stand out.I dont care if its a cartoon.
I dont care if its Abe Beame wearing them.
Were a tiny company.We need to make a stink.
Well, Ive worn them,
but what qualities, in your mind,do they have that make them unique?
Youre wearing them right now?
Yes. Because I can wear Topaz Pantyhosewith anything.
Im wearing them at work right now,
and Ill change everything but my hosebefore I go out tonight.
One pair. Thats all you need with Topaz.
If we only sold each girl one pair,wed be out of business.


"Topaz. The only pair of pantyhoseyoull ever need.
“Bad for business. Good for you."
Thats very funny,
cause it says our products so good,were not even interested in ourselves.
-Okay, thats one. What else you got?-Well, Id have to think more,
but it might be greatto show a bunch of different outfits.
One for formal, one for business,one a little sporty,
and something like"Single pair, singular comfort."
-its got the word "single" in it.-Thats two.
Daddy, tell Sallythat snakes used to have legs.
-I dont know if thats true.-You know, its true in the Bible.
We learned that they used to be fish,
and he doesnt knowbecause he has baby science.
They found a skeleton.
Where? You dont know.Youre a short stuff.
Okay, Thally.
-Shut up!-Great!
Dont be upset. its just a milkshake.
Can you grab a straw or some napkins?This is my last dress.
Im sorry. Is it late?
I wanted to let you sleep.
-How long have you been up?-A few hours.
Whats wrong?
I couldnt sleep.
I just kept thinking about you.
Im right here.
I dont know what it is about you,
but I feel like myself when Im with you,
but the way I always wanted to feel.
Because Im in love with you, Megan,and I think I have been for a while.
Don.
Oh, my goodness.
Open it.
Its beautiful.
When I saw you sleeping there, I thought...
I couldnt imaginenot seeing you there every morning.
Will you marry me?
I dont know what to say. This is all so fast.
Did you ever think of the number of thingsthat had to happen
for me to get to know you?
But everything happened,
and it got me here. What does that mean?
I cant believe this.
Yes ! Yes !
You have a ring? How longhave you been thinking about this?
Its been in my family...
Not my family, really.
It belonged to someonevery important to me.
I dont believe this. I have to call my mother.
I had this feeling,and I called her from California
-because I wanted it to go away.-I saw it on the bill.
Sorry. I have to call her.Do you want me to call her from work?
No, call her.
-What about work? What do we do?-We tell everybody.
Okay.
Do you want me to leave you alone?
-Do you want me to talk to her?-Do you speak French?
-What the hells going on?-I dont know. He wouldnt say.
Look at you, brown as a berry.
-How was the coast?-Wonderful. Joan, could you shut the door?
I have an announcement to make,
and it shouldnt change anything here,except for me, and maybe for Joan,
but Miss Calvet and I are getting married.
-Who the hells that?-Megan.
Really?
Congratulations, Don.I wish you the best of luck.
Megan out there?
Yeah, I know its a surprise,but she makes me very happy,
and, well,its something we both want very much.
Well, lets get her in here.
Megan.
-How exciting for you.-I know. I cant believe it.
Congratulations, dear.
You dont say "congratulations"to the bride. You say "best wishes."
Congratulations, Don.
Lets have a toast.Megan, could you get us some ice?
Im teasing. See, Don?This is the way to behave.
-So, when are you getting married?-I dont know. We havent discussed it.
Soon.
-Art Garten just called.-No. What did he say?
He said he liked ideas two and four,and weve got a week.
-Shall we go rub it in?-After you.
You did it.
-Weve got some great news.-Are you two getting married?
-Whats going on?-Theyre getting married.
-Really?-Congratulations!
-Thank you.-its incredible.
-I know. It just happened.-Thats incredible. You must be so happy.
Ill get it.
-We have some news, too. Peg.-Yes! We signed an account.
Topaz Pantyhose.Its a quarter of a million dollars.
-Howd you do that?-Peggy found out about them,
and then we met over the holiday.
Thats great news! We broke the streak!What a great day! Good work, both of you!
So anyway,I guess we should tell everybody.
-Topaz needs work this week.-Great.
I hope you have all the happinessthat Peggy and I had signing this account.
Ill be there in a minute.
Wow.
Its been going on a while,but I appreciate your concern.
Well, then Im happy for you. Both of you.
Shes very beautiful.
You know, she reminds me of you.Shes got the same spark.
I know she admires youjust as much as I do.
It was Dr. Miller again.
Its not gonna get any easierthe longer you wait.
Whatever could be on your mind?
-Can you believe it?-It happens all the time.
Theyre all just between marriages.You know that.
Hell probably make her a copywriter.
Hes not going to want to be marriedto his secretary.
Really? Is that what he meant?
"She admires you"? Jesus.
Thats the way it works for some.
You know, I just saved this company.
I signed the first new businesssince Lucky Strike left,
but its not as importantas getting married. Again.
Well, I was just madedirector of agency operations.
A title. No money, of course.
And if they poured champagne, it mustvebeen while I was pushing the mail cart.
A pretty face comes along,and everything goes out the window.
Well, I learned a long time agoto not get all my satisfaction from this job.
Thats bullshit.
-Faye Miller.-Hi, its me.
I was starting to worryyou were ill or something.
-I need to talk to you.-Well, I was gonna come by at lunch anyway.
No, you shouldnt do that.Why dont we meet somewhere?
What is going on?
Something happened, and Id liketo talk to you about it face to face.
-Meet me for coffee.-Okay.
You know what?
Im not gonna have some conversationand have to sit through coffee afterwards.
Just get to it.
Well,
H
met somebody.
-And were engaged.-Are you kidding me?
I know, I know. its a surprise.It was for me too.
Jesus.
Who is she?
Whats the difference? I fell in love.
I didnt mean for this to happen.Youve been very important to me.
So youre not gonna put an adin the New York Times
saying you never liked me?
-Faye.-Well, I hope youre very happy,
and I hope she knowsyou only like the beginnings of things.
Im sorry.
-I dont know what else to say.-Goodbye.
I saw the light go off.
Its fine. Its done.
I love you, you know.
And hes smiling like a fool,
like hes the first manthat ever married his secretary.
Shes 25. As if thats news.
So, when are you gonnatell them your news?
Theyll know soon enough.
Are you showing at all?The picture I have of you doesnt change.
-Ill take a new one and Ill send it to you.-You know all I want to know.
Yes, honey, theyre bigger.
Why are you torturing me? I just woke upand its already 90 degrees here.
Listen, Ive gotta go.
-Not yet.-What?
-Not yet!-You listen to the doctor.
You have to eat.Dont worry about your figure.
Ill whip you and the baby into shapewhen I get back.
Okay.
Ill call you Thursday night, your time.
-Okay. I love you.-I love you, too.
Hello?
-Mrs. Truxton?-No, its me.
-What are you doing here?-its Tuesday at 7:00.

with the real estate agent.
I didnt realize that was today.I forgot about the cabinets in the guest bath.
-So you werent that thorough?-I guess not.
-Do you like the new house?-I do. its got a lot of character.
Ill probably have to tear out the kitchen.
Remember this place?
I do.
-its different. Thats for certain.-isnt that what you wanted?
I dont know, Don.
Things arent perfect.
So youll move again.
So much change. its made everything

Really?
-Bethany Van Nuys?-No. Someone at work.
Im very happy for you.
Its okay, Betty.
I dont know why Im surprised.

Yes.
So, I will see you the weekend after next.
-What is that, the 23rd?-I think so.
Wait.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
