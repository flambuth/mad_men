You sound terrible.
You even look terrible.
You dont.
Im going to stand over here.
Fine, if you think youll be safeover there by yourself.
Going up.
So am I. Thank you.
My God, Don!
My bad penny.
Andrea, this is my wife, Megan.
Megan, this is Andrea.
Shes a freelance writer from the old firm.
- Nice to meet you.- Yes, you as well.
Well, goodbye.
It was nice meeting you.
- Look...- You look.
How many times is this going to happen?
What? I worked with her six years ago.
Were in Midtown.Im going to run into people.
You know, there are some parts of town
where we canrun into some people I worked with.
AII they care aboutis that theyre see-through.
Why is transparencydesirable in pantyhose?
I can see fine.
You want to get in here with me?
- Hello, Pegasus.- Hey, you.
- You have to let me announce you.- Go ahead.
Hello, Stanley, Ginso.
I have amazing photos.
Crime scene snaps fromChicagos student nurse m*ssacre.
- Not suitable for publication.- What?
Oh, my God!
Im telling you, youre upset over nothing.
- Youre making it worse. Ill get over it.- Megan.
Im fine.
You should be.
- They look like rag dolls.- Were they r*ped?
They dont know,but a couple of these are naked.
It went on for hours.
- The rest just waited.- They were tied up.
Im sorry Im late.
Megan. Ive got some pictures.
Ginsberg, you got to see these.
Ill see you later.
And Ill see you later.
The sex m*rder in Chicago.The student nurses.
- Really?- Take it.
- Oh, my God!- Look at the bottom row.
I think this is going to make the cover,not the riots.
Really?
Yeah, we did the riots this week.Watts a year later.
Plus, there have been five riotsthis summer.
I say its better than even moneyMr. Luce finds a tasteful way to do this.
You know what? Put it away. Its disgusting.
Its one of those thingsI wish I didnt see.
And why are you laughing?
- Were not laughing.- No, youre excited by it.
Some girl trussed up like a cut of meat?
Eight girls, but nine were kidnapped.
One survived.
I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
How did she do that?
She hid under the bed. He lost count.
You know what?
Youre sickos.
Michael.
Hes right.
Its been 25 minutes. Its not even set.
I told you the jets are clogged.
Give me some money. Ill go to the bakery.
And we need to get beer.Greg likes Schaefer. Do we have time?
Not if you want me toget the baby out of here by noon.
Why? Hes going to wantto see Kevin more than me.
Thats what hes going to say,but hes going to want you right away.
Let me go get my purse.Youre making me very anxious right now.
Its okay to be anxious. Its normal.
Everythings going to beunfamiliar for both of you.
And who knows what hes seen?Who knows what hes done?
Hes a surgeon. He wasnt in combat.
He saw the same things there he saw here.
Well, there are other things that happenwhen men are away, especially at w*r.
Stop it.
Stop talking about men in general,when I know its all about Daddy.
Even if there havent been other women,hes not used to listening to a woman.
Its just the idea of coming homeand finding a little hole in his life
and sticking his elbow throughuntil he can walk all the way in.
I know.
And thats why I want to startwith him seeing his son for the first time.
Hell know how to do that.
Youre right.
Do you really want a cake?
Because its going to take me a whileto get dressed.
Could you?
Your daughters on line one.
Hello, sweetheart. Whats the matter?
Grandma Pauline is still hereand I hate her.
Stay out of her way.
Your mother will be back Friday morning.
It is Friday morning.
Someone called on Henrys phone and saidthat they couldnt get an airplane flight,
so someones driving them backfrom Buffalo tonight.
Youd think Henry could get a flight.
I know. Hes so important.
They call Bobby all the timein sleepaway camp.
I guess if I was peeing in my pants,they might want to say hi.
Thats not nice.
Grandma Pauline wears so much perfume.
Every time she comes near me,I want to barf.
And you know what else?
She doesnt believe me,
that Im allowed to watch as much TVas I want because its the summer.
Your mother lets you do that?
Im on vacation.
I think the best thing is for you togo out in the fresh air and get some sun.
I did. Its really hot.
Stop complaining. I dont want youto get rickets in that haunted mansion.
Ill see you next weekend.
How are you?
I have a cold,but youve made me feel better.
Cant you come get me?
No. And dont ask again.
- Okay, bye.- Bye.
Are you sick?
Im great. Lets go.
So, it starts with Ken Cosgrove climbingout of the muck and walking on dry land.
He says a bunch of nice stuffabout Ginsberg and you.
I told him not to use the word "genius"about either of us.
A woman and her secrets.
The things shell never tell,
like how long it took her to get readyor the reason shes smiling.
A good-looking woman at a party.
And where she got those incredible shoes.
Another woman, not too catty, says,
"I love your shoes.Where did you get them?"
We hold on five seconds of hershowing off the shoe from the calf down,
and this girls legs will be spectacular.And, yes, you can come to casting.
Thats plenty.
Are you kidding? Im ready to take off here.
I just wanted to hear the tone of your voice
so I can make sure its not as annoyingas it is in everyday life.
Its called a regional accent.And believe it or not, youve got one, too.
We cant all sound like Walter Cronkite.
Do you like this?I never saw boards for the Cinderella thing.
Well, you k*ll it, and for good reason.Cinderella and shoes is a clich√©.
You could have TB.
Sleeping Beauty? Snow White?Nothing worked?
Theyre more about necrophilia than shoes.
Its footwear. Dont make that mistake.
- Oh, my God! Youre so skinny.- So are you.
Somebody wants to say hello.
Jesus, is that him?
Holy crap, look at him!
Joanie, Ill get that.
You have your hands full.
We thought your flight might be latebecause of the strike.
Yeah, we picked up some folks in Honoluluwho had been stranded,
but everything was fine.
Gail, go get the Brownie.
I dont think we have any film.
You know what?
Ill take Kevin and go get some,so you two can visit a spell.
Okay, thats a good idea.
You have supplies in caseyou have to be gone for a while?
I have everything.
And so do you, Greg.
Get over here.
Where have you been?
Out in the wilderness, baby.
- What are you doing?- Looking for Aspirin.
- Why dont you have Dawn do it?- Im embarrassed.
Ive eaten up a bottlesince shes been here.
My husbands an Aspirin addict.Im so ashamed.
Youre very warm. Im sending you home.
Im sorry about this morning.
It couldnt be avoided.
It was a long time ago and I was unhappy.
Because you were married.
Its fine. Its just embarrassing.
Why should you be embarrassed?
Seriously?
Because youre married to me now.
And after Allison and Faye Millerand who knows how many more...
I was divorced.
And now youre not.
And that kind of careless appetite,
you cant blame that on Betty.
I tell you, let it go.
You brought it up.
No, I didnt.
You did.
And all I can think is you feel guilty,which makes it worse than I thought.
I married you.
And Im going to be with you until I die...
Which could be this afternoon.
Is this really how you want to spendmy last hours on Earth?
Sweetie, go home.
I have to go to this meetingso I can skip the next two.
At least go lie down.
Eat your sandwich.
Im not hungry.
My Lord!
- Those poor souls.- What?
Nothing.
Some things are not for children.
Mommy lets me watch the news.
You demanded tuna salad,so youre going to sit there until you eat it.
It has relish in it.
You havent even tasted it.
You hurt my hand.
Well, I shouldnt have done that. Im sorry.
But you have to be respectful.I know your mother has other rules.
- She doesnt have rules.- I dont believe that,
but I believe that she may be distracted.
And I am sure she would be sickif she knew how you were behaving.
Now youre going to finish that sandwich,crusts and all.
I dont care if it takes all day.
Howd you sleep?
Very well, thank you.
What are you doing?
Hes making lunch. He wont listen.
Greg, honey, I have steak.Mom bought a cake.
Believe it or not, I had steak in Vietnam.
I did not have bologna.
And Ill have veal tonight with my folks.
What are the three of you up to?
Im showing Kevinhow good I am with my hands.
We were talking about the riots.
Plenty of Negroes in Saigonand theyre plenty brave.
I think we should have a rule that
you have to wear your uniformall the time when youre home.
Gail, is there a chanceyou could pick up more beer?
Of course.
I wanted to get the afternoon paper anyway.
Thank you so much, Mom.
Well be back in time for dinner.
You look incredible, you know?
Thank you.
I need to tell you something.
Greg, if something happened over there andyou feel the need to tell me, you shouldnt.
And if you do, you certainly shouldntask me to hold your hand.
What? No.
No, its not that.
Listen, Joanie,theres been a change of plans.
I have to go back.
- I know, for another 40 days.- No,
for a year.
What?
It was one year here and one year there.Thats what they told you.
Look, I know youre hearing a lot of horriblethings about whats going on over there.
It couldnt be further from the truth.You dont need to worry.
You did your part. Theyre a bunch of liars.
Nobody lied to anybody.
Its more complicated. Its w*r.
It doesnt stop for our plans.And Ive come to terms with that.
Now we have 10 days together.Lets not waste it.
I need to store upas much of you as possible.
And, yes, you can come to casting.
And you think it sounds good,wait till you see it in print.
"Youll never tell.Theyll never be able to."
I dont know. What do you think, Mr. Butler?
I think Ken was right. Youre a genius.
Square-on strategy.
I think the boys did a good job.
The girl should be European-looking.
Maybe get a French girl.
Great.
So?
Sold.
I have to tell you, young man,you really know women.
Ive never heard that before.
This really gets inside their heads.
Well, to tell you the truth,they confuse me.
I mean, I keep thinking about Cinderella.
We were going to come in here andtalk about Cinderella, but its too dark.
Really?
We were kind of hoping for it.
Nah, I dont think so.
I mean, shes running downthis dark side street.
And its outside a castle, soits got those walls and the cobblestones.
And shes running, but shes only got thisone incredible shoe for her incredible gown,
so shes hobbling, wounded prey.
She can hear him behind her,his measured footsteps catching up.
She turns a corner.
Those big shadows.
And shes scared.
And then she feels a hand on her shoulderand she turns around.
And it doesnt matter what he looks like,
hes handsome at that momentoffering her her shoe.
She takes it.
She knows shes not safe,but she doesnt care.
I guess we know in the end
she wants to be caught.
See? Its too dark.
Why dont we do that?
The man said sold.
You wanted Cinderella anyway.You forgot that.
No, I said it was a clich√©.
Thats because you thoughtthey wouldnt like it,
but in your heart, you knew it was good.
In my heart, Im on the vergeof throwing you in front of a cab.
Okay.
So however proud of yourselfyoure feeling right now,
just know that everything Im sayinghas "or else" after it.
Dont do that again.
Think of those ideas in front of me.
Dont do that again.
I gotta make a call.
Hes such a decent guy.
You know you almost got fired just now.
I dont think youre right about that.
Im positive.
Mr. Draper is on line one.
Hello. Howd it go?
Good. What are you up to?
Im keeping your chair warm.
So Ill swing by and get you in an hour?
Well, why dont you just go home,climb into bed?
- Really?- Yes.
I only need another couple of hours.
And, Don,
no smoking.
Mohawk says that L.B.J. is scaredof forcing the mechanics to arbitration
because he has midterm elections andhes worried about losing the labor vote.
- Thats good news.- Yes, it is.
The strikes going to go onfor at least a couple more weeks
and Mohawk can sop up all the extra routes.
So, they want us to walk them throughthe campaign first thing Monday morning.
A phone call will do.
The campaign, of course.
Were ready to go.
Have a good weekend.
Damn it.
- Good night, everyone, Clara.- Good night, Mr. Campbell.
Wheres Ginsberg?
Hes probably everywhereafter Don scattered his ashes.
Apparently he went haywirein the presentation downstairs.
I dont care. Call him.
I just did. Hes not home.
Is he coming back?
You know what?Im going to go out there and find him.
Im going to start with the whole world
and then Im going toeventually check my apartment.
What are you doing tonight?
I dont know. What did you have in mind?
Are you drunk? Get your feet off that desk.
I need you to work up somethingfor Mohawk.
Oh, Im sorry.For Mohawk, your "man" is Ginsberg.
Lets say you were to do this for me,
and on Monday you explain toGinsberg and Campbell that I asked you to...
Only I asked you sometime last week.
Do you have a brief?
Did Ginsberg have a brief?
I never told Ginsberg, okay?You have to remember that.
You know about the airline strike, right?
Yes. Why is Mohawk still flying?
Because even thoughall the other mechanics are on strike...
They need more wrenches or something.
...Mohawks mechanics have a side deal,so they have to keep working.
They must love that.
Yeah, well,theyre going to love the overtime.
American Airlines is taking everything big
and giving their northeast corridorto Mohawk.
So what do you want?
How about something like, "Mohawk,breaking the strike one flight at a time"?
Or maybe,"Fly over the picket line with Mohawk"?
Hey, Trotsky, youre in advertising.
Fine. So whats the angle?
Campbell or I had this idea thatit would be something about,
you know, how times are toughand you cant get anywhere.
So thank God,Mohawk is offering emergency service.
You dont want to use the word "emergency"with an airplane.
I dont want to do any of this.Ill see you Monday.
Hold on a second.
You want me to work upan entire corporate image campaign for $10?
I can make you do it for nothing.Im the boss.
Youre right.The work is $10, the lie is extra.
Incredible.What do you make a week, sweetheart?
You dont know, huh? Thats helpful.
You know, I could fire you.
Great. There are some portfoliosin Joans office.
Maybe you could find somebody tonight.
Why are you doing this to me?
Because youre being very demandingfor someone who has no other choice.
Dazzle me.
Fine.
How much you want?
How much you got?
- $400.- Give me all of it.
Jesus!
It better be good.
Do you want me to take your watch?
Im on my way out. Are you staying?
Hello. Good night.
Yeah. Something came up.Would you tell Patricia she can go home?
Okay.
Get in here.
- What are you doing here?- We didnt get to talk.
Weve done all the talkingwere ever going to do.
Are you okay?
How the hell did you get in here?
I have a way with doormen.
I have some bad news for you.
You can either take the stepsor you can go off the balcony,
because if you run into my wife on the wayout of here, youre going to wish you had.
Forceful.
My, oh, my!
Everybody probably thinks that she did this,but I know it was you.
You really should go. I gotta lie down.
Ill take the steps.
You know what, take the service elevator.
Goodbye. Im sorry.Youve gotta understand.
Are you okay?
Please, you have to go.
It was just sex. It doesnt mean anything.
Im sorry. Ive gotta lie down.
Hes here! My mystery date...
The girl under the bed...
Id be surprised if she could ever talk again.
That poor thing, paralyzed with fear
while he opened that door eight times,
and dragged another one out.
And that...
No, as much as Id love to go, I cant makeany plans until they waltz through that door.
You need to take out the trash.
Right now?
Take out the trashor you can go to bed right now,
watch the sun setfrom your bedroom window.
Its the saddest thing in the world.


If I take out the trash,will you tell me about the m*rder?
No. I will not bargain with you.
How old are you?
Thats something we girls keep to ourselves.
Was your mom strict?
No, but my father wasand Im a better person for it.
I know you dont think so,but Im a good person.
Sally, I just think someone in your worldneeds to discipline you
so you can start acting like an adult.
My father.
I remember one time he was sleeping on thecouch in the living room and I walked by.
And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
he kicked me so hard that I actually flewacross the room and hit a piece of furniture.
And then he looked at me and he said,"Thats for nothing, so look out."
Thats not very nice.
No,
but it was valuable advice.
When in doubt,go with the most expensive, right, Pops?
I dont want any wine.
Okay, can we all cheer up, please?
Were together, I have a new baby boy,not to mention this place costs a fortune.
So how are we starting? The lovely signora?
Ill have a gin fizz.
Everybody else is having wine,but you have to give me a second.
- How are you doing?- Cant complain.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you. You, too, sir.
First armored division, Fort Hood.
Do you want me to come back?
No, but you can recommend something.
Are you in a rush?
No, its just that Igot a bunch of tables.
Well, Im sorry if that littledisplay of respect is slowing you down,
but a lot of kids your age would be thrilledto be waiting tables tonight.
Im sorry, sir. Of course.
This is a nice one.
Thank you. Thatd be perfect.
The scampi looks very good.
- Im sorry, this is a painful charade.- Mom, please.
I just dont understand it.Everyone else is trying to come home.
Ruth, Greg is facing this with great bravery
and Im proud of him.
He did his time.Youve got to talk him out of it.
Mom, I dont want your grandsonhearing this argument.
Joe, you were in the service.
Cant you write a letter to your congressmanand tell him hes got a family?
Why? Is some congressmangoing to talk him out of going back?
I dont understand.
Im putting a moratoriumon this conversation.
Now we are either going to have this dinnerthat Ive been dreaming about for months,
or we can all go home.
He didnt tell you about it.
Of course not.
What is she talking about?
Did you have a say in this?
Youre a father now.
- What?- Joanie, calm down.
You volunteered?
They need me.
You know, Joanie plays the accordion.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
What are you doing?
I fell asleep.
Well, its time to go home.
I will, in a bit.
Come on, I dont want to walk out alone.
I dont know. I think Ill just stay here.
You can hop in a cab.
I happen to have a lot of cash for once.
Even if a cab was going to take me, theyrenot going to take me past 96th Street.
Really?
Well, then, take the subway.
My brother wont let me.
You know, with everythingthats happening in Chicago.
Well, youre not a nurse.
Right.
Is there a riot in Harlem?
There was a thing in Bed-Stuy.
Theres a lot of police.
Well, I know that doesnt make it safer.
My boyfriends in Chicago.Hes covering the riots.
Is that right?
Why dont you stay with me tonight?
Ive stayed here before. Ill be fine.
Get your things.
Are you asleep?
Youre home.
Youre mumbling.
How the hell did you get in here?
I was worried about you.
You left the back door unlocked.
- Why cant you leave me alone?- I cant.
You have to.
Were alone.
I just want it fast.
No.
I know shes coming home.
Ill be gone. I promise.
Andrea.
I can feel you against me.
Remember that night at Lincoln Center whenyou took me back to the loading dock?
Your wife was waiting inside.
So its just me, my brother, whos 19,and my mother, who says shes 39.
Like Jack Benny.
Is your brother in school?
No, he delivers furniture and argueswith my mother about joining the Army.
You were saying something in the taxiabout Don and I cut you off.
No, I was finished.
You can talk to me.
I was his secretary, you know?
You were?
- So how did you...- I didnt even ask for it.
Sometimes they drag the secretaries infor focus groups to try things
and I was discovered,
like Esther Blodgett.
Oh, God! Im really drunk.
Yall drink a lot.
So what were you going to say?
I was going to say...
Go ahead. You can talk.
- Im trying to.- Im sorry.
I was going to say I hope you wonttell Mr. Draper about me sleeping there.
You two talk sometimes.
Nah.
We have to stick together.
I know were not reallyin the same situation,
but I was the only one like me therefor a long time.
I know its hard.
I appreciate that.
Do you want to be a copywriter?
No. I like my job.
Yep.
Youre right.
Copywriters tough,
especially for a woman.
Do you think I act like a man?
I guess you have to a little.
I try, but...
I dont know if I have it in me.
I dont know if I want to.
Im sorry. I cant sleep.
Well, you cannot sneak up onsomeone my age, especially in this house.
Im scared.
Can I sit with you?
Only for a bit.
Whats that for?
Why are you scared?
I read the newspaper.
Honey. Did you pull it out of the trash?
Why did that man do that?
Well, probably because he hates his mother.
- I dont understand what happened.- What happened?
Those girls got ready for bed,
and there was a knock on the door,and a handsome man was there.
And maybe one of them knew him,but probably not.
Because he was probably justwatching them from afar.
AII those young, innocent nurses
in their short uniforms stirring his desire.
For what?
What do you think?Youre old enough to know.
Why didnt they run away?
Because they were scared.
They probably thought,"He cant r*pe nine of us."
Why not?
You just cant.
They didnt knowit was going to be worse than that.
They didnt knowwhat was in store for them.
Now Im really scared.
Its not going to happen,
not while Ive got my burglar alarm.
How am I going to sleep?
Get the water.
Whats that?
Its Seconal.
Do you know how to take a pill?
You two stop it.
Damn it, Joanie!
- Stop it.- Gail, out!
Take him out of here!
Open this door or I will kick it down!
Who goes back?
I will throw a parade for you every dayto thank you for preserving freedom.
Its done.
Well, you cant makea decision like that without me
and you have never understood that.
If this was World w*r IIand the Japs were still attacking us,
youd say, "Yes, of course!"
Soldiers wanted to come homefrom World w*r II also!
Ive got my orders, youve got yours.
- Where are you going?- To meet the boys for a drink.
He just needs to blow off steam.
Dont get involved, Mother.
Youre a military wife. You make sacrifices.
Someones Kevin is over there and hesgoing to get hurt and Greg wont be there.
But our Kevin is right in thereand he doesnt care.
Its a year. You can do it. Ill help.
No.
Go lie down.You dont even know how tired you are.
I hope you dont mind the couch.
Since my roommate moved, the otherroom has just a pile ofAbes clothes.
This is perfect.
Well, goodnight, then.
Ill just throw these out.
Thanks.
Goodnight.
Ill see you later.
No, you wont.
Dont argue with me.
I have to get out of here.
Hotel next time?
No next time. That was a mistake.
A mistake you love making.
Id better not see you again.
Youre not going to ruin this.
You loved it.
And youll love it againbecause you are a sick, sick...
Hello? Were home.
Ma.
Ma!
Whats going on?
Wheres Sally?
Sally?
How are you feeling?
Where were you?
I was right there.
Youre burning up.
No, last night.
I was waiting for you.
I came right home.
You were a mess. I was really worried.
You dont have to worry about me.
Okay.
There are some scrambled eggs in the bowland I made flapjacks.
Just coffee.
Wheres Kevin?
You slept a long time.He was awake and went back to bed already.
I barely slept at all.
Ive been thinking about it and...
I want you to go.
Ill put this away.
Im glad you came around. Its only a year.
No.
I want you to go and never come back.
Damn it, Joanie. They need me.
Well, then, it works out, because we dont.
Im very important there.
I have 20 docs and medics who rely on me.They look to me for my k*ll and leadership.
Im glad the Army makes you feel like a man,
because Im sick of trying to do it.
The Army makes me feel like a good man.
Youre not a good man.
You never were,
even before we were married,and you know what Im talking about.
If I walk out that door, thats it.
Thats it.
Its over.
