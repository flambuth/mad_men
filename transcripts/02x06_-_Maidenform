Youre asking if Ive seen these before?
Theyve been running this for ten years.
The Playtex people are jealous.
They shouldnt be.
Maidenform is a dream, but Playtex is a bra.
Ive never seen either brand go wrong.
I had four of these up in my dorm.
I didnt even know what advertising was.
Why now? Sales are strong.
Someone has a wife with an opinion.
They would like to do what Maidenform is doing,
not what were doing.
Why? Then they both have the same campaign.
I love how they dont need a diagram.
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?
And if so, why?
I do,
and I agree with the 95 women we surveyed
about how well it fits.
I find they both open easily.
I like a happy client,
although youd think someone would be able
to talk them out of jumping onto a bandwagon
- as solid as this. - Maybe they want us to raise the bar.
Why, because their share of the market keeps increasing?
You see them every four months.
Why not throw them a bone?
Let them see theyre paying for creative.
Just wrinkle it a little.
I went to sleep in my bra,
and I thought I was so-and-so.
Thank you for that.
Just for fun, lets say were looking for new,
and by new I mean old Maidenform.
Peggy, you dig in around Playtexs unique benefits.
Just the man to do it.
What do I tell them?
Tell them you couldnt get a hold of me.
Mr. Phillips, your ex...
your wife...
Mrs. Phillips...
Pauline. I see her.
Thank you, Joyce.
Hey, fella.
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.
Someone made you smell like a girl, yes.
Come on. This way.
Hey, slugger.
Hey, Dad.
- Precious. - Hi, Daddy.
- You look well. - So do you.
Hows your mother?
Worse. Shes very erratic.
Did you see the guy up at Brigham
that Bob Levinson recommended?
I dont want to talk about this right now.
I cant leave right now.
I wish you would have told me
that you were going to be early.
Well, I know youre not good in the afternoons.
Thats not true anymore. You know that.
Okay.
You two have a good time.
I will try and call you from Nanas.
Did you get a suite?
They opened up the room next door.
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.
Cause hes a good boy. Yeah.
Were going to have a wonderful time on the town.
I got tickets for A Funny Thing Happened.
We saw it.
Not from these seats.
I should go.
So, youll have to wait a little while in my office,
do your studies, work up an appetite.
Its Memorial Day.
All I have is German vocabulary.
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.
Nice dog.
Who are these?
This is my son Mark and my daughter Patricia.
A handsome family.
And this is Chauncey.
I hope he cant smell cat on me.
Freddie and I work together.
Can I bend your ear a minute?
Spit it out, Freddie.
Were going to need another box of brassieres.
Yes. Of course.
Enjoy your holiday.
Come on, Chauncey.
Her skin cleared up, but she still looks unhappy.
Shes a cheerleader.
For who, the University of Dour?
Does she have any cute friends?
These are the top three.
Im sorry, but compared to the kids on American Bandstand,
they look miserable.
Those kids are drunk.
Really?
I dont know.
What about the idea of them going on a date?
Mr. And Mrs. Fresh Face.
We could do multiple panels in print,
but it would really translate to TV.
How?
Like a contest?
No, its a story.
Anticipation as they get ready,
fixing their hair to look perfect.
Their skin, its not even on their mind.
Theyre two kids who used to have a problem.
Thanks, Clearasil.
Maybe, but its prom night,
and it ends with him at the door and her and a corsage,
the first moment they see each other.
And Dad with the Brownie?
Clearasil...
and some kind of line.
What about "Thanks, Clearasil"?
I need to think about it.
I can work with that.
You want to run this by your father-in-law?
Eventually.
Have a nice holiday.
So how the hell are you, Don?
Good. How are you, Crab?
Glad to be in shorts.
You dont play?
I dont mind watching.
Whenever its this hot,
I think about that summer they executed the Rosenbergs.
It was always about to rain.
I remember that.
We were still in Manhattan.
- I dont miss it. - Yep.
We get them to close Sing Sing, well be in Shangri-la.
I keep having this dream
that theres a power failure and the gates open.
Hadnt thought of that.
Lets change the subject.
Eventually, I just said, "Fine.
"If Lem Jones Associates is falling apart, maybe its time to move on."
I hadnt heard about that.
I guess you PR men have the best PR.
Yeah, I went to Rogers & Cowan and left it burning behind me.
What happened over there?
I was on the team that took the fall for the Cuban Revolutionary Council.
The Bay of Pigs?
The CIA hired us to help inspire the Cuban people
to a coordinated wave of sabotage and rebellion.
You handled that?
Not as badly as they did.
But I dont know when Dons going to be able to get away.
High-class problems, my dear.
Marcie, we should say hello to Chuck and Ann.
I didnt know you belonged here.
Ive been coming here since I was a kid.
Were guests of the Pattersons.
Wheres Tara?
Over there, I think.
I havent seen you riding.
I suppose thats true.
I know you changed your schedule,
and Im afraid I had something to do with that.
No. Dont be ridiculous.
All I wanted to say is please ride when you want.
Ill stay out of your way.
Its very nice to see you.
Arthur, its okay.
As we used to say in college, lets be friends.
Good. Because I think you would have enjoyed
seeing me get nosed into the trough the other day.
No.
Yes.
Mommy! Mommy!
Well, its nice to see you.
You as well.
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.
Still, all that vigor disappeared
when he found out he couldnt get anything done.
Its Versailles.
Jackies smiling all over the world.
Hes chasing starlets.
Everybodys happy.
Im building a b*mb shelter.
Really?
If you see Petra, dont mention it.
She doesnt want people to know.
Good seeing you, Don.
Let me know if you need a reference.
Wed love to have you here.
If I could have everyones attention for a moment.
Please be seated.
It is a tradition
that we have our ribs and fashion show on this day every year.
Well, this is not to dim our resolute admiration
for the fortitude of those who have so nobly served our country,
many of whom will not be enjoying ribs this afternoon.
If you could please stand, all servicemen,
for a moment of our insufficient appreciation.
Including Lester Aaron.
Lester was a Rough Rider.
Please, heroes, on your feet.
Can you close the door?
Youre letting the air out.
Those look delicious.
Its not the club,
but at least you know I washed my hands.
How are things in the circus?
Damn serious.
What is this?
J&B.
The network sent me a case.
This is why I dont have a TV.
You want something else?
Hell suffer through it.
Do you know where youre summering?
We were thinking Point OWoods.
I have to work, though.
Mothers going to expect you on Fishers.
I see her crossing the widows walk with an eye to the sea.
Peter.
I was on the phone with her the other day,
and you were all she talked about.
- Really? - No. Im kidding.
I dont think I know whats funny about that.
Judy, would you help me with the corn?
Now, listen. Dont scrimp.
Take a vacation.
Dont Trudys folks have some incredible vacation spread?
Its not about the money, Bud.
Im very important to the agency.
My absence is felt.
Yes. Well.
Lets see how the Ottomanelli Brothers treated us.
And heres Annette Fogel ready for the playa.
Thats Spanish for beach, gentlemen,
and thats where youll want to be.
If something sportier is what youre looking for,
- check out... - I have to go.
...last years singles champion.
Really? Youre really going?
I wouldnt think youd want to leave this.
People will be working. I should stop by.
Okay.
Youre going to miss the sparklers.
Call me from the emergency room.
Oh, and this delight, Judy Sawyer,
is ready for the beaches of California,
where she loves to do the Watusi.
Room 301.
Hello.
Youre there. Good.
Yes.
But theres been a change of plans.
Im spending the day with my son.
Were going to the beach.
Your son?
Hes 18.
I dont know why I never brought him up.
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills for the next ten days.
Los Angeles. Thats far away.
No. Its some club in Kentucky.
Still far away.
I could stay out at the beach, and you could join.
You never saw it.
Dont do that.
What? You never think about it?
No.
I do. All the time.
The car on its side, your body crushing me.
I dont know why I think about it.
Maybe I do.
Ill call you.
Id like that.
Morning.
Hello.
I ran that "Thanks, Clearasil" thing by my father-in-law.
He loved it.
Im glad.
The libraries were closed yesterday.
What did you do?
I was working,
and then there was a barbecue.
It was too hot.
It was too hot.
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.
It goes along for a while,
and then it takes a turn
and ends up exactly where you thought it was going.
John Wayne sh*t him.
Have you seen it yet?
Its okay. You saved me 50 cents.
Im sorry. I hate people who do that.
I know you dont like the line.
Look, its all about keeping your father-in-law happy.
I do my job, you do yours.
Whats that supposed to mean?
Nothing.
Just play with it.
Okay?
So youre still out there in Brooklyn?
Yes.
Where again?
Marine Park?
No, I moved a while ago.
Im on my second apartment, in Prospect Park.
East 83rd Street.
Its a ghost town.
But my brother came to my cookout.
Who were you with?
My family.
Pete, look, I really do have a lot of work to do.
Of course.
Let me know where you land.
How was your day off?
Restful.
I went to the beach.
Too much, I see.
I got it behind my knees.
I couldnt sit down.
Morning.
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.
Has your wife seen that yet?
Do me a favor. Let me be there when it happens.
Is that why youre here?
Concerned for my well-being?
Heres your cigarette. Be on your way.
But wait. Theres more.
You are going to have lunch with Duck.
Perhaps on a train car,
because I want you to sign an armistice on American Airlines.
What are you talking about?
Ive been in the meetings.
Errol Flynn is gone, and so is my taste for swordplay.
You two need to put them away.
I have.
Ive been married for over 20 years.
I know the difference between a spat and spending a month on the couch.
Dont go to bed angry.
Two hot chocolates.
I dont want it.
Sure you do.
Its good when its hot to drink something hot.
If you continued with the Scouts, you would have learned that.
Patty, you can use the phone, but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.
Daddy has a morning meeting.
Theres a food cart. Itll be here in 20 minutes.
No scraps for Chauncey.
I have money. I have $150.
Mark.
Thats good.
How did you get that tidy sum?
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.
And why would he do that?
Because he wants us to be happy when he marries Mom.
We all want you to be happy.
And whatever his intentions, its very generous.
He already asked her.
Well.
You must have known eventually
that your mother and I might be starting new lives.
We understand. We dont care.
Its not easy for her.
With you away at St. Pauls now, shes lost her man of the house.
Franklin Reeve is a good man.
Moms going to stick you with Chauncey.
What?
Were supposed to say good-bye to him.
She cant make you do that.
Dad, hes your dog.
And Ive learned to live without him
so you two kids could have some consistency.
Franks allergic.
Your mother will be here in a half an hour.
Where are we?
We had an interesting idea.
We?
Are you on Playtex?
He wants to get credit for his idea.
You sure about that?
Well, we went out the other night, after the meeting...
you know, a little extra hours after hours...
and I looked around the bar.
We all did.
From what I understand,
Playtex has an amazing bra, but it doesnt take you anywhere.
Well put.
So I was thinking.
Women right now already have a fantasy,
and its not going up the Nile.
Its right here in America.
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.
Every single woman is one of them.
Watch this.
Jackie.
Marilyn.
Jackie.
Marilyn...
Well, Marilyns really a Joan, not the other way around.
That is an idea and an impressive presentation.
Well, you always say its a 24-hour-a-day job.
Apparently, Ive already signed off on it.
I dont know if all women are a Jackie or a Marilyn.
Maybe men see them that way.
Bras are for men.
Women want to see themselves the way men see them.
Youre a Jackie or a Marilyn...
a line and a curve.
Nothing goes better together.
Which do you think I am?
Gertrude Stein.
I would say youre more classical,
Hellenic.
Irene Dunne.
I love Irene Dunne.
Peggy, youre going to have company on this.
Congratulations, Kinsey.
You forced your way onto an account.
Mr. Phillips is here.
Sorry Im late.
Get back. Out.
Whos the new account man?
Its Chauncey. Sorry about that.
Listen, any idea when I can schedule Playtex?
Were laying track.
I think you can bring the train in tomorrow.
Something new, I hope.
Can I drop some crumbs, at least?
Two sides of one woman...
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.
Maybe its two girls.
But definitely two flavors...
vanilla and cherry.
Sounds good.
Don, your girl says youre free for lunch.
Shes in charge.
Come on, Chauncey.
Come on.
Thought you all were listening. Lets go.
Freddie.
What, sweetheart?
I wish you would have told me you were going to work Tuesday night.
If you have something better,
Ill run it by Don.
He already likes that.
Yes, he does.
Isnt that our goal?
Im not saying I had a better idea,
but now Im not even a part of it.
All I had to do was be in that bar.
Believe me, you didnt want to be in that bar.
The works done.
Now go write me some titillating copy.
Mr. Draper is here to see you.
Send him in.
Are you coming by to pick me up?
No.
Its just I wasnt really planning on coming back after lunch.
Any way we can have this conversation now?
Conversation?
Roger told me it was just a friendly lunch.
I know.
People start giving you things.
They think its cute.
Ive got a crate of that crap somewhere.
Thats quite a playing field you have there.
I dont like anything on it but ashes.
I thought maybe your secretary was better than mine.
Nobodys secretarys better than yours.
You creative directors.
All I can say is its been hard to figure things out around here.
Eighteen months in?
We cant be that unusual.
Im doing the job you hired me to do.
I tell people that Sterling Cooper is the only place to be.
Youve been pitching more to me than you have to clients.
What does that mean?
It means youve been selling their ideas to me
more than mine to them.
When I was in the Marine Corps, I missed duty.
Fell down the steps or something.
My squad leader covered, but then I confessed to the men.
He laid down some r*fle fire for me, and I acted like I didnt need it.
Thats not the situation I want to be in here.
So what, youre covering for me?
Who am I in this story?
Im grateful, Don.
If you hadnt brought me in, where would I be?
Some fifth wheel at McCann?
Look, I did everything I could for you on American Airlines.
It was a risk worth taking.
People think of us differently.
What do you want me to say?
That were on the same team?
That I love being in your unit?
Sarge, Im scared?
You have an "I told you so," okay?
Can we move forward?
Im the one that looks bad.
It hasnt hurt the company.
Yes.
Of course we can.
And I will tell Roger we had lunch.
Well. Good, then.
Okay.
Where did you come from?
You dont want to know.
Wait.
I love it.
Im warm and Im cold.


What time is it?
A little after 4.
I have to get ready.
Where are you going?
My daughters in a play.
Daughter?
Is that everyone?
Shes at Sarah Lawrence.
How much preparation do you need?
You dont want me to go.
I took the afternoon off.
For me?
Youre a lion, arent you?
Now I know what you like.
You can go.
I know I can.
Do you want to stay here?
Watch TV?
Go through my things?
I would never leave you alone in my place.
Yes, you would.
Stay.
Relax.
Believe me, Im the same way.
It has to come out somewhere.
Ill get you out in time for dinner, I promise.
Whats going on?
You here to audition?
No one told me about this.
Im taking pictures. You can look at the pictures.
I didnt know youd want to come.
Is Paul in there?
A lot of guys are in there.
You can come in if you want.
No. Im just surprised because I have an eye for this.
Dont worry about Kinsey.
I wont let him put anything together without you.
Whos next?
Hey, girl.
You look lost.
Chauncey.
Here he is.
I apologize, Chauncey.
I thought you were a girl.
Beautiful dog.
Where have you been hiding him?
I made my wife give him back to me.
Missed him too much.
I like dogs.
Dogs are better than wives.
Never a problem communicating.
I like having one in the office.
Makes us look more easygoing,
friendly, you know, to clients.
Maybe Ill bring one in, too.
What breed do you have?
I dont have one.
I was going to get one for the office.
I dont think thats a good idea.
Good night, Campbell.
Come on, Chauncey.
What were you doing in Sterling Cooper?
There was a casting call for Playtex.
Right.
The fellas are calling it the bra-ditions.
Thats funny.
You work there?
I do.
Want me to find out how it went?
I already know. Not well.
I find that hard to believe.
Well, they fall in love with a picture of you,
and then you come in, and theyre disappointed.
But it doesnt make any sense because all they need is a picture.
I didnt bring my camera with me,
but I cant imagine it being better than this.
I dont know. Maybe I look tired.
I just flew back from working in London.
London?
Whats your name?
Peter Campbell.
Oh, my. Account executive.
I love the taste of Scotch.
Thank you.
Stop. Turn around.
Let me look at you.
When I first saw you,
I thought you were foreign.
Really? Is that right?
Hold that.
I have company.
Ill be right back.
Who was that?
- My mother. - Really?
What, you didnt think I had a mother?
Its okay.
Hold on.
Up the long, delirious, burning blue,
I topped the windswept heights with easy grace
where never lark or even eagle flew.
And while with silent lifting mind
I strode the high untrespassed
sanctity of space,
put out my hand,
and touched the face of God.
You want me to fix you something?
Whats that?
Cereal.
No. That.
Do you like it?
I bought it at the auction.
Can I speak to you a minute?
What? Whats wrong?
Where are you going in that?
Swimming.
You asked me if I like it. I dont.
What are you talking about?
Im talking about a 15-year-old lifeguard.
Im talking about a bunch of tennis pros,
not to mention all those loafing millionaires taking the summer off.
- Do you want to be ogled? - Oh, Don.
Everybody bought one at the auction.
Its desperate.
I didnt know that.
I have to go.
See you tonight.
Joan, there you are.
Are you aware that Im on the Playtex account?
What about it?
Please tell the girls I am to be included in all the memos.
Sure. For a moment there,
I thought you were just another person coming to ask me about my brassiere.
Why arent I on the list?
I dont know what to tell you.
Im not involved in that.
Theres business going on, and Im not invited.
Im a good drinker.
What are you asking me?
You know how this office works.
Parts of it.
Forget it.
Ive never had your job.
Ive never wanted it.
Youre in their country.
Learn to speak the language.
You dont talk that way.
I dont need to.
And honestly,
youve never listened to a word Ive said.
You want to be taken seriously?
Stop dressing like a little girl.
Jacqueline Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe.
Women have feelings about these women
because men do.
Because we want both, they want to be both.
Its about how they want to be seen by us...
their husbands, their boyfriends,
their friends husbands.
Heres the idea, very simply.
The bra is called the Harlequin.
In fit and form, it should be your very best.
It comes in black and white.
Jackie, Marilyn.
Same incredible fit,
two different women.
And the beauty of it is its the same woman,
the same model.
Look at that. It is.
And even if you dont notice it,
you still get a bit of an "Aha"
when you read the copy.
"Nothing fits both sides of a woman
better than Playtex."
Its a very impressive idea, Don.
I like the girl.
So will your customers.
Its a very flattering mirror.
This definitely moves you into Maidenforms neighborhood.
But sales have been so good
when we talk about how well our brassieres fit.
I dont know what to say.
We were talking in the cab on the way over.
Let Maidenform have womens imaginations.
Well take their money.
I couldnt have said it better myself.
Well, I apologize for the goose chase.
Were very sorry.
No one else can have this campaign, right?
Its yours.
Well keep it on file for you.
A pleasure.
- Thanks again. - Thanks for coming in.
That was a waste of inspiration.
These people.
Dont worry. Its not your fault.
They made up their minds on the way over.
Why put up a fight?
I think we bought a couple years of security.
If they ever decide they want to go that way,
they know we can do it.
Listen, we would love to show our appreciation
by entertaining you gentlemen tonight.
And you can put it on our bill.
Make sure Don knows hes invited.
Where should we go?
Surprise us.
If we were to take you to see some girls in their underwear,
would you feel like youre at work?
No. That sounds good.
Well, let us clear the decks.
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.
Thats on 44th and 8th.
We will be there, and the tab will be open.
Im going to go tell Campbell.
Take care.
Good to see you.
- See you there. - Bye-bye.
Mr. Phillips.
We have artwork in the evening papers, son,
and I dont have them.
Someones supposed to put them on my desk,
Friday or not.
Should I get some?
What do you think?
Ill be right back.
Its flattering to be able to keep you interested.
Stop talking.
Why dont you want me to talk?
You know you want me to.
Do I?
You do.
Touch me.
No.
Dont stop torturing me.
I want the full Don Draper treatment.
Youre spoiling the mood.
I wanted it, and I got it,
and its better than they said.
What?
Have no fear.
Youre known as a connoisseur.
You have lots of fans.
Are you talking about me?
I wasnt, no.
Well, who was?
What?
Who?
Sarah Tierney at Random House.
I dont know who youre talking about.
Stop.
This is nobodys maiden voyage here,
handsome.
You have a reputation.
Enjoy it.
Does it make you feel better to think that Im like you?
My goodness.
Gloves come off.
I like this.
You want to blindfold me?
What are you doing?
Are you going?
I told you to stop talking.
Thank you.
People are going to think youre the mayor.
Hey, look, its Peggy.
What are you doing here?
I dont know. I heard we were celebrating.
I thought Id stop by.
Did you now?
- Stay for one drink. - Okay.
Youre staying all night, honey.
Now you got the best seat in the house.
Tell me what you want for Christmas.
Yeah!
What do you want for breakfast?
Grapefruit.
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, you.
Im not going to talk.
I dont want you to cut yourself.
Are you okay, Daddy?
You know what, Sally?
I think you better leave me alone.
