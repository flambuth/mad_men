(THEME SONG PLAYING)
Ive never worn mink before.
Its chinchilla,and it costs $15,000.
How does that make you feel?
Nervous.
Youre not supposed to talk.
Just show me how you feel.
Walk over to the mirror.
Look at yourself.
You like what you see.
Dont open the whole coat.
Just try and make it lookhke
youre just wearing the fur.
Very good.
Now, I want youto close your eyes
and take a deep breath.
And when I tell you,
youre gonna put your legup on that chair,
let the coat slide down,
and show mehow smooth your skin is.
Very good, Cindy-
Thank you very much, Cindy.Well let you know.
WOMAN". So, what happened?
Well, no woman,even living in that sh*thole,
wants a toasterfor her birthday.
- Can you freshen this?- Yeah.
And Abigail wasnt shy.
- Thats your mother?- Stepmother.
So she put the toasterin the middle of the table,
and all the boarders come downfor breakfast and see it.
They werentparticularly impressed.
Every day, one of themwould trip over that wire
and yank it off the table.
Dont go back there.A lot of roaches.
Are you surprised?
Only by the size. There was onemaking a phone call.
(LAUGHS)
Get up, I want my seat back.
Now, toasters wereindestructible back then,
except for the cord,
which suffered from being yankedout of the wall every morning.
My Uncle Mack was cheapand thought he could fix things.
So he wrapped a pieceof copper wire around it.
Sure enough, he plugged it inand it blew him into the parlor.
He was unconscious.
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
All the boarders got up,ran to his aid,
but Abigail didnt move.
She just looked down at himand said
"Happy birthday."
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
Then put the kettle on.
He loves to tell storiesabout how poor he was,
but hes not anymore.
Is that your way of sayingyou want me to get the check?
Hey, Mildred Pierce,can I get the check?
- Come on.- Be polite.
- Can I get you something else?- No, just the check.
You have anythingby John Dos Passos?
(GIRLS LAUGHING)
Sorry about my friend. Hes...
Witty.
Do I know you?
I dont think so.
Shes a little old for NYU.
$11.60. You must have had a lotof hash browns, sweetheart.
Probably only eats once a week.
Lets split it five ways.
No, I think I owe someonean apology.
That ought to do it.
Thats $100.
I suppose Im gonna have todrop one of you off.
You decide who.
Don, lets go.
Yeah.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Good evening, Mr. Draper.
- Who am I speaking with?- Its Joanne.
You have four messages.
At 7:30, Laura called and said
she has a photo sh**tin the morning,
so dont call after 11:00.
What time is it?
10 past, but she called again at8:00 and said midnight was fine.
(CHUCKLES)
- What else?- 9:30, Maxine called.
She met you two weeks agoat Cosmopolitan
and remains intriguedby your proposition.
And last, at 10:00,Tricia from TWA.
Shes on a layover.
- And what are you doing tonight, Joanne?- Youre very funny, Mr. Draper.
Give me Tricias number.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
So glad you could make it.
OHares a mess.They canceled everything,
so it seemed to be fate.
You look ravishing.
I feel a little underdressed.
Where were you tonight?
No, its true.
On every single flight,
theres always one blanketcompletely soaked in urine.
- In first class?- Oh, yes.
(TRICIA SHRIEKING)
(LAUGHING)Im sorry.
Its your fault. You scared me.
Do you have a towel?
Dont do that.
(BOTH GIGGLING)
Another womanyoure sleeping with?
No, thats the woman Im notsleeping with. My ex-wife.
Hanes calls them Leggs.
Theyre crap.
Theyre definitely notas high-quality as Topaz.
Theyre in four test markets
and theyre outspending you6-to-1.
And outselling you 20-to-1.
Its more than the packaging.Its the placement.
Theyre not just selling themin drugstores.
Theyre focusingon supermarkets.
And theyre only $1.39 a pair.
So we need to lower our priceand buy more ad time?
This is only a novelty,and the inferior quality
will catch up with them,
but were recommending a changeright now
while it sorts itself out.
Look, I know you thinkIm cheap.
And I know you thinkTopaz are cheap,
although apparentlynot cheap enough,
but I just wanna spend moneywhere itll make a difference.
They got an egg.Why dont we have a topaz?
Big plastic jewel. Green.
Maybe its see-through.
And Mr. Potato Head herecan relax
cause hell still make hisquota when we launch it.
Id never recommend imitationas a strategy.
Youll be second,which is very far from first.
Whose fault is that?
I told you about the developmentof this product
and you didnt seem worriedat all.
Art, Marvin,are you ready for lunch?
Yes, lam, Kenneth. We hada problem, but we solved it.
Well, thats great to hear.
What do we do?
We keep the client.
How was the party?
David Baileywants to take your picture.
Well, I have plans tonight.
So Ill be leaving at 5:00 on the dotand I dont wanna hear about it.
Wake me in...
You have casting in an hour.
Great.
You have lunch plans?
Just coffee,if the waits not too long.
No, I just thought,Im going to the coffee shop,
so I couldpick you up something.
Mathis, youre pouring coffee.
I wanted to ask youabout something.
You want a raise?Stop acting like a secretary.
This has nothing to dowith work.
My brother-in-law is in town
and I thought you could joinJulie and I for dinner.
Hes very handsome.The whole family is.
Youre setting me up?
He has a car.
Its very sweet, but I reallyhave to question yourjudgment.
You know, youre a catch.
Thank you,but how could you think
this has nothingto do with work?
I told my wife that,
and she said it wont mattercause she has a knack for this.
What happens if I take you up onthis offer and it goes badly,
or hes homely or anythinghappens, good or bad?
Did you think about that?
No, I didnt anticipateany of this, Ill be honest with you.
I appreciate it, but no,thank you.
Tell Julieshes very thoughtful.
Are you auditioning?
I tried to arrange a meeting,
but Meredith explainedhow much work you have to do.
We met with Topaz and hadthe unpleasant conversation.
And their solution was aknockoff topaz container, green.
What was our solution?
We dont have one.
The irony is, theyre being pushedout of the bottom of the market.
Whats the top,department stores?
Yeah, but theyre a drugstorebrand. Thats what Topaz is.
So theyre notcalled Topaz anymore.
Tell them their ideafor new packaging was good,
but the new packagingshould say, "Macys."
Thats gonna be tough
with the stores are beingblown up by radicals every day.
You know these two.
People havent stopped shopping.
So all I have to do is signMacys. Piece of cake.
Doesnt McCann representMarshall Fields?
Remind themits a two-way street.
Phil was in plastics,hes going to metals,
and Greg was in metals,
hes going to marketingand advertising,
which is my old job.
That means Tom Schaeffer is headof plastics at Dow Chemical.
Good for him.
Good for you.
Nows a good time.
Hes still not up.
Never wake a sleeping baby.
I want to see him.
Whats that?
We dont want youto think of this as retirement,
think of it as the beginningof your professional career.
I dont know what to say.
You say "Jack Nicklaus, out of my way.Ive got better clubs."
Im very touched.
Ever since your mother passed away,I havent really enjoyed anything.
Honestly, Ed.
He thinks hes a comedian.
Im just glad theres something that willget him out of the house besides that boat.
Who says Ill be in the house?
Ive got a lot of timeto make up for.
Daddy, Im so glad.
Most men my age have hada couple of heart attacks.
Im still young enough to enjoythings. New things, even.
Ive started cooking.
Actually made myself a...What is it, honey?
A Pop-Tart, Ed.
It was very good.
Next.
This is another girl.
Rachel?
Im supposed to tell you,you missed your flight.
Thank you.
Rachel.
Yes?
Youre not just smooth,youre Wilkinson smooth.
Back to work.
Is it morning?
No. Go back to sleep.
Thats why I like surveying.You see, Im the outdoor type.
Sorry, did I wake you?
Its okay.Did Eddie wake up again?
My dad is so old.
Dont worry about him.He is going to have a ball.
Why did he wait so longto do that?
Honey, he loved his job.
But you dont.
Youre bored and angry
because you know its notwhat you wanna do.
I shouldnever tell you anything.
And I havent gotten any writing donein a long time.
So start now.
Youve done very well
and lets stop pretendinglike I wasnt born with plenty.
You could quit your job.We could buy that farm.
You could write your book.
What book?
Something sad and sweet.
For people who dont have theguts to live their dream.
Why dont you write a book?
You gave them your eye.
Dont give themthe rest of your life.
Your father was a cogin a giant machine
that makes w*apon and poison.
And you sell them.
(BABY CRYING IN BACKGROUND)
Im proud of the company!
And if nothing else, Id like towait and see if I get a raise.
Theres always another hurdle.
Youre not listening to meat all!
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)
Youre late.
Its five after.
Casting always starts on time.
Cant you smellthe cheap perfume?
Can you call Rachel Katzat Menkens Department Store?
No. You know what, set a meeting.The numbers in the Rolodex.
Its regarding Topaz Pantyhose.
Of course.
Youre not the landing partywe expected.
What can we do for you?
As I was telling David hereon the phone,
Leggs Pantyhoseis an unstoppable foe
in the affordable pantyhosemarketplace.
Our client, Topaz Pantyhose,
has the high qualityto wear a department store name.
It is a growingand lucrative product.
In three months,Leggs has sold a years worth.
Theyre worried that Leggs aregonna spread all over the world?
That wouldnt bother me at all.
(MEN LAUGHING)
We were hoping McCann Ericksoncould provide, at the minimum,
an introductionto your department store clients
so we can assess their desirefor a store brand.
I know theyd be happyto meet you.
Especially Dan Higgins.He loves redheads.
Would you tell him whats sospecial about your panties?
The benefits are listed there,
but basicallytheyre more sheer, softer,
and more like silk to the touch,yet still very strong.
So you can pull them downover and over?
You can wear them quite a few times
before they run or lose shape.
- Do you wear them, Joan?- I do.
If you talk to Dan,Id start with that.
I think anyone would beequally interested
in the price-per-unit,
which could be reduced a lotif the demand were higher.
Why arent youin the brassiere business?
Excuse me?
You should bein the bra business.
Youre a work of art.
What shes saying is thatwider distribution
would mean bigger ad budgetsfor us.
Id set a lunch, but I thinka dinner would be better.
And warm him up first.
Send a basket of pearsto Marshall Fields.
The one thing Dan likesis a nice pear.
(MEN LAUGHING)
This guy.What are their billings?
If you take a lookat the sheet there again.
Yeah. Give us a minute.Lets read this thing.
Where were you?
Shirley, youre not going to believe this,but I walked to work today.
Mr. Sterlingand Mr. Donnelly are here.
They just walked in.
You wanted to see me?
You know Ferguson Donnellyfrom McCann.
- Of course. Ferg, good to see you.- Been a while.
Is this about the Topazdepartment store route?
I think its a great idea.
I dont knowwhat youre talking about.
Did you send Ed Baxtera $200 set
of MacGregor golf clubsfrom the firm?
Actually, I hand-delivered it.It was a retirement gift.
Ive got some bad news for you.Petes gonna take over Dow.
Because of the clubs?
No, because McCann doesntwant you on the business.
Just cause Eds retiringdoesnt mean
I cant get alongwith his replacement.
I know Greg from metals.
I dont care if you know a girlfrom Kalamazoo.
We dont want youon the business
because we dont want youon any business.
Look, Ferg, youre not still madat me for leaving?
That was six years ago.
And you never hired me anyway.
When you boughtPutnam, Powell & Lowe,
I came with the furniture.
People come in and out of ourdoors all the time, Ken,
but they dont walk out with $4 millionof Birds Eye products.
Of course they do.
Fine.
They dont walk aroundthe office like their shit doesnt stink
and then go outand tell the world were, what,
a bunch of black Irish thugs?
Youre gonna fire mebecause I hurt Fergs feelings?
Its what he is. Look at him.
How about a little dignity?
Youre firing me!
Yes, but youll get a generousseverance package
if you help Pete secure allof your accounts, including Dow.
Roger saidhed be glad to recommend you.
Thank you, Roger.I appreciate your loyalty.

(ELEVATOR DINGS)
- Should we get lunch?- I want to burn this place down.
I know. They were awful.
But at least we got a yes.
Would you have ratherhad a friendly no?
I dont expect youto understand.
Joan, youve never experiencedthat before?
Have you, P9993?
I dont know.You cant have it both ways.
You cant dressthe way you do...
How do I dress?
Look, they didnt take meseriously, either.
So what youre saying is
I dont dress the way you dobecause I dont look like you.
And thats very, very true.
You know what?Youre filthy rich.
You dont have to do anythingyou dont want to.
How was the cattle call?
We have to have another session.
Youre shameless, you know that?
Do I have a lunch today?
No, but you havea busy afternoon.
I scheduleda meeting next Monday
with Mr. Rosenthalat Menkens Department Store.
Mrs. Katz didnt want to meet?
Well, it wasa very awkward conversation
because apparently she steppeddown a few months ago
and passed away last week.
What?
Rachel Katz?
Yes.
Im sorry to tell you that.
Last week?
I had no intentionof upsetting you.
How old was she?
I dont know. Younger than me.
From the name,I just pictured some old lady.
I had no idea.
If youd like, theyve askedthat in lieu of flowers,
you can send a donation to
the National Jewish Hospitalat Denver.
Do you want to do that?
No. Yes, sure.
Im going to run downand get you a sandwich.
- Im leaving. Need anything?- No.
Mathis.
Yes?
Well, if it helps you get backinto your wifes good graces,
I had a cancellation
and Id love to join youfor dinner tomorrow night.
sh**t, we already madeother plans.
Oh.
Well, it wasnt meant to be.
Stevie doesnt need tocome with us.
Ill sell his ticket.
- Stevie? How old is he?- I dont know, 30?
- I dont know.- Can I go?
Give him my number.Tell him to call me.
Okay.
(CUTLERY SCRAPING PLATES)
You want a menu?
Just coffee. And could youget her attention for me?
Di!
Just coffee for him.
Evening.
Can I help you?
You look so familiar to me.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Yes, from here. The other night.
No.
I think I know you.
You dont need a line.
I know why youre here, andits not for a cup of coffee.
Vi, Im taking my break.
(CARS HONKING IN DISTANCE)
My name is Don.
(BELT UNBUCKLING, ZIPPER OPENING)
Excuse me, miss.
When are you done here?
You got your $100s worth.You can go.
(ELEVATOR BEEPING)
- Have fun last night?- Yes, I did.
Hes very handsome.
Don. Don?
- Are you okay?- Im done.
McCann told Roger to do it,and, boy, did Roger do it.
They want me to giveall my accounts to Pete.
Im calling Jim Hobart right now.Youre the head of accounts.
Do you want to hearsomething spooky?
Dont do anything rash, Ken.Its just a job.
No, my father-in-law retiresand my wife says,
"I want you to quit.Youre wasting your life.
"You should write that novel."
And you know what?I think I was gonna do it.
And the very next day,they fire me.
Can you believe that?
No.
Thats not a coincidence.Thats a sign.
- Of what?- The life not lived.
So thats good?
Yeah. Its great.
Now I just have to figure out
how to drag myselfthrough those doors.
(PHONE BUZZING)
SECRETARY: Joan, you have a callfrom Dennis.
Dennis who?
Im not sure.His girl just said Dennis.
Hes at McCann Erickson.
Its Dennis Ford.
Should I put him through?
No. Tell him Im in a meeting.
So, Clara just left?
She was as big as a house.
Is Torkelson going to marry her?
Hes probably just lookingthe other way.
People do that around hereall the time.
I swear I found out afteryou did. It came from McCann.


So did your millions of dollars.
You know, I didnt really getmillions of dollars.
I mean, eventually,
but stepped outin smaller increments
to stay under thattop tax threshold.
Ill have to buy an apartmentbuilding to keep any of it,
and then Ive got to bea landlord.
Sounds like a realpain in the ass.
Look, I was caught by surprise,
but I didnt know your historywith McCann.
What did you do over there?
I never fit in. Im not Irish.Im not Catholic. I can read.
(LAUGHING)
Its good youre playing ball,or youd have no future.
In advertising, maybe.
You have other plans?
I may havelet it go for a while,
but damned if I dont havesomething to write about now.
No, this world is boring.
You should writean adventure story.
Do you know how greatyoull look on a book jacket?
Ive thought about it.
Im a hell of lot better at itthan I ever was at this.
Good for you. Im envious.
I thought I was changing my lifewhen I went out to California.
Of course, now it sort of feelslike a dream,
but at the time,it felt so real.
Well, thats you, I guess.
I know. Look, here I am.
And you know what?If you get tired of the writing,
you can always use my name.
Ive only good thingsto say about you.
I appreciate that.
Jesus, Fillmore Auto Parts?
You trying to give me stuffwe dont even have anymore?
This is the sameas the navy one.
Dont tell Oscar de la Renta,because the navy one is $159.
I can wear boots with that.
You know what?
Ill take the bootsand the tan heels,
the chiffon, the redand this one.
Didnt you used to work here?
You can probablystill get the discount.
Thats tempting,
but I think you have me confusedwith someone else.
Could you?
(PHONE BUZZING)
MEREDITH: Ted wants to see you.
Send him in.
Got off the phonewith Wilkinson.
They narrowed it downto three girls.
They want meto send over the binder,
but theres120 Polaroids in here.
Itll make things worse.
Theyre perverts.They love casting.
They cant decide? Use them all.
There are three womenin every mans life.
You did not just think that up.
Ive had it for years,but I think it works here.
Youd rather find new creativethan pick a girl?
Speaking of which, Vogue is throwinga party in the Village tonight.

Okay.

So, youre from Atlanta?

Is it?
Ah. Here we go.
This smells delicious.
It does.
Didnt you order lasagna?
This is just as good.
Do you want my cannelloni?Its like lasagna.
More than veal, anyway.
You tryingto make this complicated?
I dont know why youre eatingwhat you didnt order.
Do you like veal?
What am I supposed to do?Send it back like a prima donna?
Youre just gonnaeat someone elses dinner?
I can either be a jerkand send it back,
or eat it and look weak.
I dont want this to get cold.
Johnny said you doesnt put upwith things.
Really?
What else did Mathis say?
He said you were funny.
And that you were fearless.
I love veal.
Excuse me. Can I help you?
Should I take my shoes off?
No, thats justfor the mourners.
I just wantedto pay my respects.
I worked with Rachel.
At the store?Im Barbara, her sister.

(LAUGHING)Ive never thought of that.
You dont seem like a lawyer.
I just left a firm in Bostonbecause they felt the same way.
I once quit a jobbecause I wanted to go to Paris.
Do they do that in advertising?
Sure. We sh**t commercialsabroad all the time.
Well, some people do.
So all you have to do is
write something in Parisand you can go.
- Am I wrong?- Yes.
Thats not how it works.
Well, next vacation.
I havent taken a vacation...
Well, never.
You know what? Lets go.
Sure. Where?
To Paris.
Lets go to Paris, right now.
You think youre kidding around,but I dont have a job.
Im not kidding.
Okay. Im getting the check.

Ive never actually used it.
Youve never used your passport?
Stop.
What? Why?

I cant believe this.I cant find my passport.
Its okay.This is a romantic spot.

Im sorry, but whatwere we going to do in Paris?

Hello, Pete.
Roger, I wanted to tell youI wont be collecting severance.
You got another job?Good for you.
But youre still entitled.
It wouldnt be right.
My signing bonusfrom Dow is so big,

What are you talking about?
I wasnt just Eds son-in-law.
They actually valuetheir relationships.
I suppose they need a guyin fertilizer.
Im taking Tom Schaeffersold post.
Head of advertising.
So, youre going to fire us?
No, its going to be way worsethan that.
Im going to be your client.
And I hate to tell you,but Im very hard to please.
Until we meet again.
Shit.

If you want changes,we gotta talk now.
Sure, fine, just keep your voice down.

Wow. First date magic.

Wait.
What?
L.-
I had this dreamabout a woman I once knew.
And I found out the next dayshe had just died.
Is that who you think I am?
No, I dont think so.
Well, I want you to think very carefullyabout when you really had that dream
because when people die,everything gets mixed up.
I dont know. Maybe.
Maybe you dreamt about herall the time.
Maybe.
When someone dies, you justwant to make sense out of it.
But you cant.
Im not saying thisto lead you on
or make you more interested,
but the next time you comein here, please bring a date.
I just work here.
I just want to sit here.
Okay.
