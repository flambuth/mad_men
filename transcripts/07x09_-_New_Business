Dont you have to get ready for work?
I dont feel like it.
DIANA: Hmm.
Gentlemen, Im going to be strict,
but this is Torkelsons law.

(MEN LAUGHING)
Ah! Well, if youll all excuse me.
Come on, Ill introduce you.
Pima Ryan, this is ourart director Stan Rizzo.
So youll be cutting up my work, will you?
Well, I try to treat it like art

Today, its vermouth.
I apologize the models have so many teeth.
I know youre not used to that.
Pleasure to meet you.
Im sorry about that.He has a hard time with
new people.
No, he hates himself.
(CHUCKLES)
I dont think so. Hes got a huge ego.
And hes a photographer.

Look at all youre doing here.
(STAMMERING) Its just my job.
Good morning, girls.

- Good morning.- Its 11:30.
Where were you? I was worried.
I was sleepy.
Mr. Sterlings in there.Hes not to be disturbed.
Who are you hiding from?
I got two secretaries and three telephones.
I feel like Marlin Perkinsis chasing me on the savannah.
Hiding is pointless.
Ive got work to do.
Thats the other reason Im here.
McCann represents Derby Foods.Peter Pan Peanut Butter.
Theyre making a cookie.
Sounds delicious.
McCann also represents Nabisco.National Biscuit Company.
They got the word "cookie" in their name.
No, they dont.
Do we have a sh*t at Derby?
No, its just a cookie.
McCanns clients areour clients. Were helping out.
You and Peter are taking themgolfing tomorrow.
I cant make it.
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
MEREDITH: Theres a messengerhere from your attorneys office.
He needs your signature.
Since when cant you go golfing?
Since Burt Petersons the account man.
Good news or bad news?
Good news. Its almost over.
Well, dont settle untilyou get the number you want.
Take it from me, no matter what she says,you have given her the good life.
Shed never have had it.
Megan is not Jane.
So she never said you squanderedher youth and beauty?
Used up her childbearing years?
Thwarted her career? What career?
- Shes a consumer.- (INTERCOM BUZZING)
MEREDITH: Mr. Sterling, are youstill at lunch? Theyre wondering.
She made her choices.
(DOOR CLOSING)
Youre very good.
(SIGHS)
Can I help you?
Well, Ive been told that my negativesbelong to the agency
and therefore processinghas to be done at your lab.
Im not comfortable with that.
I hate to break it to you,
but its not really yours anymore.
Dont you have a darkroom here?
Yes, but I cant do that.
I started off as a clerkwith a newspaper in Sarasota.
All I wanted was to get in that darkroom.
Its a nice thing to have,especially in the city.
So, youre a photographer.
I do everything.
Im an art director.
You must show me your work.
I dont know.
I can feel the tensionof your need for my opinion.
I wouldnt mind you taking a look
if you promise to be honest.
Lets see how brave you are.

MARIE-FRANCE: Stop it this minute.
Ugh, I have to go change for lunch.
Um...

He gave me a check for $500.
Like a whore?
In the States, its the 20th century.
People get divorced all the time.
Exactly. You can still get an annulment.
Im not like you.
I dont spend my wholelife feeling ashamed.
Marie-France, dont be a bitch.
I am not a servant here to wait on her
while she goes for lunch.
I know you dont understand this,
but its for my career.
Good luck with your bright future.
Wait.

I dont know why we couldntswing by your apartment?
What will the clients think?That youre renting clubs?
Ill buy a set in the shop.
Megans moving her things today.
(SIGHS)
I didnt know that was still going on.
They want to punish you.
And then you get madand you want to punish them,
but you know its your fault.
Ive been through it before.
How did you handle client dinners?
I got a date.
I dont have a steady,so its too unpredictable.
You dont know how muchtheyre going to drink
and suddenly youre with a floozy.
Golf is better.
Jiminy Christmas.
You think youre going to begin your lifeover and do it right,
but what if you neverget past the beginning again?
Watch the road.
(SIGHS)
You filled the whole truck,that wasnt what we agreed.
I told you it was gonna be more.
More than double?
- Fine, how much you got?- I have $350.
Thats enough for meto leave it on the sidewalk.
Thats extortion!
Lady, you are a pain in my ass.
(PHONE RINGING)

MEREDITH: Theres a Mariesomething on the line.
Marie who?

Bonjour.
I am in desperate need of you.
Well, hello to you, too.
I need you to come to Donsapartment with $200
and not a penny more!
Calm down. Ill send someone.
What did I expect?
Every time you getwhat you want, you run away.
Dont say that.
Bring cash!
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Its fine.
Look where you are.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Dont. Im not ready.
Your subject certainly is.
Oh, thats Elaine. Shes, uh...
Overdeveloped?
Shes not worthy of you.
You can see it in her eyes.
She doesnt want to tell you the truth.
Drawing is a much more rare talent.
Oh.
I expected more.
- Holy shit.- What?
- Where is everything?- On the truck.
Pay him.
One hundred and eighty bucks.
My pleasure.
Don agreed to this?
He was very generous.
And you are a true gentleman.
Uh-huh.
Lets get outta here. Ill buy you a drink.
I hate what he did to my daughter.
Mon Dieu, Im trembling.
You really are. Its okay.
What are you doing?
You already emptied the place.You wanna defile it as well?
Please.
Take advantage of me.
- You look ravishing.- Thank you.
Im really sorry Im late.You know that office.
- Should we get some wine?- I already did.
I am certainly picking up the check.
I insist.
Its just, you had such goodadvice for Miranda and Jill.
Well, they didnt have agents at all.My advice was get one.
(CHUCKLES) Well, whatever you did.
To whatever I did.
So, give me the lay.
You know, of the land.
Theres not much to tell.
I havent booked anythingin the last few months.
Not even pilot season?
Well, I turned down somesmaller parts because
Alan thought theyd take meout of the running for leads.
Im not in his business,
but I find it hard to believethat youre losing any contest.
I bet he doesnt knowhow to get you in one.
I read all the time, Harry.
Do you read for lead parts?
Thats just getting yourname on the right list
with the right casting director.
Good agents with real trackrecords can make that happen.
Alan represents Angie Dickinson.
You are every mans fantasy.
Youre like Ali MacGrawand Brigitte Bardot had a baby.
You should be the mostfamous person in the world right now.
Oh, my goodness!
You should be in this business.
I cant believe Don threw you away.
Hes not a loyal person, but I am.
You dont think he could have helped you?
Im willing to put my moneywhere my mouth is.
It would be much appreciated.
Im gonna be honest, Im not hungry.
Id rather get to work on this immediately.
Well, we can work and eat. I have a pen.
Well, I have a room upstairs.
It has a phone. I could make some calls.
Harry.
Im not interested.
Megan, youre a big girl.
Maybe youre in this situation
because of how youre reacting to this.
Hold on. Forget all that.
Come on. Have another glass of wine.
Caroline, I was busy, okay?
Now, how about at least giving me a pat onthe back for remembering I had a meeting?
- (DOOR OPENING)- Hello?
What are you doing here, Megan?
Where the f*ck is everything?
Roger...
(GASPS)
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
He came to help me.
I should go.
Why are you here?I told you to go to the hotel.
I felt guilty that I leftyou here, but obviously...
Im late for a meeting.
I guess you dont carethat shes married to my father.
It wasnt my idea.
You dont get to stand in judgment of me.
(DOOR SLAMMING)
Could you give us a second, honey?
No, thank you. Have you spoken with Megan?
I just walked in.
Well, I think I should warn you.
We had lunch and, uh,
shes not stable, Don.
She said a lot of crazy thingsand Im sure will continue to say them.
And what will she say about you?
Crazy things. You know, all I can say isshe really wants a job.
What does that mean?
Don, come on, nothing happened.You know she hates me.
You know what? Its none of my business.
Well, I dont think I could havehelped her anyway.
She quit her soap and left New York.It was a really dumb idea.
Pima?
Could you come in? I have the selects.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Could you get the door?
I put the ones that I like beston the top row here.
I like this one,
but Stan doesnt.
Stan already showed these to you?
He was eager to share,
but he knows nothing about women.
What does that mean?
It was just his opinion.
Well, mines the only opinion thatmatters here. Its my account.
Of course, youre in charge. I know that.
Which one do you like?
I think number three. Top row.
Youve never been married.
Nope.
Me either.
The adventures I would have missed.
Number four.
I would love to take your picture.
(STAMMERING) Oh, I...
I dont know about that.
The way youre looking at me right now...
I would capture that.
How are you?
Where is he? He was right behind me.
I dont want anything of yours.
I wasnt going to say a word.
I wasnt gonna give you the satisfaction
of knowing that you ruined my life.
Megan.
Why did I believe you?
Why did I believe thethings you said to me?
Why am I being punished for being young?
I gave up everything for youbecause I believed you...
And youre nothing but a liar.
An aging, sloppy, selfish liar.
Youre right.
(SCOFFS) Youre gonna write me a check?
I want you to have
the life you deserve.
(SCOFFS)
Are you kidding me?
No.
A million dollars?
Why are you doing this to me?Its not funny.
I dont want to fight anymore.
Well, I know its not real.
Nothing about you is.
It is real.
Please take it.
Megan, Im sorry.
Send me the papers.
I want you to be honest.
Should I let my hair grow out?
Good night, everybody. Ed, you were right.
Pimas a treasure.
Is she?
You dont like the work?
Because I was thinking, you know,shed be right for Butler shoes.
Or maybe Topaz pantyhose.
Shes got a thing for legs.
Womens legs.
Sorry to disappoint you.
Im not disappointed.
Neither was she.
Really?
Does that bother you?
No,
But I bet it might bother Ellen.
Elaine.
This is none of your business.
No.
Its Pimas business,
which turns out to be moreadvertising than art.
Shes a hustler.
Youre jealous.
She tried the same thing with me,
but she didnt get as far.
And thats why Im not goingto give her another job.
I dont believe you.
Which part?
(SPEAKING FRENCH)
Not particularly.
So you ordered room service?
I dont care.
Shes leaving Papa.
Im going to pack.
I dont want to hear about it.
You know its a sin to be a ghoul
and feed on everyones pain?
Shes been very unhappyfor a very long time.
At least she did something about it.
Im exhausted.
Me, too.
Did you print anything?
Theyre drying-
You did?
How were they? What did Pima say?
She loved them.
How about you?
(SIGHS)
Do you want a drink? I just have vodka.
Yes, please.
Oh...
I got you something.
Open it.
Its a New York City guidebook.Finally start your tour.
Go on.
Cant you see I dont want anything?
Look, Im pretty sureI had a worse day than you.
Please dont be in a mood.
Im not in a mood.
And youve never had a worse day than me.
You dont think Ive felt grief?
You knew that about methe first night we met.
Ive been trying to talk myself out of it.
Dont.
No.
Talk myself out of what I have to say.
Youre scared. I understand.
But I took care of everything today.
Ive been separated a long time.
Youre not
the first thing to come along.
Im ready.
Youre fooling yourself if you thinkthisll make a difference.
You dont think I knowwhats going on here?
Look at this dump.
I know you think you deserve this.
Ive done it.
I left my daughter.
Stop blaming yourself.
No.
I had two children. Two girls.
One died and one...
My oldest is in Racine with her father.
Why? Dont you want to ask why?
No.
I told you about my heart.
I dont want to feel anything else.
When I was with you, I forgot about
her.
I dont ever want to do that.
