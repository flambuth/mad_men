- Hello?- Do you ever pray on a difficult problem?
Connie.
I had this revelation.
New York City is nota domestic destination like, say, Dallas.
Im sorry. What?
You know, God speaks to us.We have an impulse and we act on it.
- Thats very interesting.- So how do we know to do it, Don?
How do we know to do something?
Instinct.
So, youre just like a dog?
I knew the patina of the Waldorf wouldshine over all my domestic properties,
but it hasnt worked abroad.
I know I just gave you New York,but can you help me with that?
You want me to takeyour international business, Connie?
I want you to earn it. A little bit of wow,as a lady friend of mine used to say.
Let me think on that.
It sounds like pride, but I want Hiltonsall over the world, like missions.
I want a Hilton on the moon.Thats where were headed.
Okay.
America is wherever we look,wherever were going to be.
- Thats very good, Connie.- Youre the one who said that to me.
Well, I guess its not that memorable.
Write up a proposal forthe New York Hiltons as convention spaces.
Send it over to me by noon.Ill take it on the plane.
Done.
Goodbye.
- Im sorry about that.- Its okay.
I dont think the 4:00 a. m. Feedingsare over yet.
"I want what I want when I want it,"
and you dont care what it doesto the rest of us.
Like someone else I know. Yeah.
Babys up every three hours.Hilton only calls every four.
I think you like it.
What are you doing?
I cant sleep. Im going in.
What are you doing?
- Im running.- In the dark?
Its cool, its quiet and no one bothers me.
Youre wrong about that.
Let me give you a ride.Where are you going?
Im going home,and the whole idea is to run there.
Well, take a break. You smoke?
- The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King...- Take me up to Ross Lane.
...president of the Southern ChristianLeadership Conference, spoke at the march.
I have a dream that my four little children...
- Dont.... will one day live in a nation
where they will not be judgedby the color of their skin
but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.
Two young women were brutally m*rderin their Upper East Side apartment...
When school starts,Im going to read it to the kids the first day.
Do you think they can understand it?
I think they already know it, and itd be nicefor them to hear an adult say it.
Who are you?
I mean, dumb or pure?
Running out here in the middle of the nightand I run into you.
- How did that happen?- What are you doing on the road?
I dont know. I cant sleep.
- Right or left?- Just let me out up here.
- Its a nice house.- I rent the apartment over the garage.
- Have coffee with me.- Youll be late for work.
Im always late. Its coffee.
Maybe thats why you cant sleep.Too much coffee.
Good morning.
Sorry.
How long have you been there?I had no idea.
Can you get me some coffee, please?And I need you to type this up
and get it to Hiltonbefore he leaves for Europe.
Actually, hes going to California.
He already left two messages on the service.Do you want me to get him?
- This. Coffee. Hilton.- Of course.
- Mr. Draper usually brings this in.- He left early.
- Can we go outside now?- Its raining. Go upstairs.
- I did not sleep last night.- Go take a nap. Ill shop in the afternoon.
It could either be the view of the Acropolis,or just these big columns,
like youre standing there.
Then below it,"Your window on the world. Hilton," period.
That window looks as old to meas those columns.
Did anybody look at a pictureof the Athens Hilton?
Sliding doors dont read as windows.
And believe it or not,were not allowed to pretend
that thats the view from the windowof the Hilton, because its not.
Other than that?
The tag is flat.
- Well, that ones yours.- That doesnt make it good.
If its bad, dont use it.
What else?
There are 16 graphically-perfect reducedphotographs of Hilton hotels all on a grid.
- Simple headline.- "Go. Well meet you anywhere. "
Now that I can finally understand you, I amless impressed with what you have to say.
Thats your work, too.
- Whos we?- We are Hilton.
And how do I know that?
Take out a magnifying glassand look at one of those tiny hotels?
I write "Hilton" very big under this Greek.
There is no deadline.
I want to see work as you think of it.Give me more ideas to reject.
I cant do this all by myself.
- Im telling you, its bad for me.- Whats that supposed to mean?
And cut! Well, I think weve finally got it.
I told you, you had it the first time,if thats what you want.
And I told you I want what you want.
- Where is he supposed to be looking?- Onto the horizon.
We want people to focus on the Lucky.
- This is what your father signed off on.- Let me see it again.
Nathaniel, again, please.Watch through the camera.
Thats a good idea.
Action.
I just dont know what hes looking at.I want him staring right at us at the end.
Theres a style for the draw on these spotsand its stop, inhale, 1,000-yard stare.
Tell me what you think.
I think youre the clientand we should do what you want.
- It can make people very uncomfortable.- Walter Cronkite does it every night.
Lets take a risk together,shall we, Sally?
Going again. This time, Nathaniel,on the draw, look right in the lens.
Its Wednesday, September 4th,and currently 64 degrees in Manhattan.
We have to get a pencil case.
- Whats wrong with your pencil box?- How was the first day?
I wish I couldve found the camera,
just so we could see the differenceon your face
from when you left this morningto when I picked you up.
- So, you like your teacher?- Shes okay.
Its Mrs. Patton. All they do is draw.
Is this todays mail?
- Ill get him.- Would you?
Youre so quiet. You must be tired.
Im not tired. I really want a pencil caseto put in my loose-leaf.
Well see.
Lucky Strike, the hard-working smokewith that smooth and honest taste.
- Cut.- So, its a rhythm?
Thats true. Obviously, itll sound betterwith the announcers voice.
It sounded like you had a half a pastramiin your mouth.
Its a scratch track. I didnt knowyou were gonna show it to the client.
I know Im supposed to stay awaytill the screening,
but I am fascinated by this process.
Youre thinking about getting outof cigarettes and into the movies?
Not while my fathers alive.
Well, if we rerecord the sound tonight,we can probably finish this.
I heard you the first time.Ill be in the booth.
Id appreciate it if youd forgetall that nonsense I was saying before.
- What are you talking about?- The movies, my father.
- Forgotten.- Sorry, but I had a long, wet lunch.
- Really? Too much to drink.- And other things.
Secretaries nowadays,they dont give you a choice.
You know what I mean?
- I dont have a secretary.- Howd my sh*t turn out?
Im not sure. I think its gonna feel strange.
Lucky Strike has a way of doing things.Look at this.
Yeah, see? I dont think thats so bad.
Come on. Hes not coming back for a while.
Ill lock the door.
- Im married.- So am I.
- Theres been a misunderstanding.- I know what I know.
Jerry should have the tracks done.
You can see the whole thing tomorrowor when its done.
Ill probably be busy tomorrow.
I got it. Youre at work. Thats too bad.
- How about a nasty old alligator?- He has a point.
Down, Sue. Ill handle this.
"Henry, Im so pleased theres a placethat I can write to you.
"The children are finallyback in school now, and I must admit
"that I like the idea of looking forwardto the mails arrival every day.
"Well, not every day. Ha, ha.
"I dont write many letters anymore,so I apologize in advance
"if Im unable to accuratelyexpress my thoughts.
"But I do have thoughts,
"and I suppose I wonder too muchwhere you are and what youre doing.
"Weve only met three times,you know that? Isnt that strange?
"I wish I had a clearer picture of youin my mind.
"Anyway, thats all I have to report.I hope to hear from you. B."
Dont touch it.
- Ive seen this one. It whitens.- Its not about what you want to watch.
I have to make surethey run every commercial.
...pillowcases, socks, towels, everything.
My mother-in-law saysI look like Perry Mason.
Its not a compliment.It means she thinks youre fat.
- Crane.- Harry, its Lee Garner.
I knew youd still be there.
- You work hard, dont you?- For you? You bet.
Look, I dont want to keep you,but I have a bit of a problem.
- Whats wrong?- Its that Salvatore fellow, the director.
Hes no good. Id like him gone.
- What happened?- Well, I cant work with him. Get rid of him.
- Well, I cant do that.- Excuse me?
No, Im not really... I cant.Pete and Roger handle your account.
No, no. No, no, no, Harry.I want you to take care of this,
and I want you to keep it just between us.
Crane, you there?
Listen, Lee. I hope you knowthe commercials turning out beautiful.
- You really have an eye, you know.- I do, do I?
- Are you enjoying the city?- I am. Plenty to do.
Well, you have a good night.I should get back to work.
- Sorry to trouble you. Good night.- Good night.
- What was that?- You dont want to know.
- I think I do.- I cant tell you.
Now I really do.
- Lee Garner Jr. Asked me to get rid of Sal.- Whatd he do?
I didnt ask. He was drunk as a skunkand hes scary to begin with.
What are you gonna do, call Campbell?
Thats the other thing.He said to keep it between us.
What are you gonna do?
Im not gonna panicand do something stupid like I usually do.
- Thats a good start.- I cant really do anything, can I?
He was really drunk.
The shows on.
Great, I missed all the commercials.
- Hello?- Don, its Conrad Hilton.
Is it?
Now, dont be like that.I know its a privilege to call you at home.
I dont think Ive worn it out. Its 11:30.
- Its not a problem, Connie.- Can you come have a drink with me?
- Right now?- You can say no. Ive heard it before.
And for all you know,youre not the first person I asked.
Ill be there.
Give me an hour.
Hello?
- So what is that, moonshine?- No, but it is from Prohibition.
I have two cases,and they both say "hair tonic" on the side.
I remember this.
I think you knowIm in a bit of a crisis tonight.
- I didnt know that.- I think about my business day and night.
And Im a harsh critic, especially of myself.
And sometimes it collects, and I feel bad.
And then I realizemaybe thats the reason Im so lonesome.
- You might be working too much.- Im not working enough.
Its my purpose in lifeto bring America to the world,
whether they like it or not.
You know, we are a force of good, Don,because we have God.
Communists dont.
Its their most important belief.Did you know that?
Im not an expert.
Generosity. The Marshall Plan,you remember that?
Everyone who saw our wayswanted to be us.
Im glad youre telling me this.
After all the things we threw at Khrushchev,you know what made him fall apart?
He couldnt get into Disneyland.
- Thats good.- You never heard that?
Well, I did, but when I hear you say it,it sounds beautiful.
I dont want any politics in my campaign.You know that.
But there should be...
Goodness, and confidence.
Thanks for listening to me, Don.
You know, sometimes I look around here,
and I think, "By golly, Im King Midas. "
Stop it. Youre not.
Youre my angel, you know that?Youre like a son.
In fact,sometimes youre more than a son to me
because you didnt have what they had,
and you understand.
Thank you.
I mean it.
Come in, come in, come in.
I drove all the way down to get the mail,and then I turned around and I debated it.
- I went past the exit a dozen times, and...- My girl is due back.
I know I shouldnt be here.
Its just, I wanted to see you.
I wasnt thinking.
- What do I say? Why are you here?- There you are.
Carla, this is Henry Francis.He works for Governor Rockefeller.
Its nice to meet you.
So anyway, I think this isan excellent venue for a fundraiser.
- Good. Ill have to check with my husband.- Of course.
Carla, will you show Mr. Francis out?I think I left the bath running.
- A pleasure to meet you.- You as well.
I cant get this. Lucy, do you mind?
Jesus, knock it off.
Its a Lucky Strike commercial.Its got three cuts in it.
So the hillbilly says, "That aint my finger. "
Im gonna have to hearthe beginning of that joke.
Lee? Lee!
- Whats going on?- I have no idea.
Does someone know whats going on?Speak up.
I know.
Lee Garner Jr. Called mea couple of days ago. Im sorry.
- Why is he calling you?- I dont know.
- He did, and he told me to get rid of Sal.- What?
And you made an executive decisionto do nothing?
He was really drunk.I thought it would blow over.
I didnt even think hed remember.
When you get in trouble,you call Mommy and Daddy.
He told me not to tell you,so what was I supposed to do?
Everyones an account man. What exactlydo you think we do here, Crane?
We handle clients.
- He wouldnt say a word. He just left.- Sal, youre fired.
- Are you serious?- Lee Garner Jr. Wants you fired.
Were gonna find outwhat he wants to do with you, imbecile.
- Oh, God.- What the hell happened?
What is going on?
Now, youre gonna use your dying breathto tell Don to fix this.
- Don?- Lee Garner has a problem with creative,
let Don solve it.He does it all now anyway. Now!
- What did Lee say to you?- Nothing. I have to talk to Don.
- Let me talk to Don.- Im doing as Im told. Is he busy?
I can see you and I can hear you.What do you want?
Who died?
- I screwed up with Lee Garner Jr.- What?
- How do I explain this?- He told Harry to fire me.
- Harry?- I didnt, but now Roger did.
- Roger did what?- He fired me.
Roger said to tell you to fix it.Those are his words.
Fantastic.
Thats a $25 million accountyou stuck your nose in, Crane.
Just get out.
What happened?
Lee Garner got drunk,and he told Harry to fire me,
and then Roger got angry and he did.I think if I get away from Lucky Strike
and lay low from Roger for a day or two,everything will be fine.
I understand what just happened.What happened with the cut?
- The commercials fine.- Sal, something mustve happened.
I cant help you unless you tell me.
- We had a misunderstanding.- Jesus. Im not gonna ask again.
He was drunk,and he cornered me in the editing room.
- Cornered you?- Yes.
And I backed him off,I told him I was married,
and he was embarrassed and he left.
- You mustve been really shocked.- I was, believe me.
But nothing happened,
because nothing could have happenedbecause youre married?
- Don, I swear on my mothers life.- You sure you want to do that?
Who do you think youre talking to?
I guess I was just supposed to dowhatever he wanted?
What if it was some girl?
That would depend on what kind of girlit was and what I knew about her.
You people.
I didnt do anything but turn him down.
Hes a bully.
Lucky Strike can shut off our lights.
I think you knowthat this is the way this has to be.
Youll do fine.
Get me Lee Garner Jr.
I said I dont want salad.
Watch your tone, young man.Carla works for me, not you.


- What do you want instead?- You might as well call it a day.
Okay. Thank you.
- Hi, Daddy.- Hi.
How was your day?
Not good.
I didnt want to bother you with it,but that man dropped by today
from the governors office. Carla met him.
Francine sent him over here.
They want to have a fundraiser,but her house isnt big enough.
I dont care, as long as I dont have to go.When is it?
Well, I should be going.
Soon. Next week, I think.
- A fundraiser for Rockefeller.- For the campaign.
- Im gonna go lay down. Good night, Carla.- Good night.
- Good night, children.- Good night.
Bye.
Good night, Mrs. Draper.
If youre here, do I have to be here?Because Im leaving.
- No, go ahead.- Good night, boss.
- Henry Francis.- Hello. I thought Id get the service.
This is Betty Draper.
I know that.Listen, I shouldnt have come by like that.
- I hope Im not calling too late.- No, youre not.
I checked with my husbandabout the fundraiser.
- The fundraiser?- Yes, wed be glad to do that.
Hows Tuesday the 17th?Can you make it then? Is that good for you?
Okay. I guessyoure going through with this.
I had to.
Ill have my girl call you tomorrowto make it official.
I look forward to it. Let me knowwhats usually provided by the host.
Sure.
Goodbye.
Good night, Betty.
Rome, Tehran, Tokyoare magnificent destinations,
and thats really been the focusof almost every campaign youve had
up till now.How to lure the American traveler abroad.
What more do we need than a pictureof Athens to get our hearts racing?
And yet the average Americanexperiences a level of luxury
that belongs only to kingsin most of the world.
Were not chauvinists.We just have expectations.
Well, now theres one word that promisesthe thrill of international travel
with the comfort of home. Hilton.
"How do you say ice waterin Italian? Hilton. "
"How do you say fresh towelsin Farsi? Hilton. "
"How do you say hamburgerin Japanese? Hilton. "
"Hilton. " Its the same in every language.
Maybe fried chicken. I dont likethe sound of "hamburger" and "Hilton. "
Besides, "hamburger"is already a foreign word.
Well see.
Its good. Very good.
Its clever, yet friendly. Draws you in.
But what about the moon?
- Excuse me?- Theres nothing about the moon.
Well, right now,thats not an actual destination.
That wasnt the point.I said I wanted Hilton on the moon.
I couldnt have been more clear about it.
Well, Ill admit I misunderstood that.Im sure theres a way to fit that into this.
Well, isnt this something?
Id like to speak with Don in private.
This is a good campaign, one of the best.
Its modern, its witty, its eye-catching.It will change your business.
Calm down.Im going to speak very honestly with you.
I dont think folks do that often.Probably scared.
Or they trust my work.
You want me to just say yesto everything you do?
Most ad men believe that clients arethe thing that gets in the way of good work.
Ive never experienced that.
You did not give me what I wanted.
Im deeply disappointed, Don.
This is a great campaign.
Fine. What do you want from me? Love?Your work is good.
But when I say I want the moon,I expect the moon.
- I said if he ran, Id support him.- I havent decided yet.
I voted for Kennedy.Ill probably vote for him again.
What a nice turnout.
- Wheres Henry Francis?- I dont know. Someones supposed to talk.
I dont know anything about Rockefeller.Thats why I did this.
Well, I want to knowhow hes gonna deal with the South.
Do you know how bad it must befor the negroes
to descend on Washington like thatjust to be heard?
Segregation is uncivilized. Its that simple.
You know what my father saysabout the South? "Its not 1963, its 1863."
Thank you.
Mrs. Draper, Im Elsa Kittridgeand I work with Mr. Francis.
Pleasure to meet you.I assume hes been delayed.
Actually he asked that I address the groupon behalf of the governor.
Thats disappointing.
I mean, I dont think its goingto help your fundraising
when you promise one thingand deliver another.
Well, perhaps youre right,
but he seemed to thinkI was a better match to the group,
and I am extremely informed.
In fact, Im the personwho briefs Mr. Francis.
I think youll see I wont embarrass youin front of your friends.
- Please, begin whenever you want.- No, you begin, dear.
Excuse me, my name is Betty Draper.Welcome to my home.
- Were going to listen to...- Elsa Kittridge,
Associate in the GovernorsInformation Office.
First I would like to dispel the rumor thatthere is a mandatory contribution tonight.
This is a taking of a pulse,an exchange of ideas.
Please see that were not disturbed.
Hey!
Mr. Francis, do you need anything?
- No, Marjorie, I dropped something.- Where were you last night?
- Calm down.- Why didnt you come?
Why did you send that woman?
- I watched the door all night like a sap.- Im sorry, but I wanted you to come to me.
- The ego.- Would you listen to me?
- You had to come to me.- And why is that?
Because youre married.
No, Henry.
Whats wrong?
Please. Were locked in this office.
What? On the desk? On the couch?
- We should get a room somewhere.- No.
Its tawdry.
Im sorry.
Im very sorry. I started this.
I dont know what you want.
Goodbye.
- Mr. Sterlings here to see you.- Send him in.
I heard Conrad Hilton left this buildingin a huff yesterday.
Who told you that?
Youve got your face so deep in Hiltonslap, youre ignoring everything else.
- Everythings under control.- You wont even let me meet the man.
What do you think accounts does,besides limit your brilliance?
Id tell you,but I dont want to hurt your feelings.
Keep joking about it.
Weve had two clients in one weekleave here angry. Important clients.
Is that what you want this placeto be known for?
That and some guy losing his footin a lawnmower?
I want to put you on notice,you are in over your head.
These children,
unoffending, innocent and beautiful,
were the v*ctimof one of the most vicious and tragic crimes
ever perpetrated against humanity.
You can leave it on your station.I dont mind.
- Its all right.- What was that?
The funeral servicefor the little girls in Birmingham.
Its so horrifying.
Are you okay? Do you need a day off?
No, Im fine. Thank you.
I hate to say this, but its reallymade me wonder about civil rights.
Maybe its not supposedto happen right now.
- Hello, Mr. Draper.- Hello.
You just missed bedtime.Theyre probably still awake.
No, dont bother with dinner.We got Chinese takeout.
Listen, Marty needs meto look over this work.
Dont wait up for me.
I love you, too.
Betts.
What?
Hilton just called. Im going in.
I didnt hear the phone.
Go back to sleep.
- Someones going to see you.- Then let me in.
This is nice.
What can I do for you?
I dont know. I wanted to talk.
Right. Says the manas he unbuckles his pants.
What do you want me to say?Youve been flirting with me for months.
- So what?- So, I cant stop thinking about you.
Because Im new and different.Or maybe Im exactly the same.
Tell me youve run past that stretchof highway in the past two weeks
and not thought of me,
not looked for me.
But then I have the luxuryof that last half-mile home
where I go through every step of the futureuntil it ends.
I know exactly how it ends.
So what?
You live two miles from here.Your daughter was my student.
Ive seen your wife in the market.
I dont thinkyouve done this before this way.
I want you.
I dont care. Doesnt that mean anythingto someone like you?
