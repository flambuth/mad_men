I need your license and registration
And I need to know what you were doing.
Im driving.
Dont get smart with me.
Weve been looking for you.
Theres been a mistake.
You knew wed catch up with you eventually.
( truck rumbling )
I cant find any baking soda.
Were gonna have to make do with colgate.
On my arm?
Well, youre back early.
Well, we had to skip lunch.
- Hello, sherry. - Hello.
I got stinged.
Oh, sweetheart.
We were up at lyman orchards. Its mostly bees.
Daddy put toothpaste on it.
Yes, and youre no worse for wear.
Not allergic, thankfully.
Im terribly so.
I have an hour. I suppose we could still grab lunch.
No, this is fine. She should probably rest.
Ill see you Thursday, wonder woman.
Well go to friendlys.
Well, Im off.
Go inside and lay down, sweetheart.
Every time bill has the kids,
Something terrible happens.
( laughs )
The incredible thing is I make her lunch,
I take her to school, I read to her every night,
And he spends Sunday and Thursday night with her
And thats all I hear about.
Well, I admire you.
Are you trying to get me to make you lunch?
No, I think its admirable
That you havent poisoned her against him.
I dont know if I could have that restraint.
Yes, you would.
Because youd be concerned about your child
And do your best to forget things.
And not expect your friends to remind you all the time.
I am so sorry.
That is not what I was trying to say.
I know.
Would you like some of these?
So what happened to field hockey?
If Im on the yearbook, I wont be a benchwarmer.
Well, can you quit before I buy you cleats and a stick next time?
Im going to sell everything.
You know how much madrids going to cost?
Im not gonna back out of that.
I want to go to Spain.
I want to go to Spain.
You think itll be more interesting than wyoming?
I dont know. Wyoming had a two-headed cow.
Youll see it on the postcard.
So wheres next?
Well, Im in kansas right now.
Im going to take route 35.
Then over on 40.
Then 89 to the grand canyon.
I feel like Im sitting right next to you.
( chuckles )
Is it cold yet?
A little. I wouldnt rush home.
Well, I want to get your brothers before they go to sleep.
Ill call you next week.
I really want you to sell that equipment.
You have no idea about money.
I will. Bye.
Bye, sweetheart.
( bell tolling )
Are you lost?
No, Im a student here.
Well, see you around.
Oh!
Hey, give her some room.
You okay, lady?
Just my pride. New shoes.
I think I need a minute.
( exhales )
Duck, how are you?
Fit as a fiddle, thank you.
28th? Thats top brass.
Actually, its none of your business.
Dont be coy. Youre helping them replace don, arent you?
- Ive done it before. - ( elevator bell dings )
Is it true he left behind a couple million bucks?
( elevator bell dings )
Nice to see you.
Actually, let me ask you something.
Morning, john, norm.
One month and youre already the mayor.
Theyve been very hospitable.
Of course I delivered everyone.
I even brought burger chef back.
And after joan cashed in, I saved avon.
There have been whispers about coca-cola.
No need to impress me.
What do you want?
Not here.
This will just take a moment, sarah.
You cant be in here.
Everyones going to think Im looking for a job.
You mind?
They should always think youre unhappy.
Youre wrong. And for the first time, they dont.
Now go outside and tell everyone you staggered into the wrong office.
- Theyll believe you. - Look, this isnt about you.
Ive been trying to get this private aviation company
To have me do all their hiring.
But before any of that happens,
They want to review their overall strategy.
So I want you to go to dinner and recommend
That they hire an in-house senior marketing man.
And Im the guy to find him.
Because youre the best?
Yes.
And then you can extoll the wonders of mccann.
Everybody wins.
I dont need to poach.
You know, I helped you for free after that stupid merger.
And then you sent peggy to gerald whats-his-name when she was in need.
This is how I make my living, pete.
Ive paid you at some point.
Youd want this business if you knew you couldnt have it.
Learjet is private, luxury air travel.
Look, pete, I just have to fill this one position
And Ill make it through the winter.
For old times sake.
( scoffs ) fine. Who is he?
His name is mike sherman and he moved to wichita from philly four years ago.
Princeton 52. You should have a lot in common.
Im dartmouth 56.
I know that.
Dont pretend like youre not gonna jack each other off.
- Sarah. - Yes, mr. Campbell?
Would you remind me that I need to make a donation to lincoln center?
Mr. Phillips was very persuasive.
Thank you for your generosity.
Man on radio: Koma, fun-loving 1520.
- The capital radio... - ( engine thumping )
...For the capital city, oklahoma city, oklahoma.
( jingle plays )
Shit.
Radio: Look for clear skies with a high temperature today of 75.
A pleasant day here in this pleasant city.
Current temperature is 73.
Beautiful weather out there today.
Dr. Buckley will be right with you, mrs. Robinson.
Its mrs. Francis.
Oh, the boys who dropped you off said that was your name.
I think that was a joke.
Oh.
Nurse, could you excuse us?
Mrs. Francis, is it possible to get your husband down here?
I can drive with a broken rib.
Its not even that sore.
Well, I took a look at your x-ray
And it may be more serious than just the rib.
How serious?
You can use the phone at the nurses station.
Im gonna sue them.
First Im gonna go through the health commission
And Im gonna look into their funding.
That quack has some nerve scaring you like that.
What happens to my car?
Ill send my secretary up here in a cab tomorrow morning.
And Im gonna call-- call-- call jim.
Call--
You know what?
Ill just call rockys office. Thats what Im gonna do.
Henry, I want to go home.
Babe, look at me.
Youre gonna be just fine.
( engine starts )
Afternoon.
Wyatt called from the service station.
Weve got our best available for you.
If you threw a rod, its gonna take some time.
Its the rocker arm.
Well, Ive got a weekly for $37 or a daily for six.
Lets take it a night at a time.
Im an optimist.
Oh, hello.
This is my wife sharon.
Of the sharon motel.
This is donald from new york.
- Don. - Pleasure to have you with us.
Do you know where I could get a meal?
Theres a cafe a couple of miles up the road.
Hes got car trouble.
Well, I made a roast.
Howd you like leftovers as room service?
I dont want you to go to the trouble.
Do you have vending machines?
You can have both.
Give him some change and have andy take his luggage.
This is all I got.
Heres two dimes and a nickel.
There you go.
I believe thats one of the best steaks Ive ever had.
Well, its the best because they flew it out from kansas.
Isnt wichita cattle country?
It sure is.
But I was disappointed when I got there
That I didnt see more ten-gallon hats.
( chuckles ) but your company is very glamorous.
As far as I can tell, its entire public reputation is based on hollywood.
Well, we thought wed go with our most exciting customers.
Elizabeth taylor. Danny kaye.
Somebody you want to meet?
Not really.
In fact, I think thats the problem if you have one.
I have one, or I wouldnt be talking to you.
Corporate executives should be your core business.
You can read that without glasses?
Ive looked at your business and I think ducks right.
You need a senior marketing executive.
And not just anyone.
You need someone comfortable
With the kind of boardroom leaders that see learjet as a tool,
Not a frivolous extravagance for movie stars and their pets.
( laughs )
Mccann could run circles around carson roberts.
But we wouldnt even be interested
Unless duck found the right man for your company.
I dont understand.
Are you advocating for your agency or for yourself?
Were one and the same.
Well, the jobs are not one and the same.
You cant work for mccann and work for us.
Im aware of that.
But I couldnt agree with you more about who we need.
I told duck I was looking for a real knickerbocker.
Right schools, right family.
Someone who can rap his ring on the table
And let everyone know theyre with a friend.
Well, Im flattered.
But Im afraid duck phillips has tricked me into a job interview.
I stand by my analysis,
But Im very happy where I am.
I expect him to lie to me.
I didnt expect him to lie to you.
Im glad we got to meet.
Likewise. Thats never a mistake.
You want a brandy?
Because ducks going to get the check.
( laughs )
Doctor: Well, unfortunately, weve discovered
That the cancer has spread from the lung
And metastasized to the bones
And to lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
Henry: I dont understand what youre saying.
Its aggressive and its very advanced.
I wish there was better news.
What do we do?
Well, Im going to recommend a radiation oncologist
For therapy to help mend the rib.
It wont heal without it. Then a medical oncologist.
She could have nine months to a year,
But these treatments are usually palliative.
Im so sorry.
Cking )
Oh, sorry about that.
You should put the sign out.
Youre the maid?
And the messenger.
I guess they didnt know you were in here.
Wyatt called. Its a bushing on the rocker arm,
But its got to come from tulsa.
So Im gonna need another book.
The chlorines k*ll the piss in the pool by now.
You can go for a swim.
Anything else to do around here?
( sighs )
Theres football at the high school Friday night.
Revival church every night.
Fairviews got a drive-in,
But you dont have a car.
Where can I get a drink?
Thats a little complicated.
But I probably can rustle up a bottle.
Thatd be great.
Andy.
You want me to clean up?
Don. Maybe tomorrow.
- Man: There she is. - ( kids laughing )
Man: Dont run.
Im in grand central. Come down.
Only to throw you under a train.
Come on.
I only have one question.
I better have gotten that lousy job.
You did, and its not lousy.
I havent even negotiated, were already at 100 a year.
All benefits and unlimited private jet travel.
Its a flying limousine, pete.
You can have lunch in new york and be back for dinner.
Good, because I live here. I have to go.
- He wants to have dinner with wives. - No.
Hes only meeting with you and one other guy.
Two last-round dinners.
Help me turn it into a horse race.
How many times do you think you can lie to this man?
We both told him you didnt want the job. Whats the lie?
Well, for one thing, I dont have a wife.
For the other, I have four years left
On my contract with mccann
And a million dollars contingent on my presence.
Uh-huh, so now we know theres a price.
( chuckles ) youre talking to yourself.
Have dinner. Yuck it up.
Dont you want to sign him one day?
You know the corporate royalty on those planes?
7:30 Saturday.
Grill room at the four seasons.
Your wifes under the weather, but you didnt want to miss it.
Theres two guys. Hy epstein wants to start treatment immediately
And hes conducting a study at new york hospital.
The other one--
Cant read my own writing.
Hes a surgeon. Very aggressive.
But hes in bethesda.
Stop brushing your hair. Hows the rib gonna heal?
My ribs not going to heal, henry.
You cant waste any more time being in shock.
- You have to do something. - Do what?
What do you think would happen if nelson rockefeller got this?
He would die!
Betty, do you want the kids to hear you talk that way?
I dont want them to hear anything until Ive decided what to tell them.
Thats whats on my mind, henry.
Do you want to help with that, or do you want to keep chasing your tail?
Youre being morose.
Youre a very lucky woman. You have been your whole life.
Stop yelling at me.
( knocking on door )
Thanks for the books.
Its $10.
I gave you $10.
It was hard to get.
( scoffs )
Im not paying $20 for a bottle of whiskey
And a couple of paperbacks somebody left behind.
Youve got the money.
I walked into town. And its hard for me.
I got flatfeet.
- You want one? - No, sir.
Im one-eighth comanche. Cant ever touch it.
Folks know the hustle youre running out of their motel?
My folks are over in woodward.
And aint none of their business how I get rich.
Thats true.
Howd you get rich?
I was in the advertising business.
You make commercials on tv?
Lots of them.
So many you dont have to work no more?
Anymore.
All right. Well, Im around.
Dont forget to take the pie tammy made you.
( tv playing )
Sorry to bother you, but my tv just died.
Oh, well, well get you a new one.
Soon as Im done fighting this battle.
"harbor lights" playing
There you go.
Then it comes loose.
( dings )
- Youre the quick brown fox. - ( chuckles )
Did you learn to type in the army?
No, night school.
Were you in the service?
Yes.
Well, everybody whos a vet and likes drinking
Will be at the legion on Saturday night.
My husband would be tickled if you joined him.
Why didnt he ask me?
Oh, hes gonna. Soon as he spies a chance.
He could sure use someone new to tell his stories to.
I dont know that Ill be here,
Unless you know something about my car that I dont.
Wyatts gonna overcharge you, but hell get the work done.
Lets get that tv
So you can get back to relaxing.
( distant train horn blaring )
Hello?
The whole pie is for you.
Eat with me.
There were two pies.
Im not gonna tell you what happened to the other one.
I have a favor to ask of you.
I can repay you.
Ill take her for a weekend next month. You can go away.
What?
I have a dinner with a potential client
And Id love for you to join me.
No.
Thankfully, thats no longer one of my obligations.
You used to love it.
I daresay it got you excited trying to close over coffee.
I never closed anything.
I was just trying to stay awake.
Trudy, you understand my business.
No one else ever really has.
Well, Im not comfortable being your date under any circumstances.
Well, then,
How about for old times sake?
You know, Im jealous of your ability
To be sentimental about the past.
Im not able to do that.
I remember things as they were.
Its late.
Id like to turn off the lights.
Well, good night, then.
Good night.
Because she got kicked out of brearley.
- ( screams ) - hold on. Easy.
What are you doing here?
Youre not supposed to be in here.
Could you leave us alone, sweetheart?
Oh, of course.
Come have a seat.
I have some serious news.
Its bad news.
Your mother is sick.
She has lung cancer and its very advanced.
Im very sorry.
Ive got to call her.
She doesnt want you kids to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because theres hope she could have more time.
People do. Its a tough road, but its a chance.
Well, thats good.
But she wont do it.
I dont know if shes just being stubborn or vain,
But she wont even hear of it.
Henry, my ears are still buzzing.
I dont understand you.
I breached her confidence because I want you
To talk some sense into her.
Shell listen to you.
I wouldnt know what to say.
Its okay for you to cry, honey.
( crying )
Jesus, what am I going to do?
Hows she running?
Good as new.
I suppose youre gonna be on your way, then.
I should settle up.
Sure I cant talk you into joining us tonight?
I should get going.
Mister, I know youre not in a rush.
We got plenty of tourists with cars in the shop.
You made two phone calls in six days.
Wyatt thought you ran away.
I dont know.
Tell you what.
Ill throw in the room tonight
And Ill give you another night if you fix the coke machine.
I dont think I can help you with that.
I know you were right about your car.
And sharon said she caught you being handy.
Dont they fix it?
They want to give me a new one,
But I like this one. Ill get my tools.
Henry: Hello?
Smells good.
I brought you a surprise.
Betty.
What are you doing here?
I got in trouble at school again.
Whatd you do?
I dont want to talk about it.
Are we supposed to eat?
Genie, come over here.
"I like to dance the swedish waltz" playing
So, Im going to tell you in advance
That I know we seem like fine people,
But Ive been a little dishonest.
Okay.
This is a fundraiser
For al bettendorf over there.
His house b*rned down. Well, the kitchen.
The most expensive room.
Theres a fine jar.
Were just strangers, but it does include barbecue
And Im getting your drinks.
$40 for don!
( cheering )
Whats your rank and where did you serve?
7th infantry. Korea.
Rank?
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, 7th infantry, korea.
Man: Shit, we should be paying him.
( men laugh )
Thats $5 for swearing.
What are you drinking?
( sighs )
Ill just have the shrimp cocktail.
Well, as mother used to say, "youre not that fat."
( laughs )
No, I have a-- well, something came up.
Since I invited you?
Youre always complaining we never see each other.
Then I ask you to dinner, miss a very important meeting,
And you have other plans?
It was very short notice.
If you need an alibi, youre going to have to ask.
Please.
Now, what did you want to talk about?
Let me ask you something.
How do you know when somethings really an opportunity?
Im wrong sometimes,
But the girls arent shy nowadays.
( chuckles ) no, I meant in your career.
Oh. Well, in banking theres a road and you just stay on it.
Still, youre required to assess risk.
Pete, I dont buy or sell anything.
I just distribute and its never up to me.
Fine, forget your business.
Youre taking a risk tonight.
So now youre jealous and youre trying to ruin my evening.
Your wife knows.
Im not asking you to imagine it,
Im telling you she knows.
And how do you feel now that you know that?
Judys always loved that I was attractive to other women.
Its part of what she likes about me.
Im just supposed to turn that off?
Youre not supposed to act on it.
But I always have. Thats the way we are.
But why? Always looking for something better.
Always looking for something else.
Because dad was like that.
He really was, wasnt he?
You know, once at the polo grounds,
Some jeweler thanked him profusely for buying a diamond necklace.
Dad got very cross and called off the sale right in front of me.
He kept muttering how the man was indiscreet.
I looked it up.
I didnt need any detective work.
I just saw the way women looked at him.
You really think she knows?
I think it feels good and then it doesnt.
( sighs ) I have to make a phone call.
Dont listen to me.
Ill be right back.
And waynes dad ran the drugstore before wayne.
He was all 10 commandments rolled into one.
( laughs )
He caught us smoking, stealing, cussing.
My wife went to high school with these two.
They were hooligans.
I didnt break the real commandments till I was in europe.
Were you in europe, don?
Don was in korea.
You dont just need new glasses, you need a new hearing aid.
Well, he hasnt said anything.
Did you introduce him to--
Hey, jerry! Jerry fandango!
Get over here.
Jerry served in korea.
So, you know, maybe youve seen him before.
What the ( inaudible ) do you farts want?
- Gerald fanning, this is-- - don was in korea.
You two can reminisce.
I dont want to talk about it.
Jerry fanning. Pfc, 34th infantry.
Come on, let me see your face.
When and where?
It was before they called it a w*r. Near the yalu river.
Oh, hell.
I wasnt there till christmas 53.
I was home by then.
Have a seat.


No, I got one.
Tell you one thing about korea.
They can keep it.
( drums b*at )
( drumroll )
( cheering )
( whistling )
( cheering )
( drums playing )
( tv playing )
( banging on door )
( banging )
Go away.
Duck: What the hell happened to you?
You stood me up.
Get in here.
I never said I would go.
You did, and mike was waiting with charlene at the grill room
For an hour!
For heavens sake, youre drunk.
And youre being very menacing right now.
Im happy. Listen to me.
Youre on a streak.
Youre on one of those magic--
We used to call it a trend.
You know, because of the graph where the line just goes up.
I dont know what youre talking about.
Mike called me from his hotel room.
He was pretty sore.
So I told him that you wanted to come,
But you were insulted by the offer.
- You what? - He wants to do it all.
Company car, company plane, signing bonus.
And hes gonna get you out of mccann.
Hes gonna give me a million dollars?
Hes gonna get very close with stock options
And mccanns gonna cut a deal for the rest
Because youre gonna help them.
Learjets a tiny account. Its peanuts to them.
Youre not the client. Your passengers are.
Jim hobarts very excited about who flies on those planes.
Every important ceo in america.
You talked to jim hobart?
You know what $100 buys you in wichita?
A two-bedroom house.
You stupid wino.
Youre going to destroy everything!
Whos going to win the world series this year?
I dont know.
You are! ( laughs )
Because you are charmed, my friend.
Good night, duck.
Ive been there. It doesnt last long.
So the doctor says, "sorry, son,
But your peckers got gangrene.
Were gonna have to amputate."
( laughs )
So the gi goes to the jap doctor.
"oh, good news. No need to amputate.
In three days will fall off by itself."
( laughing )
To don!
For being generous and not saying shit.
I dont know that many jokes.
Oh, just leave him alone.
Don, youre not allowed to say,
"I dont want to talk about it" in this place.
Thats why I never joined.
Youre not listening to me.
Youre among friends.
Floyd, tell him.
- Floyd! - What?
Tell him about the hurtgen forest.
Give me a drink.
Tell him the story first.
( sighs ) oh, shit.
You know where it is?
Its on the border between belgium and germany.
( sighs )
We were cut off.
Three of us.
Actually...
There were nine of us originally.
( sighs )
We came on a machine g*n nest.
There were four krauts in there looking to surrender.
They had their hands in the air with their papers.
They were starving. Dont skip that.
We were starving.
Scrounging for grub.
We were boiling bark.
So theres three of us,
Four of them,
And more snow coming.
You did what you had to do.
What did you do?
Someone made them start digging.
And we bounced them.
One at a time.
Took a couple of hours.
One of them was so skinny, he tried to run away,
His pants fell down.
You know they all got blue eyes.
You just do what you have to do to come home.
I k*ll my co.
We were under fire.
Fuel was everywhere.
And I dropped my lighter.
And I blew him apart.
And I got to go home.
That is the name of the game.
Hey, where is that kid?
We need a bottle over here!
Over here!
- Over here! - ( men laughing )
¶ get that kid with the booze over here... ¶
( chuckles )
¶ cause the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere ¶
¶ over there, over there ¶
¶ send the word, send the word over there ¶
¶ cause the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere... ¶
( door opens )
- Did I wake you? - No.
Henry shouldnt have scared you.
I wanted to tell you myself.
He doesnt know you wont get treatment
Because you love the tragedy.
( sighs ) sally, Ive learned
To believe people when they tell you its over.
They dont want to say it, so its usually the truth.
Henry said you could have a year.
And what would that year be like?
Ill be with you.
I wont let you give up.
I know that.
But I watched my mother die.
I wont do that to you.
And I dont want you to think Im a quitter.
I fought for plenty in my life.
Thats how I know when its over.
Its not a weakness.
Its been a gift to me.
To know when to move on.
These are instructions.
Open it the minute you know Im gone.
- No. - Listen to me.
Things happen very quickly when people die.
Henrys not going to be able to handle things.
Youre going back to school in the morning.
I dont want you alarming your brothers.
Go back to sleep.
- ( footsteps ) - ( voices whispering )
( keys rattling )
What the hell?
We want our money.
What?
We know you took the money.
Let me go! Sharon, whats going on?
Your car was fixed. You should have been on your way.
Now, I dont know who the hell you are,
But youve got five mississippi to get our money back.
I didnt take your money.
You threw all that money around
cause you knew youd get it back.
( grunts )
I mean business!
You really think I need your spare change?
Give us the cash and you can have your car back.
- Probably stolen. - Well find out.
( door closes )
( knocking )
My god, whats wrong?
I need to speak with you.
My goodness, its 4:00 in the morning.
Is everything all right?
Youre scaring me. Please, what is it?
Its good news. Catch your breath.
( exhales ) what on earth is going on?
I was offered a job tonight.
Because its origins were supernatural,
I realized that its benefits might be as well.
I want you and tammy to come with me.
I want you to relocate to wichita, pick out a house,
And be my wife and family again.
Peter, Im not dismissing you...
Im saying with respect to whatever
Is happening in your eyes right now,
We both know things cant be undone.
Says who?
Were not even through half our lives.
And even if we are, were entitled to more.
Of what?
Then were entitled to something new.
I want to start over.
And I know I can.
Im not so dumb anymore.
Im not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.
You never lost it.
But I will never allow you to hurt me again.
I love you, too.
I always have.
Ive never loved anyone else.
Never.
( sighs )
You think you can come in here
When Im all disoriented
And say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago
And make me run away with you?
I said it to you 10 years ago and Ill say it again.
I do.
Wichita is beautiful.
And wholesome.
And not the city and not cos cob.
And youll have a plane to use at your disposal.
We will.
To pick up and go anywhere anytime we want.
Like driving to montauk.
I want to go everywhere with you.
Say yes with your voice, not just your eyes.
Oh!
( breathing heavily )
How will I explain this to tammy?
Tell her her birthday wish came true.
Im gonna go.
And were gonna have dinner on Saturday night.
The three of us.
Like it was the first time.
Good morning.
( knocking )
This ones on the house.
What do you want to know? You want to know what I told them?
Im just being a good citizen, man.
You dont know anything about me. I could k*ll you right now.
You took that money and you set me up.
I dont know what youre talking about.
You have shitty instincts for a con man.
Youre lucky you feel guilty.
Thats the one difference between you and those animals right now.
I dont feel guilty taking that drunks money.
He b*rned his own house down.
He doesnt deserve a pot to piss in, let alone 500 bucks.
Youre gonna get me that money,
Pack your bag, and get out of town.
I cant leave without that money.
I know you think you know how to hustle,
But this is a big crime, stealing these peoples money.
If you keep it, youll have to become somebody else.
And its not what you think it is.
You cannot get off on that foot in this life.
What do you care?
You got money. I know you got money.
I cleaned your room and didnt take nothing.
Anything.
You think this town is bad now?
Wait until you can never come back.
Can I go?
Go get the money.
Im not paying for the room.
Could you drop me off at the bus stop?
( sighs )
Get in.
Im off.
- Where are you going? - I have class.
Why are you doing that?
Why was I ever doing it?
( sighs )
Bettys voice: "dear sally,
I know that youre frightened
And there are many decisions I cant prepare you for,
But you must immediately tell the hospital
And the funeral director that Im to be interred intact
In the family plot in west laurel.
Uncle william has the details from grandpa genes burial.
Ive also enclosed a portrait
From the 1968 republican winter gala.
The blue chiffon I wore is my very favorite.
I hung it in a gold garment bag in the hall closet beside the mink.
Please bring them the lipstick from my handbag
And remind them how I like to wear my hair.
Will you show them the picture?
Sally, I always worried about you
Because you March to the b*at of your own drum.
But now I know thats good.
I know your life will be an adventure."
( girls laughing )
Bettys voice: "I love you. Mom."
( crying )
( turns off engine )
Pink slips in the glove box.
What?
Dont waste this.
( starts engine )
