I need your license and registration
And I need to know what you were doing.
I'm driving.
Don't get smart with me.
We've been looking for you.
There's been a mistake.
You knew we'd catch up with you eventually.
( truck rumbling )
I can't find any baking soda.
We're gonna have to make do with colgate.
On my arm?
Well, you're back early.
Well, we had to skip lunch.
- Hello, sherry. - Hello.
I got stinged.
Oh, sweetheart.
We were up at lyman orchards. It's mostly bees.
Daddy put toothpaste on it.
Yes, and you're no worse for wear.
Not allergic, thankfully.
I'm terribly so.
I have an hour. I suppose we could still grab lunch.
No, this is fine. She should probably rest.
I'll see you Thursday, wonder woman.
We'll go to friendly's.
Well, I'm off.
Go inside and lay down, sweetheart.
Every time bill has the kids,
Something terrible happens.
( laughs )
The incredible thing is I make her lunch,
I take her to school, I read to her every night,
And he spends Sunday and Thursday night with her
And that's all I hear about.
Well, I admire you.
Are you trying to get me to make you lunch?
No, I think it's admirable
That you haven't poisoned her against him.
I don't know if I could have that restraint.
Yes, you would.
Because you'd be concerned about your child
And do your best to forget things.
And not expect your friends to remind you all the time.
I am so sorry.
That is not what I was trying to say.
I know.
Would you like some of these?
So what happened to field hockey?
If I'm on the yearbook, I won't be a benchwarmer.
Well, can you quit before I buy you cleats and a stick next time?
I'm going to sell everything.
You know how much madrid's going to cost?
I'm not gonna back out of that.
I want to go to Spain.
I want to go to Spain.
You think it'll be more interesting than wyoming?
I don't know. Wyoming had a two-headed cow.
You'll see it on the postcard.
So where's next?
Well, I'm in kansas right now.
I'm going to take route 35.
Then over on 40.
Then 89 to the grand canyon.
I feel like I'm sitting right next to you.
( chuckles )
Is it cold yet?
A little. I wouldn't rush home.
Well, I want to get your brothers before they go to sleep.
I'll call you next week.
I really want you to sell that equipment.
You have no idea about money.
I will. Bye.
Bye, sweetheart.
( bell tolling )
Are you lost?
No, I'm a student here.
Well, see you around.
Oh!
Hey, give her some room.
You okay, lady?
Just my pride. New shoes.
I think I need a minute.
( exhales )
Duck, how are you?
Fit as a fiddle, thank you.
28th? That's top brass.
Actually, it's none of your business.
Don't be coy. You're helping them replace don, aren't you?
- I've done it before. - ( elevator bell dings )
Is it true he left behind a couple million bucks?
( elevator bell dings )
Nice to see you.
Actually, let me ask you something.
Morning, john, norm.
One month and you're already the mayor.
They've been very hospitable.
Of course I delivered everyone.
I even brought burger chef back.
And after joan cashed in, I saved avon.
There have been whispers about coca-cola.
No need to impress me.
What do you want?
Not here.
This will just take a moment, sarah.
You can't be in here.
Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.
You mind?
They should always think you're unhappy.
You're wrong. And for the first time, they don't.
Now go outside and tell everyone you staggered into the wrong office.
- They'll believe you. - Look, this isn't about you.
I've been trying to get this private aviation company
To have me do all their hiring.
But before any of that happens,
They want to review their overall strategy.
So I want you to go to dinner and recommend
That they hire an in-house senior marketing man.
And I'm the guy to find him.
Because you're the best?
Yes.
And then you can extoll the wonders of mccann.
Everybody wins.
I don't need to poach.
You know, I helped you for free after that stupid merger.
And then you sent peggy to gerald what's-his-name when she was in need.
This is how I make my living, pete.
I've paid you at some point.
You'd want this business if you knew you couldn't have it.
Learjet is private, luxury air travel.
Look, pete, I just have to fill this one position
And I'll make it through the winter.
For old times' sake.
( scoffs ) fine. Who is he?
His name is mike sherman and he moved to wichita from philly four years ago.
Princeton '52. You should have a lot in common.
I'm dartmouth '56.
I know that.
Don't pretend like you're not gonna jack each other off.
- Sarah. - Yes, mr. Campbell?
Would you remind me that I need to make a donation to lincoln center?
Mr. Phillips was very persuasive.
Thank you for your generosity.
Man on radio: Koma, fun-loving 1520.
- The capital radio... - ( engine thumping )
...For the capital city, oklahoma city, oklahoma.
( jingle plays )
Shit.
Radio: Look for clear skies with a high temperature today of 75.
A pleasant day here in this pleasant city.
Current temperature is 73.
Beautiful weather out there today.
Dr. Buckley will be right with you, mrs. Robinson.
It's mrs. Francis.
Oh, the boys who dropped you off said that was your name.
I think that was a joke.
Oh.
Nurse, could you excuse us?
Mrs. Francis, is it possible to get your husband down here?
I can drive with a broken rib.
It's not even that sore.
Well, I took a look at your x-ray
And it may be more serious than just the rib.
How serious?
You can use the phone at the nurses' station.
I'm gonna sue them.
First I'm gonna go through the health commission
And I'm gonna look into their funding.
That quack has some nerve scaring you like that.
What happens to my car?
I'll send my secretary up here in a cab tomorrow morning.
And I'm gonna call-- call-- call jim.
Call--
You know what?
I'll just call rocky's office. That's what I'm gonna do.
Henry, I want to go home.
Babe, look at me.
You're gonna be just fine.
( engine starts )
Afternoon.
Wyatt called from the service station.
We've got our best available for you.
If you threw a rod, it's gonna take some time.
It's the rocker arm.
Well, I've got a weekly for $37 or a daily for six.
Let's take it a night at a time.
I'm an optimist.
Oh, hello.
This is my wife sharon.
Of the sharon motel.
This is donald from new york.
- Don. - Pleasure to have you with us.
Do you know where I could get a meal?
There's a cafe a couple of miles up the road.
He's got car trouble.
Well, I made a roast.
How'd you like leftovers as room service?
I don't want you to go to the trouble.
Do you have vending machines?
You can have both.
Give him some change and have andy take his luggage.
This is all I got.
Here's two dimes and a nickel.
There you go.
I believe that's one of the best steaks I've ever had.
Well, it's the best because they flew it out from kansas.
Isn't wichita cattle country?
It sure is.
But I was disappointed when I got there
That I didn't see more ten-gallon hats.
( chuckles ) but your company is very glamorous.
As far as I can tell, its entire public reputation is based on hollywood.
Well, we thought we'd go with our most exciting customers.
Elizabeth taylor. Danny kaye.
Somebody you want to meet?
Not really.
In fact, I think that's the problem if you have one.
I have one, or I wouldn't be talking to you.
Corporate executives should be your core business.
You can read that without glasses?
I've looked at your business and I think duck's right.
You need a senior marketing executive.
And not just anyone.
You need someone comfortable
With the kind of boardroom leaders that see learjet as a tool,
Not a frivolous extravagance for movie stars and their pets.
( laughs )
Mccann could run circles around carson roberts.
But we wouldn't even be interested
Unless duck found the right man for your company.
I don't understand.
Are you advocating for your agency or for yourself?
We're one and the same.
Well, the jobs are not one and the same.
You can't work for mccann and work for us.
I'm aware of that.
But I couldn't agree with you more about who we need.
I told duck I was looking for a real knickerbocker.
Right schools, right family.
Someone who can rap his ring on the table
And let everyone know they're with a friend.
Well, I'm flattered.
But I'm afraid duck phillips has tricked me into a job interview.
I stand by my analysis,
But I'm very happy where I am.
I expect him to lie to me.
I didn't expect him to lie to you.
I'm glad we got to meet.
Likewise. That's never a mistake.
You want a brandy?
Because duck's going to get the check.
( laughs )
Doctor: Well, unfortunately, we've discovered
That the cancer has spread from the lung
And metastasized to the bones
And to lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
Henry: I don't understand what you're saying.
It's aggressive and it's very advanced.
I wish there was better news.
What do we do?
Well, I'm going to recommend a radiation oncologist
For therapy to help mend the rib.
It won't heal without it. Then a medical oncologist.
She could have nine months to a year,
But these treatments are usually palliative.
I'm so sorry.
Cking )
Oh, sorry about that.
You should put the sign out.
You're the maid?
And the messenger.
I guess they didn't know you were in here.
Wyatt called. It's a bushing on the rocker arm,
But it's got to come from tulsa.
So I'm gonna need another book.
The chlorine's k*ll the piss in the pool by now.
You can go for a swim.
Anything else to do around here?
( sighs )
There's football at the high school Friday night.
Revival church every night.
Fairview's got a drive-in,
But you don't have a car.
Where can I get a drink?
That's a little complicated.
But I probably can rustle up a bottle.
That'd be great.
Andy.
You want me to clean up?
Don. Maybe tomorrow.
- Man: There she is. - ( kids laughing )
Man: Don't run.
I'm in grand central. Come down.
Only to throw you under a train.
Come on.
I only have one question.
I better have gotten that lousy job.
You did, and it's not lousy.
I haven't even negotiated, we're already at 100 a year.
All benefits and unlimited private jet travel.
It's a flying limousine, pete.
You can have lunch in new york and be back for dinner.
Good, because I live here. I have to go.
- He wants to have dinner with wives. - No.
He's only meeting with you and one other guy.
Two last-round dinners.
Help me turn it into a horse race.
How many times do you think you can lie to this man?
We both told him you didn't want the job. What's the lie?
Well, for one thing, I don't have a wife.
For the other, I have four years left
On my contract with mccann
And a million dollars contingent on my presence.
Uh-huh, so now we know there's a price.
( chuckles ) you're talking to yourself.
Have dinner. Yuck it up.
Don't you want to sign him one day?
You know the corporate royalty on those planes?
7:30 Saturday.
Grill room at the four seasons.
Your wife's under the weather, but you didn't want to miss it.
There's two guys. Hy epstein wants to start treatment immediately
And he's conducting a study at new york hospital.
The other one--
Can't read my own writing.
He's a surgeon. Very aggressive.
But he's in bethesda.
Stop brushing your hair. How's the rib gonna heal?
My rib's not going to heal, henry.
You can't waste any more time being in shock.
- You have to do something. - Do what?
What do you think would happen if nelson rockefeller got this?
He would die!
Betty, do you want the kids to hear you talk that way?
I don't want them to hear anything until I've decided what to tell them.
That's what's on my mind, henry.
Do you want to help with that, or do you want to keep chasing your tail?
You're being morose.
You're a very lucky woman. You have been your whole life.
Stop yelling at me.
( knocking on door )
Thanks for the books.
It's $10.
I gave you $10.
It was hard to get.
( scoffs )
I'm not paying $20 for a bottle of whiskey
And a couple of paperbacks somebody left behind.
You've got the money.
I walked into town. And it's hard for me.
I got flatfeet.
- You want one? - No, sir.
I'm one-eighth comanche. Can't ever touch it.
Folks know the hustle you're running out of their motel?
My folks are over in woodward.
And ain't none of their business how I get rich.
That's true.
How'd you get rich?
I was in the advertising business.
You make commercials on tv?
Lots of them.
So many you don't have to work no more?
Anymore.
All right. Well, I'm around.
Don't forget to take the pie tammy made you.
( tv playing )
Sorry to bother you, but my tv just died.
Oh, well, we'll get you a new one.
Soon as I'm done fighting this battle.
"harbor lights" playing
There you go.
Then it comes loose.
( dings )
- You're the quick brown fox. - ( chuckles )
Did you learn to type in the army?
No, night school.
Were you in the service?
Yes.
Well, everybody who's a vet and likes drinking
Will be at the legion on Saturday night.
My husband would be tickled if you joined him.
Why didn't he ask me?
Oh, he's gonna. Soon as he spies a chance.
He could sure use someone new to tell his stories to.
I don't know that I'll be here,
Unless you know something about my car that I don't.
Wyatt's gonna overcharge you, but he'll get the work done.
Let's get that tv
So you can get back to relaxing.
( distant train horn blaring )
Hello?
The whole pie is for you.
Eat with me.
There were two pies.
I'm not gonna tell you what happened to the other one.
I have a favor to ask of you.
I can repay you.
I'll take her for a weekend next month. You can go away.
What?
I have a dinner with a potential client
And I'd love for you to join me.
No.
Thankfully, that's no longer one of my obligations.
You used to love it.
I daresay it got you excited trying to close over coffee.
I never closed anything.
I was just trying to stay awake.
Trudy, you understand my business.
No one else ever really has.
Well, I'm not comfortable being your date under any circumstances.
Well, then,
How about for old times' sake?
You know, I'm jealous of your ability
To be sentimental about the past.
I'm not able to do that.
I remember things as they were.
It's late.
I'd like to turn off the lights.
Well, good night, then.
Good night.
Because she got kicked out of brearley.
- ( screams ) - hold on. Easy.
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be in here.
Could you leave us alone, sweetheart?
Oh, of course.
Come have a seat.
I have some serious news.
It's bad news.
Your mother is sick.
She has lung cancer and it's very advanced.
I'm very sorry.
I've got to call her.
She doesn't want you kids to know.
Then why are you telling me?
Because there's hope she could have more time.
People do. It's a tough road, but it's a chance.
Well, that's good.
But she won't do it.
I don't know if she's just being stubborn or vain,
But she won't even hear of it.
Henry, my ears are still buzzing.
I don't understand you.
I breached her confidence because I want you
To talk some sense into her.
She'll listen to you.
I wouldn't know what to say.
It's okay for you to cry, honey.
( crying )
Jesus, what am I going to do?
How's she running?
Good as new.
I suppose you're gonna be on your way, then.
I should settle up.
Sure I can't talk you into joining us tonight?
I should get going.
Mister, I know you're not in a rush.
We got plenty of tourists with cars in the shop.
You made two phone calls in six days.
Wyatt thought you ran away.
I don't know.
Tell you what.
I'll throw in the room tonight
And I'll give you another night if you fix the coke machine.
I don't think I can help you with that.
I know you were right about your car.
And sharon said she caught you being handy.
Don't they fix it?
They want to give me a new one,
But I like this one. I'll get my tools.
Henry: Hello?
Smells good.
I brought you a surprise.
Betty.
What are you doing here?
I got in trouble at school again.
What'd you do?
I don't want to talk about it.
Are we supposed to eat?
Genie, come over here.
"I like to dance the swedish waltz" playing
So, I'm going to tell you in advance
That I know we seem like fine people,
But I've been a little dishonest.
Okay.
This is a fundraiser
For al bettendorf over there.
His house b*rned down. Well, the kitchen.
The most expensive room.
There's a fine jar.
We're just strangers, but it does include barbecue
And I'm getting your drinks.
$40 for don!
( cheering )
What's your rank and where did you serve?
7th infantry. Korea.
Rank?
Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, 7th infantry, korea.
Man: Shit, we should be paying him.
( men laugh )
That's $5 for swearing.
What are you drinking?
( sighs )
I'll just have the shrimp cocktail.
Well, as mother used to say, "you're not that fat."
( laughs )
No, I have a-- well, something came up.
Since I invited you?
You're always complaining we never see each other.
Then I ask you to dinner, miss a very important meeting,
And you have other plans?
It was very short notice.
If you need an alibi, you're going to have to ask.
Please.
Now, what did you want to talk about?
Let me ask you something.
How do you know when something's really an opportunity?
I'm wrong sometimes,
But the girls aren't shy nowadays.
( chuckles ) no, I meant in your career.
Oh. Well, in banking there's a road and you just stay on it.
Still, you're required to assess risk.
Pete, I don't buy or sell anything.
I just distribute and it's never up to me.
Fine, forget your business.
You're taking a risk tonight.
So now you're jealous and you're trying to ruin my evening.
Your wife knows.
I'm not asking you to imagine it,
I'm telling you she knows.
And how do you feel now that you know that?
Judy's always loved that I was attractive to other women.
It's part of what she likes about me.
I'm just supposed to turn that off?
You're not supposed to act on it.
But I always have. That's the way we are.
But why? Always looking for something better.
Always looking for something else.
Because dad was like that.
He really was, wasn't he?
You know, once at the polo grounds,
Some jeweler thanked him profusely for buying a diamond necklace.
Dad got very cross and called off the sale right in front of me.
He kept muttering how the man was indiscreet.
I looked it up.
I didn't need any detective work.
I just saw the way women looked at him.
You really think she knows?
I think it feels good and then it doesn't.
( sighs ) I have to make a phone call.
Don't listen to me.
I'll be right back.
And wayne's dad ran the drugstore before wayne.
He was all 10 commandments rolled into one.
( laughs )
He caught us smoking, stealing, cussing.
My wife went to high school with these two.
They were hooligans.
I didn't break the real commandments till I was in europe.
Were you in europe, don?
Don was in korea.
You don't just need new glasses, you need a new hearing aid.
Well, he hasn't said anything.
Did you introduce him to--
Hey, jerry! Jerry fandango!
Get over here.
Jerry served in korea.
So, you know, maybe you've seen him before.
What the ( inaudible ) do you farts want?
- Gerald fanning, this is-- - don was in korea.
You two can reminisce.
I don't want to talk about it.
Jerry fanning. Pfc, 34th infantry.
Come on, let me see your face.
When and where?
It was before they called it a w*r. Near the yalu river.
Oh, hell.
I wasn't there till christmas '53.
I was home by then.
Have a seat.


No, I got one.
Tell you one thing about korea.
They can keep it.
( drums b*at )
( drumroll )
( cheering )
( whistling )
( cheering )
( drums playing )
( tv playing )
( banging on door )
( banging )
Go away.
Duck: What the hell happened to you?
You stood me up.
Get in here.
I never said I would go.
You did, and mike was waiting with charlene at the grill room
For an hour!
For heaven's sake, you're drunk.
And you're being very menacing right now.
I'm happy. Listen to me.
You're on a streak.
You're on one of those magic--
We used to call it a trend.
You know, because of the graph where the line just goes up.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mike called me from his hotel room.
He was pretty sore.
So I told him that you wanted to come,
But you were insulted by the offer.
- You what? - He wants to do it all.
Company car, company plane, signing bonus.
And he's gonna get you out of mccann.
He's gonna give me a million dollars?
He's gonna get very close with stock options
And mccann's gonna cut a deal for the rest
Because you're gonna help them.
Learjet's a tiny account. It's peanuts to them.
You're not the client. Your passengers are.
Jim hobart's very excited about who flies on those planes.
Every important ceo in america.
You talked to jim hobart?
You know what $100 buys you in wichita?
A two-bedroom house.
You stupid wino.
You're going to destroy everything!
Who's going to win the world series this year?
I don't know.
You are! ( laughs )
Because you are charmed, my friend.
Good night, duck.
I've been there. It doesn't last long.
So the doctor says, "sorry, son,
But your pecker's got gangrene.
We're gonna have to amputate."
( laughs )
So the gi goes to the jap doctor.
"oh, good news. No need to amputate.
In three days will fall off by itself."
( laughing )
To don!
For being generous and not saying shit.
I don't know that many jokes.
Oh, just leave him alone.
Don, you're not allowed to say,
"I don't want to talk about it" in this place.
That's why I never joined.
You're not listening to me.
You're among friends.
Floyd, tell him.
- Floyd! - What?
Tell him about the hurtgen forest.
Give me a drink.
Tell him the story first.
( sighs ) oh, shit.
You know where it is?
It's on the border between belgium and germany.
( sighs )
We were cut off.
Three of us.
Actually...
There were nine of us originally.
( sighs )
We came on a machine g*n nest.
There were four krauts in there looking to surrender.
They had their hands in the air with their papers.
They were starving. Don't skip that.
We were starving.
Scrounging for grub.
We were boiling bark.
So there's three of us,
Four of them,
And more snow coming.
You did what you had to do.
What did you do?
Someone made them start digging.
And we bounced them.
One at a time.
Took a couple of hours.
One of them was so skinny, he tried to run away,
His pants fell down.
You know they all got blue eyes.
You just do what you have to do to come home.
I k*ll my co.
We were under fire.
Fuel was everywhere.
And I dropped my lighter.
And I blew him apart.
And I got to go home.
That is the name of the game.
Hey, where is that kid?
We need a bottle over here!
Over here!
- Over here! - ( men laughing )
¶ get that kid with the booze over here... ¶
( chuckles )
¶ 'cause the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere ¶
¶ over there, over there ¶
¶ send the word, send the word over there ¶
¶ 'cause the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the yanks are coming ¶
¶ the drums rum-tumming everywhere... ¶
( door opens )
- Did I wake you? - No.
Henry shouldn't have scared you.
I wanted to tell you myself.
He doesn't know you won't get treatment
Because you love the tragedy.
( sighs ) sally, I've learned
To believe people when they tell you it's over.
They don't want to say it, so it's usually the truth.
Henry said you could have a year.
And what would that year be like?
I'll be with you.
I won't let you give up.
I know that.
But I watched my mother die.
I won't do that to you.
And I don't want you to think I'm a quitter.
I fought for plenty in my life.
That's how I know when it's over.
It's not a weakness.
It's been a gift to me.
To know when to move on.
These are instructions.
Open it the minute you know I'm gone.
- No. - Listen to me.
Things happen very quickly when people die.
Henry's not going to be able to handle things.
You're going back to school in the morning.
I don't want you alarming your brothers.
Go back to sleep.
- ( footsteps ) - ( voices whispering )
( keys rattling )
What the hell?
We want our money.
What?
We know you took the money.
Let me go! Sharon, what's going on?
Your car was fixed. You should have been on your way.
Now, I don't know who the hell you are,
But you've got five mississippi to get our money back.
I didn't take your money.
You threw all that money around
'cause you knew you'd get it back.
( grunts )
I mean business!
You really think I need your spare change?
Give us the cash and you can have your car back.
- Probably stolen. - We'll find out.
( door closes )
( knocking )
My god, what's wrong?
I need to speak with you.
My goodness, it's 4:00 in the morning.
Is everything all right?
You're scaring me. Please, what is it?
It's good news. Catch your breath.
( exhales ) what on earth is going on?
I was offered a job tonight.
Because its origins were supernatural,
I realized that its benefits might be as well.
I want you and tammy to come with me.
I want you to relocate to wichita, pick out a house,
And be my wife and family again.
Peter, I'm not dismissing you...
I'm saying with respect to whatever
Is happening in your eyes right now,
We both know things can't be undone.
Says who?
We're not even through half our lives.
And even if we are, we're entitled to more.
Of what?
Then we're entitled to something new.
I want to start over.
And I know I can.
I'm not so dumb anymore.
I'm not ignoring the fact that I could actually lose your love.
You never lost it.
But I will never allow you to hurt me again.
I love you, too.
I always have.
I've never loved anyone else.
Never.
( sighs )
You think you can come in here
When I'm all disoriented
And say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago
And make me run away with you?
I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.
I do.
Wichita is beautiful.
And wholesome.
And not the city and not cos cob.
And you'll have a plane to use at your disposal.
We will.
To pick up and go anywhere anytime we want.
Like driving to montauk.
I want to go everywhere with you.
Say yes with your voice, not just your eyes.
Oh!
( breathing heavily )
How will I explain this to tammy?
Tell her her birthday wish came true.
I'm gonna go.
And we're gonna have dinner on Saturday night.
The three of us.
Like it was the first time.
Good morning.
( knocking )
This one's on the house.
What do you want to know? You want to know what I told them?
I'm just being a good citizen, man.
You don't know anything about me. I could k*ll you right now.
You took that money and you set me up.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You have shitty instincts for a con man.
You're lucky you feel guilty.
That's the one difference between you and those animals right now.
I don't feel guilty taking that drunk's money.
He b*rned his own house down.
He doesn't deserve a pot to piss in, let alone 500 bucks.
You're gonna get me that money,
Pack your bag, and get out of town.
I can't leave without that money.
I know you think you know how to hustle,
But this is a big crime, stealing these people's money.
If you keep it, you'll have to become somebody else.
And it's not what you think it is.
You cannot get off on that foot in this life.
What do you care?
You got money. I know you got money.
I cleaned your room and didn't take nothing.
Anything.
You think this town is bad now?
Wait until you can never come back.
Can I go?
Go get the money.
I'm not paying for the room.
Could you drop me off at the bus stop?
( sighs )
Get in.
I'm off.
- Where are you going? - I have class.
Why are you doing that?
Why was I ever doing it?
( sighs )
Betty's voice: "dear sally,
I know that you're frightened
And there are many decisions I can't prepare you for,
But you must immediately tell the hospital
And the funeral director that I'm to be interred intact
In the family plot in west laurel.
Uncle william has the details from grandpa gene's burial.
I've also enclosed a portrait
From the 1968 republican winter gala.
The blue chiffon I wore is my very favorite.
I hung it in a gold garment bag in the hall closet beside the mink.
Please bring them the lipstick from my handbag
And remind them how I like to wear my hair.
Will you show them the picture?
Sally, I always worried about you
Because you March to the b*at of your own drum.
But now I know that's good.
I know your life will be an adventure."
( girls laughing )
Betty's voice: "I love you. Mom."
( crying )
( turns off engine )
Pink slip's in the glove box.
What?
Don't waste this.
( starts engine )
