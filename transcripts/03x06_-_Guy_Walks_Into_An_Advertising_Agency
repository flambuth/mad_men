Daddy, dont.
Its 10:30. Why arent you asleep?
- Im afraid.- Sally.
I know. Youre not Thomas Edison.
What are you afraid of?
Im afraid of whats going to happenwhen you turn off the lights.
Im home now.
Nothing can hurt you.
Except maybe this mess.
Pick up your room,well get you a nightlight.
Okay.
Go to sleep.
- What did you find out?- Nothing.
I bet theyre gonna make us workover the holiday.
- And Cosgroves late.- Can we have everyones attention, please?
This will only take a moment,and it will not be repeated.
Thats not true, Mr. Hooker.
Weve just been informedthat there will be a visit
from the director and chairman of the boardof Putnam, Powell & Lowe,
the purpose of which is both friendly
and, of course,to evaluate our performance.
- Mr. Hooker.- The visit will commence tomorrow,
that is Tuesday, at 10:00and will continue into the next day.
We apologize. We realize we wereto be closed Wednesday, July 3rd, but...
Come on.
They were unaware of the holiday.
Now we merely needthat everyone continue to operate
at the height of their productivityand to make sure
that their desks and officesare shipshape and Bristol fashion.
And by no meansshould these preparations
interfere with our work today.Very good, then.
Don, may we have a word?
Well, isnt this perfect?
Well, well just move it from lunchto the end of the day.
Im having a cake delivered.Hows that going to look?
A cake for what?
Tomorrow is Joans last day. I told you that.
But if were working on Wednesday,wouldnt that be her last day?
I dont know why shed come in.
Greg finds out about his residencytoday or tomorrow. Im not sure.
I think theyre going away to celebrate.
on the state of television,and, of course, account updates.
- Just a few minutes each.- On each account?
No, a few minutes for each of you.
And Mr. Kinsey,you might want to shave your beard.
What? Who the hell are you people?
That was a joke.
Theres no need for panic.
Just think of this as the sameas any major client visit.
Theyre flying across the oceanto have their knobs polished?
Fourth of July. Subtle.
- Get the door, will you?- The British are coming.
I assume you know what this is about.
I have a theory.I believe theyre coming to see you.
Why?
Theyve shown a great dealof interest in you.
Ever since you swung around your privatesin the boardroom with Duck last year.
They study and dissect your work,trying to decipher
what is your particular American genius.
- What do you think it is? The presidency?- No, I think itll be a creative umbrella
with a dual positionin London and New York.
- London?- Bye-bye, Don.
How congenial you two are.
I hope you can maintain this pretensewhen they arrive.
Excuse me?
Kiss and make upbefore you cost us all something.
- Youre being melodramatic.- Miss Blankenship,
please make an appointment at Angelosfor Misters Sterling and Draper,
the soonest available.
- I have my own barber.- Thats not necessary.
Enough. Everyone wants Martin and Lewis.
Reconcile.
Damn it!
Its done! John Deere is done.The 110 lawn and garden tractor
with snow thrower and transparentvinyl enclosure, and a key.
Look at him. He just brought in a mastodon.
Sorry Im late.
Big accounts move slowly,but the John Deere doesnt.
Listen, Mr. Clampett. You might want to getyour iron horse out of reception.
I will, after everybody sees it.
- No, P.P.L. is coming.- When?
- Tomorrow morning.- And we have to work Wednesday.
- We have to give presentations.- You got that one just in time.
Yeah, I guess I did.
Shes in here!
Im resting,and your little brothers sleeping.
All he does is sleep.
- What are you doing?- Im bored.
- Go bang your head against a wall.- Mom.
Only boring people are bored.
- Can I pet him?- Dont wake him.
Come over here.
Go play.
You can sleep all you want,little pig in a blanket.
That is quite a shave.
Im thinking about my toes right now.
- Go to town.- Hes next.
- I already had one.- See, thats not true.
You thinktheres something feminine about it?
My father was the tallest, handsomest,vainest man in New York,
and he got his nails done.
He had his fourth coronarybehind the wheel and hit a tree.
The windshield severed his arm,
and he was dead,so they never put it back on.
In the casket he had one hand.The nails were perfect.
- I dont believe that story.- Okay, so he hit another car and not a tree.
Its my company. Why should I be nervous?
Because you sold it.
So thats it? Thats what I did to you?I got you a half-million dollars?
- Im really sorry about that.- No one said you did anything.
You sound like Burl Ives.
Part of the problem with Mona
is that one dayshe just started judging people.
Never gave a crap before.
Ill tell you right now, Don.I dont like being judged.
Listen, Roger... Im okay, Angelo.
We dont need to talk about this anymore.I promise.
I was holding out for gratitude,but Ill take that.
Thank you.
Well, maybe now youll have the moneyand the glory.
Call the photographers,type service and vendors
and tell them all deliveries should comebetween 9:30 and 11:00
so the British can see lots of activitywhen they arrive.
Now.
Are you being short with mebecause you think itll make parting easier?
My mother used to do that.
Im noticing for the first timethat the ladies out here are rather plain,
- present company excluded.- Well, we could hire some prostitutes.
I know your prime ministerenjoys their company.
The secretary of w*r,
and youd do bestnot to bring that up tomorrow.
- I apologize.- Well, I apologize that tomorrows visit
will steal from your spotlight.
Perhaps we can rescheduleyour surprise party till after the holiday?
Why did you do that?
Do what? Mrs. Harris knows everything.Im sure she was expecting it.
Im going to go home and makea celebratory dinner for my husband.
And when you wake upin the middle of the night
and wonder what you forgot, dont call me.
- Well, thats smooth.- I got a shave.
- Why?- They ordered me to do it.
We have an inspection tomorrow.The British.
Well, you look very successful.
Hot or cold?Swedish meatballs or chicken salad?
Chicken salad.
Did you pick up a nightlight?
I did, and I read her to sleep.She was still clingy.
I dont remember her being that resentfulof Bobby when he was born.
- I dont know that she resents him.- Well, she wont go near him.
She wont even go in his roomunless I make her.
- Why are they visiting?- We dont know.
Delayed everybodys vacation plans.
He was perfect today.
- Who?- Gene.
Would you ever want to live in London?
Im serious.
Of course.I could get a pram and a real nanny.
- What do you know?- Nothing.
Where the hell were you?
I told you I was going for drinkswith the docs.
You didnt tell me anything.You didnt call me.
- I called you at work.- Thats a lie. I just ate dinner for two.
Get over here.
I know youre drunk. Come sit next to me.
So what happened?
I...
I didnt get it.
What happened?
It doesnt say anything
except that they made Doug Hutchinsonchief resident.
And I felt the floor open up under me.
So youll get it next year.You knew it was possible.
I ran into Eddingerabout a half-hour before the letter came,
and I could tell something was wrong.He wouldnt look me in the eye.
I figured he felt bad
and Id at least find outwhat the hell happened.
- But he didnt feel bad.- What are you talking about? He loves you.
He sat me down in his officeand he poured a drink and he said...
He said I had no brains in my fingers.
But he wrote youall those nice evaluations...
Damn it, Joan! Doctors dont writebad things about each other.
- So youll go to another hospital.- Not in New York.
If I want to stay in surgery,I can go to Alabama or something.
So what happens?Youre still a doctor, right?
I am.
Im just not a surgeon,and I will never be a surgeon.
- Did they fire you?- I dont want to talk about it, Joanie, okay?
I was hoping you were asleep.
I have another year of residency.Youre not gonna be able to leave your job.
- Greg, thats done.- Well, get another one.
Honey.
Listen.
You are still a doctor.
I married you for your heart,not your hands.
They all went out to celebrate.
I couldnt do it. I just couldnt do it.I couldnt fake it.
Ive been sitting in the Dublin Housesince 2:00.
Go lay down. Ill undress you.Just let me close the light.
Mr. Hooker, you neglected to tell methat our guests have arrived.
To what do I owe the pleasure?
This is Mrs. Harris.She was the office manager before me,
but she is off to greener pastures.
- Well, thats a shame. Guy MacKendrick.- Joan Harris.
This is Mr. Harold Ford.And you recall Saint John Powell.
- Weve spoken on the phone.- I believe thats true.
I just wanted to tell you,I made a reservation at La Grenouille at 6:00
and got you two tickets to Oliver!Its a wonderful show.
Ive heard that.A tragedy with a happy ending.
My favorite kind.
Thank you, Joan.Shall I give you the threepenny tour?
Please let everyone know that theyre here.
We have you scheduled to meetwith Sterling, Cooper and Draper,
and then with Mr. Pryce, of course,
and then a light lunchin the conference room
with the personnel you requested.
Tomorrow, the presentationsand client meetings.
- Saint John, good to see you again.- Peter Campbell. This is Guy MacKendrick.
I know everything about you.Youre a very impressive fellow.
- I wish I could return the compliment.- Well, perhaps one day you shall.
Good morning, gentlemen.
- Hello.- Miss Olson, one of our copywriters.
I know everything about you.You are a very impressive young woman.
Why, thank you. I was just writing copy.
- As you were.- I hope we chat later.
Mr. Draper is waiting for youin Mr. Coopers office.
This way.
That is a very handsome man.
- Good to see all of you.- Its a pleasure.
Don, no worse for wear, I see.
What a delightful custom.From the Far East, I assume?
- Japan.- How was your trip?
Gentlemen, Id like you to meet Harold Ford,and this young man is Guy MacKendrick.
Mr. Cooper.
- Mr. Sterling, what an honor.- Call me Roger.
- And you must be Don Draper.- I am.
I cant tell you how exciting it isto finally meet you.
Thats very flattering.
Guy here has done a study of your work,which is quite a compliment.
You see,in addition to his inestimable charm,
Guy here has degreesfrom Cambridge University
and the London School of Economics.
Three years at the Bank,two years at McCann,
and his most recent coup, Mercedes-Benz.
- Thats very impressive.- I apologize.
I didnt realize he was going to recitemy entire curriculum vitae.
- You left out modest.- Well, were going to debrief Mr. Pryce,
and the plan is for youto join us for luncheon.
- In the conference room at 1:00.- Sounds like Agatha Christie.
Well, apparently our tour continues.
I look forward to... How do you say?Catching up?
I as well.
Well, that was strange.
Look at that. The suspense is k*ll him.
Yes?
Mr. Powell and Mr. Ford are here to see you.
- Spectacles.- Right.
Send them in.
- Gentlemen.- Greetings, Saint John.
Harold, what a pleasure.
Please see to itthat Guy has a space to prepare.
- Right away.- Gentlemen. Theres coffee and cake.
Were very impressed, Lane.Very, very impressed indeed.
In nine months,youve trimmed every bit of excess,
increased billings,and we havent heard a word of complaint.
Yes, well, Pax Romana and all that.
Bravo. Weve decidedto offer you something
that we hope youll viewas a reward and a challenge.
- Is it in the box?- In a manner of speaking.
Open it.
What is that? It looks like a snake.
Fancy that.
- Is it real?- It was.
Its for our snake charmer.Were sending you to b*mb.
b*mb? What would I do there?
Well, hopefully the same thingyou accomplished here.
Where shall I put this?
I guess I neednt find a spot for itif Im simply moving again.
Dont pout.
One of your greatest qualitiesis you always do as youre told.
No, its just the logistics.
My wife just settled,my son just accepted to school,
- and now were moving on?- Nonsense. Youre moving up.
Thats the spirit.
So, without further ado,I will give the floor to Guy MacKendrick.
Let me begin by offeringmy warmest wishes and admiration
for Lane Pryce and his exemplary work.Itll be hard to lose him,
but theres no doubtthat our loss is Indias gain.
Now, let me saytheres no cause for anxiety.
There will be no further reductionsin the ranks.
Yes, thats good news.
If I might, Id like to walk you throughthis slight reorganization.
As before,P.P.L. London will be the head of this body,
and Sterling Cooper, now more than ever,our American presence.
Our business maturitywith your creative edge.
A triumvirate of Don and myselfand Mr. Cooper, our chairman emeritus,
will oversee three streamlined departments.Creative, art and copy.
Account management, thats Mr. Cosgrove,Mr. Campbell for the present,
and a combined television/mediadepartment headed by Mr. Crane.
Mr. Sterlings not on that chart at all.
- Thats true.- Well, that was an oversight.
As you can see,nothing much has really changed.
Frankly, my presence hereis just to ensure thorough communication,
that we help each otheron both sides of the pond.
Whether it be a sharing of creative genius,
media savvy,
or the unbridled acquisitionof new business.
Im sure you all have a thousand questions.
But for the time being,I say we inform the troops,
so that the transitioncan begin immediately after the holiday.
- Shall I have Mr. Hooker prepare a memo?- No. Nonsense.
I dont want this to be the kind of placewhere such news is delivered that way.
Shall we?
Gosh, were really going to miss you.
- What the hell just happened?- They reorganized us,
and youre the only one in this roomwho got a promotion.
- Really?- Yes, really.
I apologize for my wild imagination.
See? Its clean.
Thats not what I want to talk to you about.
Whats this?
Its for you.
"For my new big sister,the best in the world."
And my goodness, its from baby Gene.
Look.
Baby Gene cant write.
Babies get fairies to do things.You know that.
Its really from him. Im not kidding.I think you should open it.
- What is it?- Its a Barbie.
I think he wants you to knowthat he wants to be your friend.
And you are very important to me, too.
Im sure you all have a thousand questions,
but before I raise a glassto Sterling Coopers future,
I should like to recognize its past.
Most recently,the inspired stewardship of Lane Pryce.
Hear! Hear!
Im also awareof a rather significant milestone.


Mrs. Harris,from those whove known you only hours
to those who have cherishedyour nearly 10 years of service,
I wish you caviar and childrenand all that is good in your new life.
There, there. That wasnt my intention.
Mrs. Harris, please.
Well have our presentations tomorrow.Let this afternoon be a fete worthy of Joan.
Enjoy the liquor and delicatessen.
Thank you. Thank you all.
- This is completely unnecessary.- Youll be sorely missed.
We got you the cake.
Well...
So, what now?They keep adding people above us.
One more promotionand were gonna be answering phones.
We should go say hi.
- This is good champagne.- I dont think so.
Im going to get something to eat.
Mr. Draper,Conrad Hiltons office is on the line.
- What?- Conrad Hilton, the hotel owner.
Yeah, I know what he does.Why is he calling?
I dont know.
- And hes calling for me?- Yes. Well, his office is.
Put him through.
- Donald Draper.- Mr. Draper, this is Miss Wakeman.
Mr. Hilton has expressed a desireto meet with you.
May I ask what this is regarding?
I just set his schedule.When are you available?
- How about right now?- Right now? Please hold.
- How far are you from the Waldorf Astoria?- Fifteen minutes.
Its the presidential suite.
Im on my way.
- Wheres Miss Blankenship?- Shes down there saluting Union Jack.
- What is that?- Chocolate pudding.
I wasnt even on the chart.My names on the wall out there.
- You want some?- No.
I like to think, "Im rich. They cant hurt me."
Thats a mistake.
Im being punishedfor making my job look easy.
Although that kid, Guy, he has a spark.He is a pure account man.
And what is that job all about?
I dont know. Its about listening to people
and never sayingwhats really on your mind.
No. Its about letting things goso you can get what you want.
Have a nice holiday. Enjoy the fireworks.
We took their money.We have to do what they say.
My dad keeps talking about Vietnam.I think he wants me to get drafted.
First of all, theyre hardly drafting anybody.Second of all, youre too old.
Third of all, I have a friend in the army,and if youre smart, youre set.
He sits behind a desk at Fort Dixand screws secretaries all day.
- Does he sh**t the peoples?- I dont know. I gotta take a piss.
- Joan.- Yes?
- May I speak with you?- Thank you.
I just...I wanted to get you a card or a present.
Itd be nice if I gave you a gift for once
and you didnt wonderif I wanted something.
Knock yourself out.
I dont want you to thinkI never listen to you.
Its just we cant all be you.
Be that as it may,I do take some credit for your success here.
- Hey, put that back.- Im going home!
I cant believe Im gonna miss this!
Im really happythat you got what you wanted.
I remember on my first dayyou said that could happen to me
- if I played my cards right.- Are you getting sentimental?
Oh, my God.
Dont worry.Im sure well see each other all the time.
If we dont, I just have to say...
- For the love of Christ!- Oh, my God.
My foot!
- Call an ambulance!- Holy crap!
Jesus!
Theres a tourniquet in the first aid kit.Youre gonna be okay.
Good God.
I cant feel a thing.
- God! What did I do?- Get her out of here!
The ambulance is on its way.
- Im Donald Draper.- Weve met before.
- We have, havent we?- Yellow Rock Country Club.
- We had a drink. Of course.- You fixed it for me. Let me return the favor.
I cant believe youre Conrad Hilton.
- Connie.- Don.
Food? Best kitchen in the world.Got a salad named after it.
Im fine. I really should have known that.
I dont know. Now...
After this comes out next week...
Well, they dont do that for everyone.
I think I look like an Arab.
How did you find me?
I called around,told people I had a long chat
with a handsome fellowfrom Sterling Cooper,
and your name never came up.
Apparently you dont have long chatswith people.
Well, here I am. What can I do for you?
What do you think?
I think you wouldnt bein the presidential suite right now
- if you worked for free.- Don, this is friendly.
Connie, this is my profession.What do you want me to do?
I want you to give me one for free.
I dont think anybody wants to thinkabout a mouse in a hotel.
Well, that was my idea.You got something better?
I might.
So, what do you want?
Im not gonna lie.Id love a chance at your business.
Okay.
But the next time somebody like measks you a question like that,
you need to think bigger.
Well, Connie,
there are snakesthat go months without eating,
and then they finally catch something,
but theyre so hungrythat they suffocate while theyre eating.
One opportunity at a time.
Sorry to interrupt.Mr. Draper, you have an emergency call.
Home or office?
Do you understand whats happened here?That were not to be trusted?
Shes an idiot.I didnt know she couldnt drive.
But you took the machine out.
You have to have respectfor that equipment.
- Its very safe when operated correctly.- We had the world handed to us on a plate,
and then you swing in on a chandelier,drop your pants and crap on it.
Jesus, its like Iwo Jima out there.
We should put a rubber mat downso Cooper can get around.
Theyre changing the carpeting.
- Any news?- He might lose his foot.
Right when he got it in the door.
- Oh, God.- Sit down, Sissy Mary. Youre pale.
I take full responsibility.
Believe me, somewhere in this business,this has happened before.
Joan. My God.
- I know. Its ruined.- How is he?
I didnt expect you to come over.I just thought you should know.
Honestly, when I called you,I thought he might die.
- But hes not going to?- No. Hes lost the foot.
Jesus, thats awful.
Lane went to retrieve Powell and Fordfrom dinner.
Theyve already talked to the doctor.
Ill wait.
Despite the circus today,
I hope you knowthat you are going to be terribly missed.
Thats nice to hear,especially from you, Don.
I bet he felt greatwhen he woke up this morning.
Im sure youre right.
But thats life.One minute, youre on top of the world,
the next minute, some secretaryis running you over with a lawn mower.
Don.
Im heartbroken.
- Its a terrible tragedy.- One that surely could have been avoided,
although, Mrs. Harris,thank you for your quick thinking.
- You may have saved his life.- Such as it is.
He was a great account man. A prodigy.He could talk a Scotsman out of a penny.
- Now thats all over.- I dont know if thats true.
The man is missing a foot.How is he going to work? He cant walk.
The doctor said hell never golf again.
Im afraid we have to reevaluateour entire strategy.
- Lane will remain here indefinitely.- Well close the office tomorrow, obviously.
Mrs. Harris, please allow the companyto reimburse you for that dress,
just as a token of our gratitude.
I think Saint John and Ishould see him if we can.
Of course.
You should get hometo that lucky husband.
Yes.
- Can I get you one?- Sure.
Ive been reading a lotof American literature lately.
- Tom Sawyer.- Thats a good one.
I feel like I just went to my own funeral.I didnt like the eulogy.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Daddy!- Hey. Hey, I got you. I got you. Just breathe.
Get him out, Daddy!Please, Daddy, save me.
I dont even know what to say.
Daddy.
Calm down and tell me whats going on.
Grandpa Gene.Hes not supposed to be here anymore.
Hes not.
Hes called Gene, he sleeps in his room,he looks just like him,
and I bet when he starts talking,hes gonna sound just like him, too.
Hes a baby. Thats it.
I want you to go to sleep.Theres no such thing as ghosts.
Betts, this has to stop.
Theres nothing I can do.Shes jealous of her little brother.
No, shes not jealous, shes scared,and its all because he has that name.
"That name."
Youve never liked itand you havent hidden it well,
- and now youre bringing her into this.- Thats ridiculous. Lets talk about Sally.
Shes a child. Shell get over it.Now you have to.
He was my father and that was his name.
Its what people do, Don.Its how they keep the memory alive.
He hated me and I hated him.Thats the memory.
Thats his name!
Im really sorry. I didnt mean to wake him.
Thats okay, honey. Everythings fine.
Come on. Lets get you to sleep.
Come over here.
You see? Its all right.
This is your little brother,
and hes only a baby.
We dont know who he is yet,
or who hes going to be.
And that is a wonderful thing.
