I know you said to call at night,but, uh, I havent been alone.
I understand. I have a moment.
So how is she?
Well, its only been a short periodin therapeutic time.
But shes making progress?
Shes not particularly forthcoming yet.
What has she been talking about?
Mostly, she seems consumedwith petty jealousies
and overwhelmedwith everyday activities.
Basically, were dealing withthe emotions of a child here.
She wasnt always like this.
Well, were finding that this kind of anxietyis not uncommon in housewives.
And lets not forget, the death of a parentis extremely destabilizing.
So thats it.
Well, thats the beginning, certainly.
As she becomes moreforthcoming, we may be able
to shed some light on the deeper issuesas she talks more.
- There are deeper issues?- Usually.
These are not groundbreakingrevelations, Mr. Draper.
Im concerned, obviously.
Of course. We both are.
Time and talk. Thats what Irecommend right now.
And again, evenings are better for me.
Well, I appreciate your time.
Mona, I am drinking my milk right now.
Go to Mims. Bring the heiress.
The Montclair air mightwipe the scowl off her face.
Knock, knock.
Call me from there.
Ill try to make it out by Sunday afternoon.
I just got off the phone with UFC,
and theyre having the Nixon boysstop by at the end of the week.
- With Nixon?- No, thank God.
Otherwise, Id have to move the pianoout of my office.
Hopefully, hell decide he needs us.
Well, the ones with the best productmake the worst clients.
Stop smoking so much.
Its a sign of weakness.
You know how h*tlergot Neville Chamberlain
to give him everything at Munich?
He held the conferenceat an old palace that forbid smoking.
And after an hour and a halfof not smoking,
Neville Chamberlain would have given h*tlerhis mother as a dance partner.
All I can get from this storyis that h*tler didnt smoke.
And I do.
Good night, peanut.
Last one to Chumleys getsto wheel Kenneth Cosgrove,
published author, home in a baby carriage.
- Hello there.- Good news.
Mona and Margaret are going out of townfor the weekend.
Monas mother fell down the steps.
- Youre really blessed.- Come on over.
Ill put on my whites.Well pretend its V.J. Day.
What goes in there, an aspirin?
I suppose I could have taken a suitcaseanywhere this weekend.
And I dont mean your apartment.
I got us a couple of sandwiches,and filled a thermos for the train.
Mr. Sterling, this is Carol, my roommate.
Nice to meet you, Carol.
Miss Holloway, I havean accounting question.
We will go away. Not tonight,but some weekend coming up.
Puerto Rico?
I dont care if its Cuba.I need a little notice.
Youve got a lot of rules, Red.
Be good, girls.
I dont mind you stayinglate, just as long as youre not trying
- to milk us for the dinner money.- Its work.
Just because tomorrows Fridaydoesnt mean I expect
to be pulling your headoff the keys in the morning.
What are you doing tonight?
Uh, working and going home.
Ill let you enjoy that one, honey,but I was talking to Donald here.
- Im on the 5:31.- Reservations at home.
Ive had those. Easiest ones to break.
Besides, they love it whenyou keep them guessing. It adds spice.
Trying to get me in trouble?Bettys cooking.
One drink. You owe me that.
- Did I miss something?- No.
Don and I talk all the timewhen youre not around.
In fact, were gonna do it right now.
Don? Shall we?
- Well, good night, boys.- Good night, Paul.
I love doing that.
You seem like a busy little girl.
Draper pushing you around enough?
What does that mean?
Burning the midnight oilis not good for your skin.
Oh, no, its...
Its for something else.Im working on copy.
On your own?
Mr. Rumsen liked what I didin the brainstorming thingy.
Sanitary napkins?
- No. Lipstick.- What did I say?
Its the Belle Jolie account.
Mr. Campbell, your wifecalled from the Four Seasons.
- Theyve been seated.- Thank you, Hildy.
Want me to take a look at it?I do it for a lot of the fellows.
Really?
Yeah. Really.
That would be super.
Well, were all in it together.
Two!
So they fired all the guys in the middleand moved up their mail room staff,
right before all the salaries got expensive.
Smart.
Is that what were gonna do?
Were not going to do anything.
At a certain age, they lose that.
What?
That glow of pure youth.
Its like they hit 30,and somebody puts out a light.
I dont think those twohave 30 years between them.
Polka dots looks like a lot of fun.
Yeah, youll have to let me know.
Jesus, you must be starving.
I know I am. Whats Betty making?
I dont know.
Mona hasnt cooked sinceMargaret stopped eating.
Theyre fighting it out.Im the one that gets hurt.
Ill call Betty. Tell her well be three.
No!
- You sure?- Are you kidding?
Shell be thrilled.
Whens the last time she saw you?
Well take my car.Save you train fare.
- My eyes are burning.- Thats impossible.
That better not be Daddysaying hes going to be late.
Dont do gymnastics in the house.
Draper residence.
You are coming home, right?
Yes. Im coming home.
Unfortunately, Roger has decidedhe needs a home-cooked meal.
Youre kidding.
I dont know if I have enough food.
Birdie, what do you put inthat freezer I bought you?
Frozen food.
What do you want me to say?
Betty, this steak...
You sure you dont want some?
No, thank you, Roger.
Im a vegetarian sometimes.
Mona has a little calorie bookshe keeps on the refrigerator.
Always has her nose in there.
Maybe she wantsto look good for you.
Isnt that a nice thought?
I was pudgy as a girl, if you can believe it.
I came into Home Ec in the 8th grade
with a pattern for big girl pajamas.
The teacher asked who I wasmaking the pajamas for.
I didnt realize how muchweight Id lost that summer.
Swim camp, I guess.
I went from Tadpole to Polliwog that year.
Sounds like a lateral move.
When I was little, in the summerwe used to swim at night.
In a pool, not the ocean.
Warm air,
light dancing in the blue...
Night swimming. Its divine.
Sometimes naked.
Believe me, on those nights,it was very difficult to go to sleep.
You ever experienced that, Don?
Trouble sleeping? Never.
Your husbands a funny son of a bitch,you know that, Betty?
Yeah.
We used to swim in a quarry.
By the way you drop your Gsevery once in a while,
I always thoughtyou were raised on a farm.
Someplace with a swimmin hole.
What do you say we goto a commercial break...
brought to you by more liquor?
You two.
Oh. Jesus, dont tell meits your anniversary.
- No.- Dont worry.
Sally got this frosting machine.
Oh. "Mommy and Daddy. "
Simple, to the point, colloquial.
She writes like her father.
Ill get hers. You get your own.
Three on a match.
Never understood that.
Is that like three on a horse?
Trench w*r. First w*r.
They used to say,"First man lights up, they notice you.
"Second man, Jerry takes aim.
Third one... Auf wiedersehen. "
But the professional wisdomsays that one of our guys
came up with that,as a way to sell matches.
You tell your kids theres no Santa Claus?
Hed never do that.
Tell us another story.A true one, though.
Well, my father was in the trenches.
With a bayonet.
Think about that.
Poking a man to deaththree feet away from you.
What does that sound like?
Don never talks about the w*r.
The w*r? His w*r, you mean.
Not much to say.
You boys used up all the glory.
We did, didnt we?
Course, my old man will alwayshave one on me with that bayonet.
My biggest hit camewhen we were running oil
down to the islandsin the South China Sea.
The Pacific was all about gasoline.
People forget that.
You know what?I dont like to talk about it, either.
Oh, dear. Im sorry.
Not much.
Now you have to tell us.
Well, the third day we picked upa Dinah circling the convoy.
A recon plane.
They were mapping us for the Nip su1c1desubmarines up ahead...
kaitens... basically, warheads with motors.
Made us feel good to know we hadsuch a dedicated enemy.
Thats one way of thinking about it.
Maybe I was bored, but I thought,We should get that little plane.
Bored? What about scared?
That never comes in to these stories.
Youre making me look badin front of the lady.
Thats impossible. Finish your story.
Well, we gave it to em.
Right at 12:00.
He was going away from us,but we hit him.
I watched him dive into the wavesjust beyond the horizon.
It was strange, becausewe knew it was over for him,
but we didnt see or hear much.
The next four hours,I took us off course, just to swing by.
Looking for a holein the ocean, I guess.
We saw the wreckage.No chute, no body.
Its incredible that somethingthat heavy can float.
Isnt that something?
- Bet they gave you a medal.- They did.
But not for that. It was for drinking.
Can something be doneabout this sadness?
Want to switch to gin?
Did you check the golf bag?
I have something out in the garageleft over from New Years.
I dont care if it has ants in it.
Roger, please, the kids.
Sally will be happyher cake was such a hit.
Make sure you tell her
I ate the "M" in "Mom. "
- Roger...- I cant believe youve had two babies.
Dont do that.
Youve been making eyes at me all night.
You cant tell me that Imnot giving you hot pants.
You smell so good.
I can make more coffee.
I just want you to knowthat when I go to sleep tonight,
I will be thinking all about you.
Whered you go, to Russia to get that?
No, I ran down the streetknocking on doors.
Come on, you two. Come on out hereand wish me a bon voyage.
I was just sayingwhat a lucky man you are.
Beautiful children. Enjoy it.
One minute youre drinking at a bar,
and they come and tell youyour kids been born,
next thing you know,theyre heading off to college.
Well, I should be on my way.
Ill take this for the road.
Ill walk you out.
Magical night.
Thats my car.
There you go.
Lights!
- What was that?- What?
That. Him.
Felt like someone turned the oven onwhen I came back in here with that bottle.
- Thats ridiculous.- Bullshit.
Nothing happened, Don.
Other than your drunk bossruining our evening.
Can we leave it at that?
You seemed to be having a grand time.
I liked the wine.
You made a fool of yourself.
Why would you say that?
You were throwing yourself at him.Giggling at his stories.
I was being friendly. Hes your boss.
I dont like to be treated that wayin my own home.
I know what I saw.
You want to bounce me off the walls?
Would that make you feel better?
Sometimes I feel likeIm living with a little girl.
Humps, where were you last night?
I had a dinner with my in-lawsat the Four Seasons... poolside.
Sounds refreshing.
Norman Mailer, Mayor Wagner.
The naked and the dead.
- Whats in the box?- Its a wedding present.
- We got two.- But what is it?
- Its a Chip n Dip.- Let me see.
- Are you serious?- Yeah!
Im might have to goto somebody elses wedding.
I like to know what people are returning.
What?
I dont know what to say.You got two of these?
- What is it?- You have your fingers in your ears?
Its a Chip n Dip.You have your friends over.
You put chips on the sidesand dip in the middle.
- Dip?- Yes.
We went to these peoples house,and they had one.
It had sour cream with theselittle brown onions in it.
It was very good.
Youll have to give methat recipe sometime.
Cost 22 bucks.
- Shit!- So.
Im going to return it.
Today? Freddy Rumsenscousin works at General Mills.
Were all going to Ratazzis for lunch.
- Maybe dinner.- No.
- I have to return this thing.- "Today," she said, Im sure.
I like doing things for her.
Youre right. Im sorry.
When you finish shopping,come join us.
I hear they make a greatGrasshopper, Mildred.
Mr. Draper? Mr. Sterling to see you.
Send him in.
Something for the golf bag.
Thats the good stuff.
I take it you got home in one piece.
I made it as far as the Knights Innoff the Taconic.
I know that place.Its got great water pressure.
Yeah, I slept in the car.
About last night.
What about it?
When a man gets to the pointwhen his names on the building,
he can get an unnaturalsense of entitlement.
What does that mean, Roger?
Youre not gonna make this easy.
I dont even know what this is.
One night, years ago,I got very drunk.
I drive home to my building,
pull into the garage, park at my spot.
I get in the elevator.
Its late. Theres no operator.
Go up to the 12th floor. Get out.
Im walking down the hall.
Its pink and orange.
I remember how ugly it was.
Suddenly, my keywont fit in the door.
Wasnt my building.
I guess what Im saying is, uh...
at some point, weve allparked in the wrong garage.
Thanks for the bottle, Roger.
And?
Bettys going to want that glass back.
Good man.
Maybe I should get a case of those, huh?
This is taking a long time.
Is it that complicated?
Ah, the blue box.You must be a newlywed.
That explains it.
Yes, it does. Adorable.
My husband, hed ratherbe drinking at lunch,
even when we were newlyweds, I think.
Hes in advertising.
Im in advertising. Sterling Cooper.
Hes at BBDO. Media buyer.
Jim Wallace.
Dont know him.
Thats because youre here at lunch.
Next.
Im here to return this.
Theres nothing wrong with it.
We got two.
Thats why we suggest that people register,to avoid duplications.
We did register. We got two.
Do you have your receipt?
It was a gift.
Rosemary, we have a bridal return.
Him?
Bridal registry.
Its a Chip n Dip. We got two.
Thats practically four of something.
Name?
Campbell.
I suppose you dont have a receipt.
Gosh, I wish I did.
No. It was a gift.
Theres nothing here.
Perhaps your wife told youshe was registering
and in the end forgotto give us her name.
Her name?
Yes. Its under the maiden name.
Hmm. Its Vogel.
Why would you do that?
I dont know.
Humps.
Humps the Camel Campbell.
Matherton. What are you doing here?
Getting my racquet restrung.
Mens room back this way?
Down the hall past the water fountain.
What are you doing here?
Returning a wedding gift.
Not mine, I hope.
No, its a Chip n Dip. Trudys aunt.
Thats Trudy Vogel. Do you mind, lovely?
Uh, what is it?
Its a Chip n Dip.
You put chips on the sideand dip in the middle.
For entertaining.
Its a beaut.
Hell of a wedding, by the way.
Your cousin Bethany...bridesmaids bridesmaid.
Connecticut College for Women, indeed.
I think I found it.
Thats nice.
Good to see you.We should do this sometime.
Im coming back for you.
Do you have a receipt?
No. I might have already said that.
It was a gift.
I can give you store credit.
I was expecting cash.
Im sorry.
Isnt there a way we could work this out?
Let me by you a drink.
I have an expense account.
The best I can do is putthe store credit in your name
so you can spend it here.
I would think about spending it on youif you gave me cash.
Its $22.
Store credit.
Thank you.
By the way, Matherton...
he has the clap.
Same price as a Chip n Dip.
Amazing.
And I was going to tryto make you feel bad
by telling you whereCarlottas stockings end.
What the hell is that for?
Its for me.
.22 caliber bolt action.
Use it in good health.
Why not?
Boys will be boys, right?
You couldnt hit the sideof St. Patricks with that.
Its good for 20 yards.
Its your 4:30, Mr. Campbell.
The Nixon brain trustis coming in tomorrow.
The nomination is expected as a lock.
All we need is an opponent.
Rumor is Lyndon Johnsonsgoing to be making a play at the Convention,
so we may not be goingagainst Kennedy at all.
Then we have to worryabout the South.
Its going to be Kennedy.
Boston Blackie won West Virginia.
Now, where does that leave us?
"Nixon: Experience in office,knows foreign affairs. "
He probably learned that
when they were throwingrocks at him in Caracas.
"Knows the real threat of communism,home and abroad. "
Hes not helping himselfkeeping quiet on Castro.
True, but hes not a Catholic.
Our hands are tied there.
Nixon thinks hittingthe Catholic thing is a bad idea.
Theyre going to say that.
To us? They believe it.
It hasnt held upin any of the primaries.
Kennedy keeps makingopponents apologize.
For what?
For being intolerant.
This is Dick Nixon were talking about.
You may be too young to remember
the "pink lady" congress... womanfrom California.
He practically sh*t her in the face to win.
If it is Kennedy,
Nixon will lower himselfto the occasion.
Its going to be Kennedy.
Good. Catholic son of a millionaire.
A boy too scared to do anythingbut go on vacation.
I met him. He is a boy.
Hes only four yearsyounger than Nixon.
But has he been sittingnext to the leader of the free world
for twice that time?
Hes inexperienced.
He doesnt even wear a hat.
I dont know.
You know who elsedoesnt wear a hat?
Elvis.
Thats what were dealing with.
Remind me to stophiring young people.
America does not wantsome greasy kid
with his finger on the button.


Now if the adults can weigh in?
"Communism, taxes, health care. "
Kinsey, you want to write this down,or should I call a girl in?
Hi, honey. I made a roast beef.
Just cut the strings.
Oh, roast beef?
You know its just me tonight, right?
That was a wedding giftfrom my Aunt Letty!
And you go and get some stupid toy?
I cant believe you!
That was for us!
Youre always telling me to grow up.
I cant believe you!
Oh, I can leave it there?
Thanks.
Great. Thank you.
Hollis, let me ask you something.
Uh, Mr. Campbell,
I thought Id take you up on your offerto look at my work.
But if youre in the middle of something...
Whats that?
A wedding present.
I really appreciate it.
You ever been hunting, Peggy?
No, I dont think so.
You either have or you havent.
I went a couple of times with my uncle.
New Hampshire.
I saw my cousin sh**t a rabbitby Coney Island.
Its an incredible sensation.
You have to be very quiet.
Take it down with the first sh*t,
or you scare it away.
And sometimes you have to go upand finish it off.
Then you tie it to the bumper,and you go home.
But you know what Ivealways wanted to do?
I would pick it up...
throw its back legs over my shoulder,
and I would drag it through the snowto this little cabin.
And there...
Id hang it up...
between a couple of trees,
cut it open,
drain it,
dress it,
and then Id takemy big hunting kn*fe,
and Id cut this loinright out of the side.
And Id go into the cabin,
and thered be this womanwaiting for me,
standing by one of those old stoves
with a big black pipe,
and Id hand it to her,
and shed put it in a cast-iron k*ll,
and then Id sit at the table...
and shed bring it to me.
And Id wipe my kn*fe on my knee...
and then I would eat itwhile she watches.
That would be wonderful.
Ill take a look at this for you.
Thank you.
Can I get a ham sandwich?
You know what?Ill take a cherry Danish.
The big one in the back.
Thank you, maam. There you go.
Helen. Hello.
Hi, Betty.
How are you?
Im well.
And hows Glen?
I wasnt going to say anything.
I was just going to go right on by.
Whats wrong?
I was going...
I was going through Glenstreasure box the other day,
and I found a lock of blonde hair.
Your hair, he says.
Well, I dont know what he told you.
Glen doesnt lie, not when hes caught.
- Im not saying its a lie.- Betty.
He asked me for it.
And you gave it to him?
He is 9 years old.
What is wrong with you?
He was a bold manthat first ate an oyster.
I believe that was Jonathan Swift.
Are we naming them now?
Look at you.
I had no idea you weresuch a fan of the mollusk.
Never gave them a chance before,but Im acquiring a taste.
Its like eating a mermaid.
Ready for another,or have you topped off your t*nk?
Youre leading this dance.
Well, what the hell? Its the G.O.P.
Theyll never smell itover the stench of Brylcreem.
Another round.
Wait. Are you still good with these,
or do you prefer your beloved rye?
Today Im on the Roger Sterling diet.
Easy on the vermouth,another dozen of these.
Me, as well.
Ive always thought you werea man who could keep up, Don.
Anything else, gentlemen?
Did you knowthey served cheesecake
to the Olympic athletesin ancient Greece?
So whats an extra lap or twoaround the steno pool for us?
Two cheesecakes.
And dont let me seethe bottom of this glass.
What were we talking about?
Oh, yes, the Russians.
sh**ting those dogs into space.
I believe we branded them cat loversand moved on to the subject of true love.
Right. Desi and Lucy... please.
Hes divorcing her again.
Did he wake up one morning and say"Oh, yeah, I forgot, I hate you"?
What makes a man marrythe same woman twice?
I believe in his case,
it was the lure of orange hair.
I like redheads.
Their mouths are like a dropof strawberry jam in a glass of milk.
I think I woke my ulcer up.
Drinking milk.
I never liked it.
I hate cows.
You keep matching me like this,
youll have an ulcerof your own, any day now.
One more?
Instead of coffee?
Sure.
But then we should get the check.
Hey, Birdie. I have the shirt.
What is this?
Bobby spilled some Concord grape juicedown the front of it.
I washed it.
Uh, this is Ernies shirt, not Bobbys.
Well, what do you know?
Oh, did you have a partyyou didnt invite me to?
Ill invite you. Its going to be a dinner party.
Im just trying the wine, you know.
Develop my palate.
Do you want some? Its a split.
Theres another glass.
How are you?
Im good.
Maybe I will try some.
Betty,
Jill Sandifer wasin the market earlier today.
What?
Is it true?
Youre my friend, Francine.
Are you coming over here to do recon?
Im worried about you.
I dont know what happened.
I kept thinking in the caron the way back,
"Did that really happen?"
And...
then I just put it out of my mind.
Well, what did happen?
Whatever you heard.
I mean, I dont even want to hear it.
I have my own version,and its plenty.
Its okay.
Honestly, I dont know anyone
who wouldnt wantto take a good poke at her.
Shes so selfish.
Those long walks
and that pathetic jobat Bensons Jewelry.
Carlton went in thereto buy me some earrings.
Im sure she loved that.
When I saw the Bensons Jewelrywrapping paper,
I almost threw it in his face.
And that John Kennedy. I hate him.
Really?
What will people think?
I think theyll be gladto know youre not a marshmallow.
Do people think Im weak?
No. Its just youre so sweet and perfect.
Im not.
Well, it does seem that way.
Look, itll all be forgotten.
We dont have to includeHelen Bishop anymore.
Let her knowwhose side were all on.
Uh, my mother...
always said,
"Youre painting a masterpiece.
Make sure to hide the brushstrokes. "
She was really beautiful.
Then I think, um...
"Why am I doing all this? Im not that vain. "
What does Dr. Wayne say?
Nothing...
except "Tell me more about that. "
Im still dying to try it.
Im pretty sure Dr. Wayne triedto look down my neckline the other day.
He sits behind me.
And as far as Im concerned,as long as men look at me that way,
Im earning my keep.
Then every once in a while,
I think...
No.
This is something else.
I dont want my husband to see this.
I love to be looked at that way.
You should get out of here.
Nap time is about to end.
Well, Im just glad youre okay.
We havent gone over the Nixon plan.
You prepared, right?
In what way?
Im sorry, gentlemen.
Mr. Sterling, Mr. Draper,Im waiting for service.
So am I. What are you talking about?
Were out of order.
Oh, crap.
When will they be back up?Should we wait?
Weve got our best man on it.
Thats a comfort.
Jesus, were already late.
Im terribly sorry, Mr. Sterling.
Its certainly a believable excuse.
We could go back to lunch.
No. Cooper would have a seizure,if he hasnt already.
So?
Ah, this is ridiculous. A building this big.
What if there was a fire?
Wed be walking down.
It would be easier.
Maybe we should check the elevator.
Maybe its up again.
I think wed hear it go on in the stairwell.
You think?
Roger, I dont know.
Maybe theyre late, too.
Maybe we could get them to come down
and have the presentationon the eighth floor landing.
Theres plenty of seats.
Damned elevator.
What do you want to do?Were almost there.
The hell we are.
Well, we can waste another five minutestalking about it, if you want.
Lets go.
Get behind me with that thing.
Six to go.
Ive been counting.
You want to rest a minute?
No, sir. No, I dont.
Keep moving.
I forgot. Navy man.
I love redheads.
With big breasts.
Well find you one if we still have jobs.
Want me to run ahead?
Run?
My names on the building.
They can wait for me.
I got to stop talking.
Im fine.
Just lost my tie clip.
Ill find it. Go on.
You sure?
I said go on.
Found it!
- Where the hell were you?- Elevators out.
- Thats quite a hike. Wheres Sterling?- Hes coming.
Well, here are the troops now.
Lou, Michael, Charlie, uh, Don Draper.
Hey, Don.
Our creative muscle.
Hopefully, a little brains, too.
Sorry to keep you fellas waiting.
The elevators out.
Pete Campbell, of course.
Weve spoken on the phone.
Yeah, yeah.
Hell continue handling things for you.
And when I say handling,I mean he runs everything by me.
And, of course, uh,my partner, Roger Sterling.
We heard the elevators down.
Those boys over at United Fruit
talk about you like youinvented the damn banana.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You all right, Roger?
Get us some ice water.
Oysters.
I can see that.
23 floors.
Im just sorry I missed this lunch.
We were with some Quakers.Had cottage cheese.
Well, lets let Roger regroup.
- Okay.- Yeah.
This way.
Ill be right in.
You okay?
Yeah.
Fine.
Good.
