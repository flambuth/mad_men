Sorry Im late.
Thats okay. I was occupied.How are you today, Don?
Im well, Connie.Thank you. How are you?
Im afraid I have some serious businessto discuss. Have a seat.
I was at McCann Erickson yesterday,and they let me know
that effective January 1theyre buying Putnam, Powell & Lowe.
What?
Im sorry, but that meansIm going to have to move
- my New York properties elsewhere.- Why?
Because P.P.L. Owns Sterling Cooper.Youre all gonna be part of McCann.
- So were all gone.- Sterling... I dont know.
Cooper will definitely be put on an ice floe.
But youre a prize pig.Youll make more money, pick up stock.
You wont have to live and diewith every account.
Bullshit. Its a sausage factory.I turned them down three years ago.
This happens all the time, Don.Its business.
Id ask them to put youon the Caribbean hotels,
but I dont thinkIm gonna stay there much longer.
- You come and go as you please.- Yes, I do.
And you dont give a crap that my futureis tied up in this mess because of you?
You wanted my account,and you were lucky to get it.
And you wanted to play with me.
Kick me around, knock me down to sizewhile you called me "son. "
I get it now, Connie. Its business.
You know,
I got everything I have on my own.
Its made me immune to thosewho complain and cry because they cant.
I didnt take you for one of them, Don.
Are you?
- Some other time well try again.- Yes.
Have a nice holiday.
Sixty-nine cents a bushel.
- Thats half last year.- We aint gonna make it.
Its as fair a shake as we could get,
considering that Allotment Actmade no allotment for wheat.
You were supposed to get us a good deal.
Theres a surplus.What the hells he supposed to do?
- Well, I aint selling at that.- Youve got no choice.
Sure I do. Ive got a silo.Store it till winter when the price goes up.
- How you gonna pay your mortgage?- Thats none of your concern.
- Settle down. Were all in this together.- No, we aint, thanks to you.
- I take care of mine. You take care of yours.- Damn it, Whitman, this is a cooperative.
No more.
Now get out of my kitchen.
Whats so urgent that you had to wake me?
Conrad Hilton told me P.P.L.Is being sold and us along with it.
- So you knew about this?- No, but it makes sense.
- All that short-term thinking.- So what do we do?
Theres nothing to do. I have a contract.You have a contract. Roger has a contract.
So thats it?
Youre losing your businessand you dont care?
- I lost my business last year.- Well, do something about it.
If Sterling Cooper is for sale,why dont we buy it from P.P. L?
We could put everything backthe way it was.
Young men love risk becausethey cant imagine the consequences.
And you old men lovebuilding golden tombs
and sealing the rest of us in with you.Youre done. You know that, right?
So I should just throw away my fortune?
I dont have the rest of my lifeto earn it back.
- I understand. Ill let you get back to sleep.- Why do you care?
Because Im sick of being batted aroundlike a ping-pong ball.
Who the hell is in charge? A bunch ofaccountants trying to make $1 into $1.10?
I want to work.I want to build something of my own.
How do you not understand that?You did it yourself 40 years ago.
Thats true.
But Im not sure you have a stomachfor the realities.
Try me.
Well, were gonna need accounts.
American Tobacco, thats mostof Sterling Cooper, but thats Roger.
I understand that.
Did Hilton tell you when this blessed eventis supposed to take place?
New Years Day.
- We have to talk to Roger now.- You talk to him.
Do you want to do this or not?
Honey...
Honey, he probably feels bad aboutthe president getting sh*t on his watch.
Now, stop reading the paper.Shes obsessed.
Its the most interest that girls ever hadin a book depository.
McCann is buying P.P.L.,
and is absorbing Sterling Cooperalong with it.
- What?- Conrad Hilton told me this morning.
Christ. From one johns bed to the next.What a joke.
Don and I have been discussing the ideathat we buy the company back.
- Really? Why?- Because we dont want to go to McCann.
And now youre sniffing aroundbecause I have a golden pork chop
dangling from my neck.
Its more than that.You know Berts done for.
Now its about Bert, huh?
I want to see what you look likewith your tail between your legs.
You sold your birthrightso you could marry that trollop.
Here we go. This is your pitch?Well, move along.
Im not gonna throw it all away becausehe doesnt want to work at McCann.
You want to work there?
You dont value what I doany more than they do.
I was wrong. I learned that with Hilton.I can sell ideas, but Im not an account man.
Youre not good at relationships,because you dont value them.
- I value my relationship with you.- You do now.
I do.
Im sorry. Ive got points, stock.
If Im useless, so be it.
Theres a deck chair somewherewith my name on it.
Youre right, Roger. If youve lostyour appetite, you should retire.
Of course, Ive seen that before.So have you. Men my age, even younger,
they play golf, go on vacation,lose their appetite.
In three years...
Join or die?Jesus, Bert, he was doing better.
- You know its true.- Youre still gonna outlive me.
We have to try.
So you do want to bein advertising after all.
Go upstairs.
- Daddy just got home.- Ill be up.
- Do you want me to go, too?- Please sit down.
I made an appointmentwith a divorce attorney,
and I suggest you do the same.
Come on, Betts.What are you doing seeing a lawyer?
I want to be civilized about this.Please dont act surprised.
You havent been yourself.
Maybe you need to see a doctor.A good one this time.
Because Id have to be sickto want out of this?
Youve had a tough couple of weeks.We all have.
Ive had a tough year.
I felt I should tell you ratherthan just let you get a phone call at work.
Well, forget it.Im not gonna let you break up this family.
I didnt break up this family.
Lane, please shut the door and have a seat.
Certainly.
We know McCann Erickson bought P.P.L.,
and we know that makesSterling Cooper chattel.
Who told you that?
Someone outside of this buildingwho knows.
Well, theyre wrong.
Lane, weve worked next to each otherfor a year.
Dont act like a stranger. Weve got tea.
Well, I supposeyoull find out soon enough,
but your informationisnt completely correct.
Only Sterling Cooper is being sold.P.P.L., well, will remain P.P.L.
That doesnt change our plans.We want to buy back the company.
Were willing to offerthe purchase price plus 12%.
- Its worth more than that now.- What did you get?
Im not going to say, but more than that.
I apologize you had to find out this way.Believe me, it wasnt my decision.
Ive quite enjoyed it here.
Well, theyve only got me for a year.You for what? Three?
Well make another run at it.
The only grounds for divorce in this stateare absence of a spouse,
incurable insanity,life imprisonment or adultery.
Well, he hasnt been faithful.
Do you have any witnessesor corroboration?
Not really.
It wouldnt matter anyway,with both parties at fault.
- No. We havent... We arent...- Ken. Ken, what are you doing?
You think the governor needsanother scandal on the ticket?
I am sorry for presuming, Mrs. Draper.That was wrong.
- So what do I do?- I know its hard to understand,
but the state of New Yorkdoesnt want anyone to get divorced.
Thats why people go to Reno. Its painless.
I met my second wife. You stay therefor six weeks to establish residency.
Mr. Draper doesnt even need to go,just consent.
I see.
We need to discuss what you wantin terms of settlement.
- Whatever Im entitled to.- Give us a second.
- You dont need what he can provide.- Henry, I have three children.
Ill take care of them,and Ill take care of you.
I dont want you owing him anything.
We want to get this doneas soon as possible.
- Saint John, Im glad I caught you.- What is it?
Mr. Sterling, Cooper and Draperhave learned of the sale.
- What do they know?- It was a mixture of truth and half truth.
They knew about McCann,but they were under the belief
that P.P.L. Was being sold as well.
- And what did you tell them?- That they were wrong.
They even wanted to bidfor Sterling Cooper.
12% above our purchase price.
Listen, I apologize, Lane.Obviously the news is getting out.
- What news?- P.P.L. Is being sold as well.
What? Why wasnt I told?
Didnt seem pertinent. Trying to keepour company calm as well as theirs.
- Well, wheres my place in this?- With McCann, I suppose.
There, there, Lane. They knowyoure essential to the transition.
- And then what?- Youll prove yourself irreplaceable.
You always do.
Lane.
- Yes?- Dont be disheartened.
- Ill put in a good word for you.- Thank you.
No, thank you.
Weve got a month till winter,then well be set.
This is what I showed the manfrom the bank today.
What are they gonna do? Sell this place?
The banks gonna get their paydayright after me.
We got nothing,and were about to have less.
Fine! Ill sell.
Ill sell my crop for nothing. Dick.
- What are you doing?- Ill drive it to Chicago tonight.
Youre drunk.
Go. He can barely stand.
Calm down.
Whoa! Here.
Calm down.
It aint gonna rain.
Pa! Daddy! Daddy!
Your guests have arrived.
Close the door. Have a seat.
- Whats he doing here?- Youre gonna read us your will?
- I want the Cadillac.- I couldnt sleep.
And I thought,why dont we go to McCann directly?
- Because you cant. Its done.- Youre not even gonna ask?
I did, yesterday.
And you were right. P.P.L. Is being sold,so it seems were all going to McCann.
They cut you loose.
I want you to find outwhat the price was and give us a sh*t.
Enough. I should fire you for even tryingto involve me in this conspiracy.
Go ahead.Its the only thing you did well here.
- Don, let it go.- I did a great many things here.
Have another. Its 9:30, for Gods sake.
Jesus, thats right.
You have absolute authority to fire anyone.
Fire us.
Fire us. Sever our contracts. Let us go.
- Can you do that?- Why would I?
Because once this sale goes through,
youll be thrown overboard, and youll bea corpse knocking against their hull.
Nothing good ever camefrom seeking revenge.
Nonsense. Well make you a partner.
I should think this is worth more than that.
So were negotiating.
- Well put your name on the door.- I dont know.
- Do you know how to do what he does?- I dont.
It could be done, but getting you, us,out of here isnt the difficult part.
- We need accounts.- Lets say we have Lucky Strike.
And although thats, lets see,$23 million in billings...
Twenty-four.
- Wed still need another third for cash flow.- Well, I cant take anyone else
or Lee Garner, Sr. Wont thinkthat hes special. What about Hilton?
- No.- Can we get any of our other accounts?
Well get them.
If I were to send a telex in at noon todaythat youve all been sacked,
its after close of business in London.
It would remain unnoticeduntil Monday morning there, 2:00 a. m. Here.
That gives us today and the weekendto first gather accounts
and then a skeleton staff to service them.And of course we would have to obtain
all the materials requiredfor continuity of service.
Obtain? We have to steal everything.
Anyone approached must be a certainty.
If news spreads, theyll lock us out.
Do we vote or something?
Well, gentlemen, I suppose youre fired.
Well, its official.Friday, December 13th, 1963.
Four guys sh*t their own legs off.
Allison, Mr. Pryce has requestedan office-wide memo.
"The office is closed this weekend.All work suspended. Carpet cleaning. "
- Can you get me Mr. Campbell?- He didnt come in today. Hes sick.
Call his house. Its important.Peggy, my office.
What do I bring?
Shut the door. Sit down.
I know we have to roll out Western Unionby New Years.
- I dont have art. Theres no one there.- Theyre selling the company.
- Again?- Im starting a new agency.
I need you here Sunday eveningto get your things
and to help us collectwhatever accounts we end up taking.
- Really?- Yes.
- Who else is going?- Why do you need to know that?
- Because its important.- I cant tell you.
Peggy, we are being bought my McCann.Do you know what that means?
You just assume Ill do whatever you say.
Just follow you like some nervous poodle.
- Im not gonna beg you.- Beg me? You didnt even ask me.
Fine, Im asking you.
Ive had other offers, you know,
that came with a sales pitchabout opportunity.
Everyone thinks you do all my work.
Even you.
I dont want to make a career out of beingthere so you can kick me when you fail.
- I guess Ill have to talk to Kurt and Smitty.- I guess so.
- Where the hell are my pajamas?- Will you please relax?
Trudy, I called in sick todaybecause I had my interview with Ogilvy.
- I have to look sick.- You do.
- What a pleasant surprise.- Sorry to drop in.
- How are you?- Better than my husband.
And how are you?Weve been calling all day.
- May I take your coats?- Were fine.
Im going to change the sheets.
- Is everything okay?- McCann bought P.P.L., and us.
- What? Again?- We need to talk to you. Its serious.
Were not firing you.
Am I getting a few more adjectivesadded to my title?
- Dont bother. I have other plans.- Peter, may I speak to you for a moment?
Pete, were starting a new agency.Were here to talk to you about joining us.
Wait a minute. Theyre letting you go?
Keep it to yourself,but Im taking American Tobacco.
We need another 7-10 million in billingsfor cash flow or something.
What do you havein your saddlebag so far?
I dont have a saddlebag.I dont know what youre talking about.
Pete, I dont blame you for bailing out,the way youve been treated.
- So Kenny turned you down?- We havent spoken to Ken yet.
And yes, we want your accounts,but we also want your talent.
Really? And what are my talents?
- Youll do what it takes.- No.
I want to hear it from him.
Its not hard for me to say, Pete.You saw this coming. We didnt.
In fact, youve been aheadon a lot of things.
Aeronautics, teenagers, the n*gro market...
We need you to keep us looking forward.
I do, anyway.
I want to be a partner,and I want my name in the lobby.
Theres not gonna be a lobby.
North American Aviation, Secor Laxatives,Gillette, jai alai, maybe Pampers.
Thats close to 8 million already.I dont think you get conditions.
Well make you a partnerif you can deliver by Sunday.
Sunday?
Well leave the name and the title as a goal.Like it or not, that works with you.
Id like to say Ill think about it,but I dont think thats an option, is it?
Im not really sick.
Welcome aboard.
- Good night, Trudy.- Good night, gentlemen.
- What if I come up short?- Thats not an option.
Good night.
I want you to call Hubert Adams at Secor.His numbers in my Rolodex.
I threw it under the bed. Try him at home.
Tell him Ill meet him at the St. Regis at 7:30and sound like a secretary.
I have to get dressed.


- I cant believe he was gonna leave.- That little shit.
Look, they still have a pictureof Kennedy up.
Although, what are they gonna do?Take it down and put up Lyndon Johnson?
Not in this place.
Ive acted like Ive started a businessmy whole life, but I inherited it.
I need an attorney.
- Divorce.- So its true, huh?
- What are you talking about?- Henry Francis.
- Who?- Jesus.
- Right when things were almost normal.- I need you to tell me what you know.
Margarets friends with his daughter.
- Are they sleeping together?- I dont know.
It came from his daughter.He talks about her.
It sounds like its serious.I was gonna tell you. No, I wasnt.
I thought you knew.
Im sorry I told you. Believe me.
I am sorry about that.
Wake up.
- Hes sleeping.- I dont care.
Who the hell is Henry Francis?
No one.
- Stop it. Stop it!- Who the hell is he?
- Why do you care?- Because youre good,
and everyone else in the world is bad.
- Youre drunk.- Youre so hurt.
So brave with your little white nosein the air.
- All along youve been building a life raft.- Get out.
- You never forgave me.- Forgave what?
- That Ive never been enough?- You got everything you ever wanted.
Everything! And you loved it.
And now Im not good enoughfor some spoiled mainline brat?
Thats right!
You wont get a nickel.
And Ill take the kids.God knows theyll be better off.
Im going to Reno,
and youre going to consent,and thats the end of this.
Dont threaten me. I know all about you.
Youre a whore.
You know that?
I want you out of the house.
Hold the elevator.
- They called you in, too?- Yes, they did.
- Ill admit it. Im a little scared.- Of what?
- Why are you here?- I dont know. Cooper called me.
First theyre cleaning the carpets,now theyre not. Why are you here?

Wed like you to join usas our new head of media.
- Are you kidding?- Yes. Yes, we are. Happy birthday.
We need your answer.
- I should really call my wife.- Mr. Crane... Harry.
This matter is secret and time-sensitive.If you turned us down and elect to be
a mid-level cog at McCann Erickson,
well have to lock you in the storeroomuntil morning.
Im sure you understand.
Pete.
We were hopingyou could decipher these job sheets.
- Where exactly are these materials?- I never look at these.
Cant we just take everything?
Thats good thinking,but we dont know where anything is.
No one knows how this works?
Let me make a phone call.Ill take care of this.
- No. No more conspirators.- Ill be discreet.
Wheres Don?
What did we do?
- Nothing.- Then why are we in the living room?
We want to tell you something, because...
Well, its going to be a little bit of a change.Your father is going to be moving out.
Now, well still be living here,and hell come to visit.
- Then why is he going?- Because...
Itll just be temporary.
- Like when you lived in the hotel?- Yes.
Itll be different.
- Is it because I lost your cufflinks?- No, it has nothing to do with you.
Thats not what I mean.
- I love you both. You know that.- Then why are you going?
Im not going.
Im just living elsewhere.
Thats going.You say things and you dont mean them,
- and you cant just do that.- Sally, sweetheart.
- Go away.- Sally, stop it.
You said youd always come home.
I will.
Its just a different home.
Will you be here for Christmas?
- Youll get to have two Christmases.- I only want one.
Did you make him leave?
No. We both decided it.
You made him sleep in Genes room,and its scary in there.
Listen to me, both of you.
I will be here. You can call me,and I will answer and I will be here.
- Sally. Sally.- Let her go.
Please dont go. I dont want you to.
Nobody wants to do this.
But I need you to be a big boy.
- You look awful.- Can I come in?
Do you want anything?
Yes, I do.
You were right.
Ive taken you for grantedand Ive been hard on you,
but only because I think I see youas an extension of myself.
And youre not.
- Well, thank you for stopping by.- Please. Sit down.
Do you know whyI dont want to go to McCann?
Because you cant work for anyone else.
No.
Because there are people out therewho buy things, people like you and me,
and something happened.
Something terrible.
And the way that they saw themselves
is gone.
And nobody understands that.
But you do.
And thats very valuable.
Is it?
With you or without you, Im moving on.
And I dont know if I can do it alone.
Will you help me?
What if I say no?
Youll never speak to me again.
No.
I will spend the rest of my lifetrying to hire you.
Mrs. Harris, what a pleasure to see you.
- What is she doing here?- I said Id be discreet.
- Tell them what to do.- I made a list and I called some movers.

Yes. Of course youll need the job bagson all these accounts.

I never saw myself workingin a place like this.
Dont bother.

Hes waiting on the line.Its his third attempt.
Saint John, how are you?
What in Gods nameis going on over there?
I think at this point it should be very clear.
Youre fired. Youre fired for costingthis company millions of pounds.
Youre fired for insubordination!Youre fired for lack of character!
Very good. Happy Christmas. Mr. Hooker.
Ive been sacked. Please have my officeand things put in storage at this address.
