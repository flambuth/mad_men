Id put you through that window.
Last season on Mad Men.
Hes leaving me for a secretary.
I want you to be my wife.
Youve an office.Im the Head of the Tv.
Damn it Don.I know you having an affair.
- Its okay.- Greg! No.
Its man
Dont come home. I dont carewhat you do. I just dont want you here.
What if I were to bring youevery account of Sterling Cooper?
I ruined everything.
I had your baby.
- And I gave it away.- Why would you tell me that?
You bought us.We dontt expect autonomy.
Im pregnant.
Do you know how hard Ive prayed?
Why does he make me suffer?
God will give you a child.
Let me see her.
So you k*ll another one.
Because you had nothingto do with this.
Maybe you ought to stay off heronce in a while.
Get out, you witch!
Ive got 85,
and my boots are off.
You dont have a sheep.
Ill get one,
but thatll be another quarter
and this is all I have.
Go wash yourself.
You get me in trouble
Im gonna cut your dick offand boil it in hog fat.
Im gonna cut his dick off...
Im gonna cut his dick offand boil it in hog fat.
What was that, sweetheart?
Im cold.
Do you want to hold him?
Im gonna cut his dick offand boil it in hog fat.
Its midnight.
What do you want?
I told you God would giveyou a child.
Whose is it?
Is your husband home?
God is giving you a child.
His name is Dick,
after a wish his mothershouldve lived to see.
Come on. Drink this.
You know, theres no pointin both of us not sleeping.
She wakes up at nightwhen I drop off.
Are you so sure its a girl?
Well, believe me,she knows what she wants.
I packed your valise.
- I could have done that.- Well, youll get a chance...
The clasp was broken.
Carla said she saw Sallyhitting it with a hammer.
Shes taken to your toolslike a little lesbian.
Am I ever going to sleep again?
At least you dont look tired.
I just want everythingto be perfect.
I want her to comeinto our home at its best.
Close your eyes.
Youre on a warm sandy beach...
Because Im a whale.
Youre on a warm
sandy beach.
You can smell the faint scentof coconut oil.
And as you slide your hands,
you feel that cold patch of sandunderneath the shadow
of your deck chair.
Youre good at this.
Hello?
Yes, but on occasion,
you have to resign yourselfto sleeping where you are.
Thats why they sellsubway tokens, silly.
You look lovely today.
Thank you.
Are you here to see me?
No, Im just verifyingsome information.
Thank you, lola.
He just always stopsby concerning the strangest things.
- Yesterday it was my engagement ring.- Enough, Lola.
You know theres somethingabout the way he talks.
I could listen to himread the phone book.
When he gets to "s"
I need Howard Sullivanat Lever Brothers.
Remarkable.
I picked it for its sensuality,
but it also in some way
reminds me of our business.
Who is the man who imaginedher ecstasy?
Who indeed?
We were just talking about you.
Burts on his way. Wheres Roger?
Probably taking anotherGrecian treasure out of its crate.
I apologize for Baltimore.
It has to be done.
Its a sales call.Isnt there more I can do here?
Its not a sales call.
Youre the face of our business.
They need someone they can trust.
London fog...
How ludicrous.
Really? I have one.
- So do I.- No, of course...
Its just the name.
There is no fog in London.
There is no London fog.
- Are you sure about that?- Quite.
Never was.
It was the coal dustfrom the industrial era...
Charles Dickens and whatnot.
Mr. Cooper, Mr. Peterson ishere to see you.
- Come on in, Burt.- Hey, Don.
Bert, Lane.
We need you to have a seat, Burt.
You got a blindfold too?
This isnt easy.
It really isnt.
Oh God.
I really thought Id made it.
I know its unkind,but its generous and its fair.
Why the hell did you wait so long?
It was brought to our attentionthat your wife was undergoing radiation.
We thought it decent to wait.
That was decent.
Sorry Im late.
Did I miss anything?
Sad meeting.
Sorry about that.
It wasnt easy.
Well see how you dowithout my Rolodex.
- Were going to take that risk.- You make me sick.
Youre the dying empire.
- Were the future.- Burt, control yourself.
Im the Head of Accounts, damn it!
Im sure well regret it.
Im serious.
See you on the bread lines, fellas.
Is that the last of it?
Because I dont like how muchIm getting to used to these.
I dont know anythingyou dont know.
You understand theres no point everin making over $40,000
when youll be taxed 69%?
Youre working for them.And God forbid you really make it...
- Everything over 70 grand is 81%.- Even if youre married?
Fellow comrades in mediocrity,
I want you to listenvery carefully.
You can all go straight to hell.
I heard hes goingin-house at Nabisco.
- Youre sure its not starting again?- Mr. Campbells office.
- What?- Ill let him know.
- The firings.- Mr. Campbell,
Mr. Pryce wants to see you.
Im at lunch.
Ill bring you a doggy bag.
Holy crap.
You couldnt have pulled measide to say that?
Im sure its nothing.
How the hell am I supposedto live like this?
Drop dead, you limey vulture!
Son of a bitch!
I assume you can continuehandling this beautifully
while I dispense psychotherapyto the girls in the pool.
You americans dont knowhow to handle your emotions.
- Its unbecoming.- His wife is sick,
and if you had talked to his girl,she wouldve informed him.
So he wouldve had a long walkto Mr. Coopers?
And if you had talked to me,I would have been waiting with his coat
and his Rolodex.
While wereon the topic of decorum,
Id like to speak to you about the wayIm being addressed.
Could you be more specific?
The switchboard. Im not John.
Im Mr. Hooker.
Thats the way theyve been taughtto address the secretaries.
As Ive explained,in Great Britain...
A truck is a lorry,and an elevator is a lift.
Ive got it, mr. Hooker.
Despite your title,you are not a secretary.
Im Mr. Pryces right arm.
Im not his typist.
Of course.
I assume you will let him know whenMr. Peterson has left the building.
- How are we today?- Very well, thank you.
Burt Petersons left the agency.
- Really?- Yes.
I cant speak for everyone here,
but I like you.
And I like you.
But you dont know me.
But I will make that effort if giventhe opportunity.
Pardon?
I apologize that I havent beenmore welcoming, socially.
It seemed untilyour wife arrived...
I didnt want to make it awkwardwith a threesome.
Although, now that I think of it perhapsyour being alone is all the more reason
- I shouldve offered my hospitality.- Do have a seat.
Why?
Is something wrong?
I dont know. You just removed the headof my department and now
youre offering me a chair.
How cruel of me.
I wanted to inform youthat youre now Head of Accounts.
- Excuse me?- It seemed like the right thing to do,
despite your lack of hospitality.
The specifics are pending,as is the announcement.
Is this really happening?
I need to know its certain.
Oh yes, but...
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Splendid.
Well, it turns outthings are splendid.
- Thats good.- Could you get my wife on the phone?
I have Mrs. Campbell for you.
- How are you sweetheart?- What are you doing?
I told you this morning
Im having luncheon with the docentscommittee from the met.
- How are they?- Since when do you care?
Since I was made Head of Accounts.
Oh my goodness.
- Thats wonderful!- It really is.
I knew it would happenone day for real.
I love the soundof your voice right now.
Thats because Im already drunk.
Good for you.
Just one more minute.My husband got some good news.
Make a reservation.
Surprise me.
I should call my mother.
Dont go to the well.Theres no water there.
I dont even knowif Im getting a raise.
I didnt ask. I forgot.
Thats very noble. You see?
One doesnt need moneyto be fulfilled.
Dont let those ladiesfrom the met hear you say that.
I should go.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch.
I heard you wanted to see me,so I grabbed a sandwich.
What can I do for you?
Mr. Petersons left the agency.
If thats your news,I think youve been scooped.
So youve heard?
Lets just say he did not"go gentle into that good night."
So youre probably wonderingwhere that leaves you.
Should I be worried?
No, I should say not.
Were making you Head of Accounts.
Spectacular.
Thanks a lot.
Were charting the courseof transition right now.
There are many details to come.
I wouldnt be much of an account man ifI didnt ask what it pays.
I wouldnt be muchof a financial officer
if I wasnt preparedto disappoint you.
Its 21,
but well reevaluate this year.
Ken, this is not for broadcast.
Therell be a formal announcement.
Great.
Can you believe this?
Whats the world coming to?
That is a big bottle.
Thats not a bottle.Thats his date.
"My oh my,what a big bottle you have."
"Im sorry, honey, but Im taken."
"I just pawned my typewriterso we could be together all weekend."
The captains about to announceour descent into friendship.
- Quick refill?- I dont know.
Dont you need somethingto run the plane?
And what about you, mr. Hofstadt?
Excuse me?
I took a look at your luggage.
Youre William Hofstadt?
Bill. Call me bill.
And this is my associate,
mr. Fleischmann.
Are you headed to Baltimore or DC?
- Baltimore.- Well, how about that?
Were headingto hausners for dinner.
You shouldve been in line two hours agoif you want to eat by 8:00.
Lorelei has made some inroadswith the maitre d.
We have to check in and we havean early meeting.
- Where are you staying?- The Belvedere.
Well, this is too much. Us too.
7:30.
Itll be a hoot and a half.
Now you have to takesomeone elses luggage...
Bill Hoffmans.
Hofstadt...
My brother-in-law.
He borrowed a suitcaseto go to Puerto Rico,
but he never tires of putting his nameon other peoples things.
Ive flown a few times,
but Ive never actually seena stewardess that game.
Really?
Any plans tonight?
All I know isto avoid grand central.
I heard Burt Petersonsstill at the bar.
Now now.
It had to happen, I guess.
He didnt put up much of a fight...
Not counting today, I mean.
Its a tough job.
No doubt about that.
I just want to let you know
Ive always beena big fan of your work
and Ive been very vocal about it.
I appreciate that.
Maybe now things willfinally settle down.
Thats true.
Listen, I just want to say
that through all of this
I know that you werethere reminding me that
I can do this job.
Well, youre welcome.
I guess itsbecause I think you can.
- Have a good night.- You too.
And my friend and I were listeningto some radio program
and we hadthis huge bag of fritos...
Were not allowed in uniform...
So at some pointmy friend stops eating,
but I cant.
And I ate allof them and I got so...
It was quite unladylike.
And I still cant eatthem to today.
Too much of a good thing.
It happens.
I think accountingsounds fascinating...
Going through other peoplesbank accounts.
It sounds sexy.
Jesus, Lorelei,
how deep did you have to digto come up with that?
Why would you insulta mans profession?
No, its okay.
I dont usually tellpeople Im an accountant.
Listen,
I didnt meanto insult your profession.
Dont sweat it.
Of course, you do know there aredifferent kinds of accountants.
Are there?
Tell em what we do.
I dont know, Bill.
Im gonna have toswear you all to secrecy.
You cant guarantee that.
Youre right.
Well, someone just brought everythingto a screeching halt.
Well be good.
You ever heard of James Hoffa?
You know, I dont just throwaway newspapers every day.
I also read them.
There is a lot of money missing.
And they dont reallykeep receipts.
So youre a couple of G-men?
No, were accountants.
Isnt the service exquisite?
Im based in New York.Id always rather be there,
but its my job to be out of town.
I dont know.
I keep going to a lot of placesand ending up somewhere
Ive already been.
How about a nightcap?
I dont know.
Your face is red.
Order for us.
Felt self-conscious therefor a moment.
Were the only oneswithout a uniform.
- Good night, Bill.
Its been swelly.
Well, this is me.
Let me see if its differentthan my floor.
What are we doing?
I dont know.
Im engaged.
On the other hand...
You might be my last chance.
Ive been married a long time.
You get plenty of chances.
Its my birthday.
Really?
Is it?
It really is.
Let me see your drivers license.
Thats not gonna help.
Happy birthday.
Hello.
My air conditioner does not work.
It is stagnant in here.
Take your hand out.I cant breathe.
Stand up.
Lorelei thinks you looklike ty power.
You remember him?
Go on.
And while youre distracted,Im gonna take off my shoes.
Is that okay?
Your turn.
Not yet.
Do you like?
Everyones always asking meif I was a model,
but I wasnt.
The one I haveat home is different.
I hope I didnt break it.
No, its fine. Just a minute.
Thank you.
Airplane.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus.
- Whats that?- Fire alarm.
Come on, lets go.
Come on. Forget your shoes.Lets go. Come on.
Come on.
- Do you haveanother cigarette?
Everythings okay, folks!
- Morning.- Morning.
You ever get nervous wearingthat on the subway?
I dont ride the subway.
I do worry aboutbeing followed, though.
I think lola takesa horse and buggy.
Shes never on time.
Im not at work yet.
I dont want to sitin my office and listen
to someone talk abouttheir water retention.
Peggy, brides arevery self-conscious.
If shes so worriedabout getting married,
then why is she shamelessly flirtingwith Moneypenny all the time?
Dont call him that. He hates that.
Are you defending him?
Hes repellant. He reminds meof a doorman.
And the typing she does for him?
God, Im so glad Im gonna be outof here soon.
- Thats very comforting, Joan.- Theres nothing I can do.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Mr. Pryce just called. Theres a meetingfor the Heads of Accounts immediately.
Excuse me?
Mr. Pryce called a big meeting for youand Mr. Cosgrove.
What are you talking about?
Whatever the circumstances,its nice to see you.


Im just here to show you the continuityof our service.
With or without Burt Peterson,you are on our mind.
- I apologize.- Morris, you remember Salvatore Romano.
I dont know how, but I left my planeticket at the hotel.
Hes the guy with the markerwho always does what I say.
- Words, pictures.- Sal, this is Howard.
Pleasure.
I dont remember...
Do you have a family?
Not yet. I have a wife.
Howard is my son. Hes gonna be partof this from now on,
starting with takingyou two gentlemen on a tour.
Thats it?
Youre not gonna say anything?
My father is extremely concernedabout the business right now.
Well, is it about our work?
We dont want to take creditfor everything,
but two of every threeraincoats sold last year
had "london fog" stitchedon the inside pocket.
Dad is worried that everyone
who is ever going to buy a raincoatalready has one.
Because a business hasto get bigger every year.
Thats capitalism.
Well, our worst fearslie in anticipation.
Thats not me, thats Balzac.
Balzac, huh?
You are not Burt Peterson.
Ive been investigatingumbrellas, bags, hats.
There are companiesthat all they do is make hats.
London fog is a 40-year-old brand
that sounds likeits existed forever.
You have established,with our help,
that it meansone thing... raincoats.
New products aside,there will be fat years
and there will be lean years,
but it is going to rain.
Thats true.
Lets see if we canfind you some earplugs.
And now for Mr. Campbell.
- Why does he have Utz?- Some of this was done
based on accounts, some of thiswas done based on relationships.
You figure outwhat happened with Utz.
So you decided all of this?
42 of every dollar at this agencyis spent in the television department.
But no, we did.
- What are these os for?- Olson.
- Shes all over the place.- You know thats not true.
Youre each takinghalf the company.
Of course its possible someone coulddistinguish themselves.
Would be easier that way.
Can you believe this?
If youre upset, you seemto be hiding it.
Im excited. I mean.
I feel badly about Burt Peterson...
Three kids, wife with cancer.
But you greased up the chuteand shoved him down it.
What could possibly be the matter?
Why did you even accept this?You have no interest in this.
Why wouldnt I want this?
Because youre no good.
They want us to hate each other.
I refuse to participate in that.
Very nice.
Very very nice.
Look at you... Never break a sweat.Youre right.
I should just lay down, and we shouldrun together, holding hands.
What time is it?
1:15.
We should be backin the office by 3:00.
Were going back to the office?
Im going to ask you something,
and I want you to be completelyhonest with me.
London fog...
Its a subway car
and theres a commuter looking up.
Theres a girl with her back to us.
Shes wearing one
of those short tan ones,but its open.
Her legs are bare.
We know what hes seeing.
"Limit your exposure."
Thats it.
Good.
Mr. Hooker, may I speak with you?
I thought it was a good ideathat P. P. l. had an office
for when visitors come.
Of course, it would make sensefor someone to be occupying it
in the meantime.
I rustled up an office for you.
I hope you find itappropriate to your status.
My position.
Its near Mr. Pryce.Its not exactly in the thick of things,
but you will have someoneto attend to your typing
to avoid you siphoningoff the man-hours.
My own girl...
- Of my choosing?- I will have a lineup.
Did he take the ant farm?
No, its actually mr. Coopers.It just lives there.
Hello, sweetheart.
Now dont be cross.Ill only be a minute.
- Do you have a fever?- No.
"Peter Campbell."
"The buck stops here!"
"The buck stops here"...
Unless it stops over there.
- Whats the matter?- Theres two Heads of Accounts.
Kenny Cosgroveand I are sharing it.
Im so sorry.
I was sitting thereand they just...
read off a list of names,a list of companies.
Thats my life.
I know you wont like hearing this,
but youre a lot like my father.
Youre an ambitious man,
and an ambitious man isnever happy with what he has.
Why does it alwayshave to be like this?
Why cant I getanything good all at once?
This is an amazing opportunity.
They believe in you.Dont turn it sour.
Its a test.
Why not just cut it shortand tell them I want it?
You can do whatever you want, butthey do not want to hear your outrage.
They want you to b*at Ken.
I know what they want, Trudy.
And honestly,
I dont know.
I cant live with this!
But youll try.
Thats great.
Its a great ad.
So how was everything in Baltimore?
Out of town. Don Draper.
- It was first class.- Go on.
Two old married men.
There was a fire in the hotel,but no casualties.
- Thats too bad.- For casting this lucky fellow
in the subway, whats he look like?
I dont know.
A little excited.
- A little shocked.- No, whats he look like?
Handsome.
Your girls gone.
I have Stolichnaya
and cuban cigars.
I sent them from Greece.
I shouldve tried a pound of opium.
Help yourself.
So Cosgrove versus Campbell.
Is Cooper playing God or Darwin?
I know it sounds japanese,but its not Cooper.
Lane read about itin some management book?
I think it camefrom the home office.
When he told me about it,I thought he was joking.
I told him it was a stupid idea,
but they dont alwaysget our inflection.
Can I speak with you for a moment?
Come in.
What?
I just wanted to let you both know
how honored I amwith this promotion.
Help yourself.
- Not the Stoli.
Hello.
I was going to tell Don,
but I can tell you myself.
I have an old palat the mayors office
that wants to doa small campaign for...
I dont know... Something about
penn station.
Itd be my pleasure.
Is there any brandy?
Any glass will do.
I told him that despite life
under british rule,
we still had
a real yankee.
I dont care what they say...
London fog is a great name.
I like the ants.
Theres no shortageof distractions here.
Now if we can find a proper pub,
well have everything.
Why do you have this office?
I thought it was necessary
that we have placefor when superiors visit.
Of course, it would make sense
for someone to occupy itin the meantime.
Its a hare-brained idea.
We just fired one-thirdof their workforce.
Its unseemly to go throughtheir pockets as well.
A visitors office is good,but you sit out front.
Of course.
It was presumptuous.
This place is a gynocracy.
I hadnt noticed.
My only point is
if you decide to takethe train tomorrow
and you run into Carlton,I told them we were busy.
Our stories are straight.
Sally has something to tell you.
I got it out of her.
Out.
Go ahead.
Im sorry I broke your suitcase.
Find out how much it is to repair,
and itll come outof your allowance.
I dont have an allowance.
Then dont break things.
I just thought...
I just didnt want you to go.
Come here.
I will always come home,
and youll always be my girl.
Your eyes look tired.
I dont sleep wellwhen Im not here.
You squint too much.
You need reading glasses.
Daddy!
Are these for me?
Yes.
Give me that. Its a stickpin.
There you go.
Was I really in there?
Nine months.
Tell me about the day I was born.
Well, it was
the middle of the night
and it was raining
very hard.
I had just come home from work.
He did not feel like getting backin the car,
but he did.
He took my suitcase
and my little stuffed eeyorethat I knew I was going to give you.
