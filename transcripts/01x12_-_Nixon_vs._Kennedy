America is still going to the polls at  :  .
With some precincts opening as early as    this morning,
voters across the country are deciding
who will hold the most important office in the fr...
Herman Phillips, Bert Cooper.
Actually, "Herman" goes on my checks.
People call me Duck.
My research says I was not to call you Duck.
You should have told me that.
I dont know. I like when you say Herman.
Herman was in London with Y&R.
Isnt this a step down?
I dont know.
Moving back to the power center of the universe, New York,
and the chance to put on some weight.
English food. I actually ate a kidney.
He landed American Airlines.
You could make something like that happen here.
Well, you have to spend money to make money.
So youre not promising anything.
Why would I do that?
My goodness, he does want this job.
I hope you play your cards close to the vest with clients.
I will keep that in mind.
Heres a test. Whod you vote for?
If I say Nixon, youll think Im buttering you.
If I say Kennedy, youll want to reform me.
So, uh, Ill say Nixon.
Thats nice to see.
Cooper has a smoker at The Waldorf at  :  .
Marge told me.
   skidoo.
At  :  , we turn on the returns and send for some ice.
Party at the in-laws.
Another ending to a perfect day.
Well, Jennifer and I were going to get tickets to Can-Can.
Its empty, you know.
She says apparently the phone companyis a w*r zone on election night.
Thats what Im hoping for around here.
Although, You better hope thatshes sitting at her switchboard
and not doing what were doing.
Its my wife.
Besides, what if Nixon loses?
Wont that put a damper on things around here?
Who cares? They didnt want our help.
You should care.
I do. It matters for the nation and for Sterling Coop.
But tonight, either way.
If Nixon wins, we win.
If Nixon loses...
let me console you.
Thats him.
Duck Phillips.
I know his name.
Because its Duck?
I grew up with a Tuck.
At least that has an air of dignity.
Don took him to Cooper. Thats a first.
I heard he disintegrated in London.
Got involved with some woman he met at the British Museum.
Her name was Rosetta.
Rosetta Stone.
Hes divorced. Lives in a hotel.
So whats this? His last stop?
No. Hes a k*ll, but hes... hes damaged goods.
Theyre bargain hunting.
Hes the best one Drapers paraded around.
Lets see if Coopers smart enough to know that.
Can I help you?
What?
Can I help you?
Mr. Campbell would like to see you.
Send him in.
Thank you, sweetheart.
So that Duck fellow,
I heard he fell apart in London.
American Airlines.
$  million in billings.
Hes not going to bring that with him.
Listen, Don, I dont feel youve taken meseriously as a candidate.
Candidate for what?
For the head of account services.
We may have had our differences,
but Roger knows Ive done everything I could to emulate him.
Rogers not involved in this.
Anything else?
I have the loyalty of our most important clients:
Calvin Highland, Lee Garner.
These men trust me.
They invite me to their grandchildrens christenings.
When Walter Veidt needed a urologist,
he called me for a recommendation.
Look, youre good at your job. Cooper loves you.
Whats the hurry?
Its been two and a half years.
I could have jumped ship a hundred times.
Is that supposed to persuade me?
I have tremendous value to this company.
Im aware of that.
But I dont think you are.
I am. I just hope you realize that, the way things stand,
there will continue to be someone senior to you.
Why?
What can they offer?
All Im asking is that you think about it.
There are men younger than me with this job at bigger firms.
Cooper sign off on whats-his-name?
Duck?
Ill keep you posted.
Hes got a big lead.
See you at the victory party in the morning.
Absolutely.
Well, good night, Don.
Hes gone!
Olly olly oxen free!
- Do it.- All rightie.
- Whos got the cups?- Oh. Sorry.
With early returns just coming in,
our NBC computer is puttingSenator Kennedys odds for victory
at a grim-sounding   - .
This is not good.
And liquor stores are closed tonight.
Draper has plenty of booze.
We could ask her to join us.
That might soften her up a bit.
I have a bottle of absinthe in my office.
Isnt that illegal?
Its marvelous.
I become incantatory.
And what does that mean?
It means he starts making up words.
Can someone freshen this?
Were not going to make it.
Really?
If I let you into that supply closet,it is not going to be the sack of Rome.
What do we have too much of?
Rum, creme de menthe,
dog biscuits.
May the best man win.
In matters national and... local.
...majority decision of the American...
I made my judgment long ago.
Stop that. Youre going to break it.
Look. Theyre doing math.
What do the numbers say?
Who the president is going to be.
Hello.
Daddy! Hi!
I wasnt expecting you.
I thought you were going to bewatching returns at the office.
What are you doing up?
Mommy said it was okay.
Im watching the news.
Nixon definitely won our precinct.
You should have seen the line.
Mommy said to ask you. Whats the...
Electoral College.
I dont think thats a conversationappropriate for children.
Come here.
Do you want something to eat?
Im going to fix a drink. You?
Im set.
Senator Kennedy seems to be closing the gap
on the vice presidents early lead.
State-by-state, Ohio, Illinois...
Come here.
What?
You better run.
Go, Allison!
White!
Pink!
You can tell me, or I can find out.
What color panties are you wearing?
What? Oh, my G...
Blue!
Who had blue?
Can I walk you home?
I used to think Id find a husband here.
I think Im going to go home.
No, dont go. Its going to be fun.
What are you doing?
Why arent you asleep?
What is that?
Nothing.
Myrna found it on the top of the closet,
and I didnt want to look at it.
My father has a box like that,
and I looked at it when I was a little girl,
and it was a mistake.
So you didnt open it?
Peter, I dont want secrets.
I cant sleep.
I know.
Ive seen it the last few weeks.
Youre not very quiet,
and every time I see the closet door is open
and that box is gone, I know youre out here.
And you never looked in the box?
Its not yours.
What are you doing with it?
I got it by mistake.
So give it back.
Its peculiar.
Its not yours.
Come to bed.
Vice President Nixon seems to have carried
predominantly Catholic Hudson County, New Jersey.
Kinsey, youre a liar.
I couldnt find any absinthe.
Who said you could go in my office?
We were exploring.
But all we found was a large collection of Mad magazines
and this fascinating dramatic piece.
Death is My Client... Whoa.
A play in one act by Paul Kinsey.
Give it to me.
"Peter Tollifson"...
"An animal in the board room and the bedroom."
- Kenny!- Whoa!
Now, remember, hes angry.
Why do I have to play Tollifson?
I wanted to be Galt.
Tollifson is the hero. He thinks.
Galts a thug born on the wrong side of the tracks.
You dont want to be Galt.
Go ahead.
Im sorry. I dont have the pages.
Oh. Sorry.
Um, "I worked with Tollifson for four years.
I shared everything, but I never knew him."
"I thought I knew him.
He used to talk to me."
"I cant control my genius.
Im not some boorish natural like that hack Cosgrove."
Thats crackerjack, Kinsey.
"Your genius be damned."
"Perhaps."
"You can make anyone buy anything.
Anyone but me."
Turn the music down.
We now have confirmation
that the State of Ohio has indeed goneto Vice President Richard Nixon.
Its    electoral votes will go in Mr. Nixons purse.
Im...
Im really tipsy.
I feel awful.
No, no. Uh... it was me.
Im... Im drunk.
Im happy... but not myself.
Ive never really seen your eyes before.
There they are.
Just the two of them.
As Vice President Nixons home state of California
continues to count ballots,
both candidates bid their supporters a good night.
Vice presidential hopeful Senator Lyndon Johnson
had these words:
Im very proud of the manner
in which the Democratic campaign has been conducted
and which the people have reacted,
particularly in my state, the entire South,
and in many states...
Whats going on?
- I dont know... feel, uh, very confident...
Itll be all right in the morning.
Hell win California.
...the counting that...
Turn it off.
All Americans will be proud,
and I think we have much to be proud of.
I think this is one of Americas finest hours.
Sit down.
No.
You cant sit down in that dress.
You look so different when youre drunk.
Youre not going to call me Orson Welles again.
You loved that.
Who wouldnt like that?
What did I do wrong?
You have a big mouth.
Joan, I never said...
You have a big mouth.
I do.
Im not proud of it.
Did you like the play?
No.
The meaner you are, the more I like you.
I know.
Just like that?
I thought we could dance.
 ,  , cha-cha-cha.
Hildy, wake up.
Mm, its cold in here.
It is. You have to get dressed.
I cant find my glasses.
Thats too bad.
Tremendous.
Harry?
Yes?
I hope I didnt step on them.
Damn it.
Theres an optometrist on Lexington.
Great. Of course.
I dont want you to be worried.
It didnt mean anything, okay?
Youre not drinking for taste.
Dont be such babies.
Oh, God.
Its definitely not helping.
Im sorry. Does it offend you?
My shirt. And my mad money. Who did this?
I stole your blouse.
Im not joking. I had $ .   in here.
If I give you $ .  , will you keep your voice down?
Youre animals.
Im reporting it to building security.
Striking resemblance to Broderick Crawford.
Peggy Olsen, Highway Patrol.
Ive read three different newspaperswith three different results.
Im sure you know something I dont.
Well, I just spent the night literallyin a smoke-filled room at The Waldorf
with every Republican luminary save MacArthur and Jesus.
Theres been widespread fraud.
Daley gave Joe Kennedy every corpse in Cook County.
Otherwise, Nixon wins.
It shouldnt have been that close.
But it is. It always is.
Those jingles.
When they got Frank Sinatra,
I knew they would close the gap.
So what does he do now?
Walk away? Concede?
A recount in Illinois alonemeans    days without a president.
You dont want to win like that.
But you want to win.
He got   % of the vote, maybe more.
This way he lives to see another day.
So... what happens?
Neil from P&G said if Kennedy is willing to buy an election,
hes probably willing to play ball with us.
Ah, the optimism of the American corporation.
Its a football game to them.
Doesnt seem fair.
Fair?
Very good.
Where do you think youre going?
If I were you,
I would be very, very careful from now on
about the way you speak to me.
Can I help you?
Whats that?
Its yours.
It came to me by mistake.
Well, thanks.
Have you reconsidered my qualifications
for the head of account services?
Would it disappoint youif I told you it hadnt crossed my mind?
I feel strange having to talk to you in this way.
Spit it out, Campbell.
I know that your name is not Donald Draper.
Its Dick Whitman.
I dont know who Donald Draper is,
but according to my friend Russat the Department of Defense,
Dick Whitman died in Korea in     ,
and Donald Draper dropped off the map.
Although hes    years old,
in which case you look remarkably good.
Thats kind of elaborate.
Really?
I wish I knew more.
I bet a lot of people do.
Pete...
get out.
Youre making a fool of yourself.
You can deny it.
But I know its true.
I can see from your face.
You should leave.
Don...
you should think about how Bert Cooper will react
when he hears this information.
What information?
Youre not who you say you are,
and theres obviously a reason.
Come on.
I would like you to reconsider my qualifications.
You said everything except "or else."
Assuming this information is true, which it isnt,
it sounds to me like youre blackmailing me.
Im not.
Im hoping youll realize that this all can be forgotten.
Its not like youre a deserter, is it?
When you threaten someone in this manner,
you should be aware of the fact
that if your information is powerful enough
to make them do what you want...
what else can it make them do?
Its very simple.
And its not a threat. Its just a job.
Think about it.
Whitman.
Yes, Sergeant.
What is this?
This is it.
One? Im supposed to have   .
This is going to take a month, and it should take    hours.
Well, youre whining to the wrong guy, sir.
At ease.
Uh, this is for officers.
You can bunk next door.
I- Id introduce you to the men,
but youre looking at the complete company.
Where is everybody, sir?
They were gone when I got here.
Im an engineer.
Theyre in some action   miles over that mountain.
You want to go?
The answer is no.
The locals stopped showing up three days ago,
which, by the way, is not good.
Youre going to be doing all the digging.
Digging what?
Well, this unit... thats you...
will be establishing a field hospital,
but first were going to be diggingfighting positions on four sides.
What are you doing here? Are you poor?
I volunteered.
Youre kidding me.
Well, they got me with college.
But Im three years, six months nearly a civilian.
Im supposed to be building swimming pools, not latrines.
You any good with that r*fle?
I wouldnt want you to mistake me for Chinese.
As much practice as Ive had, yes.
What misconception traveled down the road
and made you want to be here?
A movie?
No. I just wanted to leave.
Ill bet youre reconsidering if this was a step up.


Miss Menken,
Mr. Draper is here to see you.
Please hold my calls.
Did you run over? Youre flushed.
Lets go away.
Really? Where?
Anywhere.
Warmer weather?
Sure.
How about Los Angeles?
Mexico? I have money.
I have money, but I have a store to run.
Don, are you well?
No, Im not.
Did something else happen to Roger?
No.
Something happened, and...
I want to go, and I want you to come with me,
and I dont want to come back.
What happened?
What does it matter? Isnt this what you want?
Of course. Ive thought about it.
My God, weve talked about it.
I just...
I just didnt think it would happen...
I mean, especially this way.
I just... dont want to be without you,
and I dont want to be here.
I cant just leave.
Maybe this weekend...
Rachel.
No. This isnt how I thought it would be.
What is the difference?
Well go somewhere else.
Well start over like Adam and Eve.
What, are you    years old?
My father...
Cant we be together here?
Theres nothing here.
What about your children?
Ill provide for them.
And live in Los Angeles?
My God, you havent thought this through.
I feel sick.
Youre wrong. I know exactly what I want.
You want your children to go on without a father?
You know how that felt.
Are you having an attack of conscience after all this?
No. Im watching you talk
because I feel I dont know you.
You know more about me than anyone.
You wont even tell me what happened.
Why are you doing this to me?
What kind of man are you?
Go away, drop everything, leave your life?
People do it every day.
- This was a dalliance, a cheap affair.- Rachel, dont.
You dont want to run away with me.
You just want to run away.
Youre a coward.
Please go now.
Get out.
Peggy, this is my office.
Does this door mean nothing to you?
Im sorry, Mr. Draper.
I didnt know you were coming back. I just...
I just...
Calm down.
Stop it.
I didnt mean to yell at you.
Got to be some semblance of privacy left here.
I had to get away from them all for a minute.
Drink this.
Sonny from the elevatorand some janitor... I dont know his name...
they got fired.
Thats why youre crying?
It was my fault.
I called security.
They werent even here last night.
Peggy, I need to be alone right now.
I know.
I know.
I dont understand.
I try to do my job.
I follow the rules,
and people hate me.
Innocent people get hurt, and...
and other people...
people who are not good...
get to walk around doing whatever they want.
Its not fair.
Finish it.
Ive thought about what you said.
Glad to hear it.
And then I thought about you
and what a deep lack of character you have.
I can understand your frustration, Don.
Believe me, Im not enjoying this any more than you are.
Im hiring Duck Phillips.
Don...
dont make me go to Cooper.
Im not making you do anything.
You havent thought this through.
- I have.- Really?
Youre just going to go up to the officeand tell Bert Cooper.
If I have to. I dont want to.
Let me ask you.
How do you think hell reactwhen you tell him this story of yours?
You expect him to promote you after the way youve behaved?
I think hell appreciate the loyalty.
You havent thought this through.
I dont know.
But Im pretty sure you wont be working here anymore.
What are you doing? Where are you going?
Im going to take care of this right now.
Is this like in the movies where I have a g*n
and you dont think Im going to sh**t you?
I will sh**t you.
I wont let you hold this over my head.
So youd rather blow yourself upthan make me head of accounts.
Why cant you give me what I want?
Ive earned this job. I deserve it.
Why? Because your parents are rich?
Because you went to prep school and have a $ .   haircut?
Youve been given everything.
Youve never worked for anything in your life.
For gosh sakes, dont you realizeyoure going to lose everything?
Im giving you a way out.
Would it be so bad?
Why is this so hard for you?
Youre really going to do this?
More bad news?
If you came here to drown your sorrows,
Im not really much of a drinker.
No. I just wanted to say...
Im pulling the trigger on Duck Phillips
as new head of account services.
Oh, good. Well done.
What?
I have to bring this up to you.
Only because I believe if I kept it from you
in the end it would be damaging to Sterling Cooper.
It has come to my attention, completely by accident,
that Donald Draper here is not who he says he is.
His real name is Dick Whitman,
but... Dick Whitman died in Korea ten years ago.
It stands to reason that he is a deserter at the very least
and who knows what else.
Mr. Campbell, who cares?
What?
Who cares?
Mr. Cooper, hes a fraud and a liar.
A criminal, even.
Even if this were true, who cares?
This country was built and run by men with worse stories
than whatever youve imagined here.
Im not imagining anything.
The Japanese have a saying:
A man is whatever room he is in,
and right now Donald Draper is in this room.
I assure you,
theres more profit in forgetting this.
Id put your energy into bringing in accounts.
Don,
fire him if you want.
But Id keep an eye on him.
One never knows how loyalty is born.
Shit!
Sir, what do we do?
Keep your head.
Dont sh**t at anything
unless it sh**t at you first.
What? What? What?
Shut up! Just stay down!
Shit!
Dont they know this is a hospital?
Were nuts if they know that.
Is it over?
I dont know.
- You think theyll be back?- I dont know.
We didnt sh**t back. That helps.
You pissed yourself.
What?
Did I?
Crap.
How are we doing, Lieutenant Draper?
On behalf of the President of the United States
and the citizens of the United States of America...
I present you with this Purple Heart medal.
The concussion was minor.
Youll feel like yourself in a week.
The colonel here has some good news for you.
Were releasing you to the Reserves for your last    days.
Youre going home.
Thats good news. Youre going to be okay.
Lieutenant Draper,
Private Whitman.
You were the last person who knew himin his chain of command.
Wed like you to take him home.
I think it would mean something.
Lieutenant Nelson, how you doing?
On behalf of the President of the United States
and the citizens of the United States of America...
Bunbury.
This is us, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Draper?
Just go.
I cant.
Okay.
There he is! I see him!
Who?
Dick. Hes on the train.
I see him.
No, hes right here.
But I saw him.
I saw him in the window over there.
Stop it. No more of that.
It must be hard for you.
Did you know him?
A little.
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Forget that boy in the box.
Look at you.
Let me buy a soldier a drink.
Dick!
With that, I want to say again
my deep thanks to all of you who are here
and those who have listened on television and radio,
and again my congratulations to Senator Kennedy
for his fine race in this campaign,
and to all of you...
I am sure...
I am sure his supporters
are just as enthusiastic as you are for me,
and I thank you for that.
