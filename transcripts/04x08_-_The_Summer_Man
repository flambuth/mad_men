They say as soon as you haveto cut down on your drinking
you have a drinking problem.
My mind is a jumble.
I cant organize my thoughts
and typing feels like work.
Ive never written more than 250 words,
not even in high school...
Five paragraphs, 50 words apiece.
God, I was lazy.
I shouldve finished high school.
Everything could have been different.
Are you okay, sir?
Summers coming.
I smelled it.
I kind of thought I smelledcorn, which is impossible.
There it was again.
Perfume.
Morning, miss blankenship.
How was your surgery?
It was a nightmare...
The ether and the blindness...
And then I got the goggles.
So everythings good?
Ill tell you... I was blind
- and now I see.- Well, good.
- If you need more time...- Im fine, Roger.
Im kidding around here.
My books at home.
Can you give me the numberfor a Bethany van Nuys?
May... maybe lift it up and drop it down.
Im stronger than you,but Im not that strong.
Stop stop....
- Hes right.- I feel like Margaret mead.
You know what, Harry? I think this is a show.
Okay, were gonna do it.
Harry, get out of the way.
What is going on out here?
I dont know.
I got blockaded on my wayback from the mens room.
Thank you, gentlemen....
- Everyone back to work.- It took my watch.
- What?- Ken was buying a Clark bar...
But it ate my change, and since
Dannys not here, we went to Peggy.
But it turns out Joeysgot the smallest hands.
No, I said I had done it before.
Why dont you put another dime in the machine
- and pull again?- Do you really think we didnt try that?
- This thing is a bandit.- Yeah.
Cut it out!
Dont make me come out here again.
Sorry, mom.
Pardon?
Okay. Hey, its over.
Im trying to get my watch.What am I supposed to do?
Call the complaint number. Havean adult solve this problem.
What is going on out here?
I was in the midst of anextremely important telephone call.
Joan was just handing out demerits....
Joey, in my office.
- Oh.- Go easy on him.
A private spanking... just like my dre dream.
When did we get a vending machine?
I know youre a freelancer andyou spend time in other offices,
but you should know thisbehavior is not tolerated here.
- Yes, maam.- I should let you know
theres a problem now between us.
Why are you always on my case?
Because you are particularly disrespectful.
No, Im not. Stansse.
Maybe hes better at his job.
Im glad youre amused.
Youre so arrogant.
Me? What do you do around here
besides walking around likeyoure trying to get r*ped?
Excuse me?
Im not some young girl off the bus.
I dont need some madam from a Shanghai
whorehouse to show me the ropes.
Oh, Im sorry. I didntknow you were in here.
Where the hell else wouldI be? This is my office.
And you all better stop cutting through here.
Its not a thoroughfare.
Take the extra steps. You could use them.
Youre right.
Go ahead. Im leaving anyway.
Im sorry.
Oh no.
Oh, miss blankenship, good to see you.
I mean, nice to see you.I mean, welcome back.
- Let me help you with those.- Finally, someone offers.
I told you I can see with the glasses.
- Im out of cigarettes.- Ive got your liquor.
I only have two hands.
- Im set.- And then youre not.
Take those back to the storeroom,
and while youre thereget me some cigarettes.
Your wife called earlier.
- Shes not my wife.- Mrs. Francis said to remind you
that you cant have the kids thisweekend. Its very complicated.
Its Bobbys birthday party Sunday.
Its genes birthday.
Did you want me to buy him or her a gift?
No.
What a pleasant surprise.
You dont mind that Im home early, do you?
You said you didnt want watch me pack.
You dont even want to say goodbye.
I dont.
Joanie, its basic training. Ill be back.
You said they use live amm*nit*on.
Come on. Come in here.
Greg, that doesnt make everything better.
- It makes it worse.- Its eight weeks.
Im gonna come back in uniform.
You know youll like that.
What am I gonna do? Who am I gonna talk to?
Well, youll talk to your friends at work.
Is this the way you wantto spend this time, crying?
- I cant.- Mmm, sure you can.
Just pretend were in some midtown hotel
and we both snuck away for the afternoon.
More and more every day about Vietnam.
I hope its not another Korea.
I sound like a little girl,
writing down what happened today.
Sunday is genes birthday party.
I know I cant go.
I keep thinking about him.
He was conceived in a moment of desperation
and born into a mess.
One,
climb mount Kilimanjaro...
Go anywhere in Africa, actually;
two, gain a modicum
of control over the way I feel.
I want to wake up
and I want to be that man.
Could you get that to el Jefe?
So mountain dew... everythingkind of fell apart there.
- They dont like the work.- Too bad.
Well, somebody showed acouple of bottlers the work
and they dont like witches brewing things.
They dont like the occult in general.
And you told them its theirhillbilly working a still?
I did, but the fact remains
that in the world of sodie pop
Pepsi is the tail andthe bottlers are the dog.
They just want us to change the drawing.
Except its damaged goods.
Theyre never gonna wantto see that board again.
- Start over.- I did it with Joey.
Do you want Stan to take over?
Youre spreading me awful thin.
Do you want me to tell Joan to figure it out?
"It"? You dont even know what "it" is.
Miss blankenship, get Joan in here.
She startles when you do that.
I had an uncle who was blind.
Shes not blind. Shesrecovering from cataract surgery.
He would come in the roomand he would say......
- What can I do for you?- A redo on mountain dew.
I want to make Joey fulltime for a couple of weeks.
Id have to double-checkon his availability,
but are you sure hes the right fit?
He did the first round. And were redoing it.
Its more complicated than that.
Well, this may not be the time or
the place to bring this up but...
- What now?- ...Ive been hearing complaints about him.
- Really?- Hes not a gentleman with the girls.
Okay. One juicy story?
Ill protect those concerned
but it involves an extremely blue joke.
- When?- It doesnt matter.
Fine, you can tell it to me later.
Of course,
but Im going to call in otherbooks. Theres too much to do.
- Are we done?- Sure.
Can you tell ray Charles tocome in here and clean this up?
And as soon as you get to Hollywood,
you find out that that myth is...
Well, it had some truth to it.
There is instant fame.
Whats this have to do with "Peyton place"?
Well, we went down to the set
and Ryan was doing thisscene against another rival...
I cant tell you who...and the guy was awful.
I start to hear him talkabout a young fresh face,
wholesome but a little mischievous.
Am I crazy?
I dont understand. You want to be an actor?
Does that sound like me?Thats you. You could do it.
I know the right people...maybe not the big screen,
but the small screen definitely.
Im kind of down to earth.
Youre so handsome. I showed them a picture.
Howd you get a picture?
I sent one of those polaroids from the
Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.
Mr. crane, I hate to interrupt you,
but I have Peggy Olson outhere looking for Mr. baird.
Well, thank you for thinking of me.
Youre too modest, you know that?
What were you doing in there?
Everyplace Ive workedtheres always some old fairy
who comes onto me, but thatwas the weirdest by far.
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.
- It happens a lot.- What did you do to Joan?
- I told her off.- Well, you shouldnt have.
- Shes important around here.- Let me
tell you something about the big ragu.
Were creative and shesan overblown secretary.
Fine, dont listen to me.
Theres a Joan in every company.
My mother was a Joan,
always telling everybody what to do.
She even wore a pen around her neck
so people would stare at her tits.
Shes not your mother, and sheand Lane basically run this place.
Okay, message received.
Ugh, is it time to go yet?
Glad you could make it.
Well, we were on our wayto the theater anyway.
Ralph Stuben, this is my wife Betty.
- Pleased to meet you.- I hope you dont mind.
The Congressman wantedme to do this immediately
and he didnt want meto do it over the phone.
She doesnt mind,
and shes very discreet.
Thats the curse of a political wife...
That and having to eat dinner with
a lot of people you dont know.
Bettys no stranger to public service.
- So what show did you see?- Why dont we get a drink at the bar?
Itll only be a minute.
Thank you.
So are you a Felix or an Oscar?
Like most men Id rather be an Oscar,
but Im probably a Felix....
Every date feels like a first date with you.
Is that good or bad?
Its just I know you mustbe seeing someone else.
And dont say no, becauseitll just hurt me more.
Look, Im here with you right now.
Were on a date
and I thought we weregetting to know each other.
It doesnt just accumulate.
It takes intense, prolonged contact.
Dont you want to be close with anyone?
I do.
I know were from different generations
but Im going to need more from you.
We are from different generations,
because I dont rememberwomen pushing this hard.
And Im not seeing anyone.
Im working...
All the time.
Well, I get excited when you call
and then I dont hear from you.
We dont have to get married for me
to show you off at the country club.
Don.
How are you?
Im fine, Henry.
Henry, Betty, this is miss van Nuys.
- Bethany.- Enjoy your dinner.
My goodness, what was that?
Well, that was actually my ex-wife
and her husband
and some slob whos about tohave the worst dinner of his life.
What? Her?
Well, first of all, my officialcapacity if anyone asks...
Im here to thank you for securing
the governors endorsementfor Congressman Lindsay.
Thats no small feat, Im sure.
Well, rocky only hateshim because hes handsome.
Well, not to worry.
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.
Any talk of the white house is fiction.
Huh. I guess he hasntseen the cover of "life."
Okay.
Hypothetically,
the Congressman is puttingtogether a team with his eye on 72
and well, it would be built...
If it were going to be built... around you.
And yes, he doesnt wantrocky to have you either.
Elizabeth, do you know what you want?
Honey, this part is almost over.
Im sorry. Youll have to excuse me.
One drink and she gets flushed.
Yeah, my wife has the other problem.
Are you okay in there, maam?- Yes, Im fine.
- You dropped your purse.- Ill take it.
What did you want me to do, put you in a cab?
That wouldnt be right.
I cant believe you made mesit there and look at them.
Nobody said you had to look at them.
You need a drink? Well, what are you, a wino?
You need a drink? That is notsomething youre allowed to say.
Oh, now you decide what I can and cant say?
I was in a marriage like that before.
Youre gonna run into him. Its a small town.
- I hate him.- Hates a strong word, Betty.
I hate n*zi.
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.
I dont like seeing her. I dont hate her.
- Youre a Saint.- Im an adult.
It was upsetting. Cant you let me have that?
Not when it ruins the whole evening.
This man is asking me totake Lindsay all the way.
That could happen. Dondraper doesnt have a say.
- Youre right. Who cares about him?- You do.
Hes taking up too much space in your life,
maybe in your heart.
Thats ridiculous.
Look,
maybe we rushed into this.
"We"?
I was six months pregnant when we met.
- Pull over.- Are you kidding me?
Let me out, Henry.
No, you know what? Let me out at the house,
because you dont want to live there anyway.
You can stay at a hotel orwherever you were when I met you...
In your mansion with your servants.
Shut up, Betty. Youre drunk.
What are you doing?
Making you comfortable.
Shes a sweet girl
and she wants me to know her,
but I already do.
People tell you who theyare, but we ignore it
because we want them tobe who we want them to be.
To be continued.
I bet she was thinkingof that line all night.
I looked up at the Barbizon
and I thought of all the women in there...
One in every room...
Touching themselves to sleep.
Waverly and 6th.
I like sleeping alone,
stretching out like a skydiver,
cool patches to roll onto.
I just appreciate it more.
No. No! Im talking now!
I dont care where you goand I dont care what you do!
So in order...
Would you let me talk? I want my key back,
I dont want to see your shorts on my floor
and I dont want you complaining......
...That I dont cook cause I dont cook!
You know what, David?Go sitting in the ocean!
Good morning.
Are you leaving already?
Were you going to say goodbye?
I thought you could use the sleep.
Im sorry, Henry.
Come over here.
I dont want to have todefend myself all the time.
All the time?
Henry, Im really sorry.
I know.
Get some sleep.
Carla took the kids to school.
Henry, he was the onlyman Id ever been with.
Ill call you later.
It tastes good, because it still
basically tastes like mountain dew.
And its very simple tomake. I call it jet fuel.
Rocket fuel, and I like thesimplicity of the idea...
- Young people, hillbillies.- Xerox crapped out again.
I think I k*ll it.
Ill run this specimen over to the lab.
Its delicious.
Ah. Youre a haircut, you know that?
You need three ingredients for a cocktail.
Vodka and mountain dew is an emergency.
Don wants our freelanceart director Joey baird
put on full time for the next three weeks.
None of my business I suppose.
I really think this vendingmachine is a troublemaker.
I think its been a great success.
Revenue is climbing.
I was gonna suggest weget a sandwich machine.
Wed probably get 40% of the work
force keeping busy through lunch.
Or wed end up with abunch of fat secretaries
who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime,
because theres always anothersandwich around the corner.
There have been a lot of complaints.
Did you tell them to call the number?
What do you think theyredoing in there... Lane and Joan?
Its an unholy alliance.
I know exactly what theyre doing in there.
Joans on the desk, boobs on the blotter.
Lanes behind her, probably has a bowler hat.
Am I wrong?
Hey, dont do that.
Im not doing anything. Joans doing it.
Mountain Dew-dah.
Give me three cocktails withat least three ingredients each.
Peggy Olson,
pioneering the science of wet blanketry.
You love her.
Holy Francis calling.
- This is Don.- Hello, Don. Henry Francis.
Sorry to bother you at work.
I assume its important.
It is but not dire.
Okay. What can I do for you?
I bought a boat and I...
Well, Id like to put it in the garage
and I dont have the clearancewith your things there.
No, of course.
I can probably have some movers take them,
put them in storage somewhere.I can take it off the rent.
No. No, thats okay.
I should probably come and get them myself.
Genes birthday partys on Sunday...
I know.
...So I think Saturdaywould be best, dont you?
I see.


The boats coming next week so...
Fine.
Ill come at noon.
Miss blankenship, can I get some coffee?s
I just lost 30 in the machine.
How is that possible?
Well, I wanted a pack of life savers
so I put in a nickel and it didnt work.
So I looked in my purseand all I had was a quarter,
so then I lost a quarter too.
Was the exact-change light on?
I started with the exact change.
Oh, Peggy, its a nickel.
Im not calling thatnumber. No one ever answers.
I cant believe you.
Fine, then give me some life savers.
- Who did that?- Did what?
That pornographic drawing.
Its a very brave person
that does something anonymously.
Its a very brave person who does that.
Its still illegal in many States you know.
I cant wait until next yearwhen all of you are in Vietnam.
You will be pining for the day
when someone was tryingto make your life easier.
And when youre over there,
youre in the jungle andtheyre sh**ting at you,
remember youre not dying forme, because I never liked you.
- Joan.- Dont worry. Im not going home.
Jesus. Scorched earth.
- Whats wrong with her?- I told you not to do that.
- Come on, Peggy.- Its a joke.
Shes still patting aroundfor the buzzer. Im sorry.
What do you want?
Joey taped it to Joans window.
- Really?- Yes, and its disrespectful to Joan
and its disrespectful to me.
Narrative, forced perspective...are you sure Joey did this?
Yes, I told him not to.
Well, I wouldnt tolerate that if I were you.
But you have no problem with it?
I didnt say that.
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.
Me?
I thought you would goout there and yell at him.
Yell at him, fire him. Look, believe me...
You do not want me involved in this.
People will think youre a tattletale.
Dr. Miller has arrived.
Send her in.
You want some respect? Go outthere and get it for yourself.
- Oh, Im sorry.- Have a seat.
Is everything all right?
Yes.
Joey, can I speak to you for a minute?
- You want one?- No.
Im sorry, okay?
Good. Now go apologize.
What? Then shell know I did it.
You did do it. I told you not to.
Come on. Its funny.
Really? Would you show it to Lane?
He would think its funny.
What if it were Don on his knees?
You have no sense of humor.
Youre fired.
All right, all right. Isee the nostrils are flared.
- Ill go apologize.- No, get your things.
- Are you serious?- I am.
Well see what Don has to say about that.
Don doesnt even know who you are.
Im sorry it didnt work out.
Hang on. Come on. This is crazy.
Its just a job, Joey.Youll get another one.
Well, I was wrong about you.
Whats going on?
Watch out, fellas. The funs over.
- What?- Thats all, folks.
- Are you serious?- A little bug bit me.
Well, Ill give you acall. Well have a drink.
Stan, throw vick chemical on the back burner.
Youre on mountain dew.
You know, these guys may be embarrassed
by having some professionaltell them what to do.
Hell take advice from another man.
Not if he knows more.
You know Im right about autoparts. I used to sell cars.
Yes, but we still have to do it.
God, this is boring.
I think Im hungry. Do you want to eat?
- You mean order in?- I dont know.
You seem kind of dressed up.
We could take Fillmoreparts with us if you want.
Youd like to have dinner with me?
Yes.
You asked me out thefirst time I came in here.
Why would it be different for me now?
It just felt like the timing is right.
So why dont we do that?
You could ask me out for dinner
at some future date insteadof... I dont know...
Tacking it onto a workdaylike an afterthought....
I could do that.
Saturday night far enough in the future?
Not normally, but youre in luck.
Good.
Okay then.
Ive got enough to go on here.
Okay.
Its Francine.
Come in.
Whoa. Im all bitten up.
This is my potato saladbowl, but this ones yours.
Well, thank you.
Henry was going to pick oneup on his way home from work,
but hes been so busy.
Oh, Betty, hes very ambitious.
Hes mad at me.
Why would that be so?
Oh God, if I can make itthrough this weekend...
Its awo-year-oldsbirthday party,
youll have help and no one cares.
Oh.
Is he coming?
I told him about it.
Now I can only hope hewont show up and ruin it.
Well, he wont.
We ran into him in the city...
On a date.
Bethany van Nuys... she was all of 15.
I misbehaved.
Henry didnt understand it for some reason.
Why do you let him bother you?
We see him walking outwith the kids some weekends.
- Carlton calls him "that sad bastard."- Thats an act.
Hes living the life, let me tell you.
He doesnt get to have this family and that.
Oh, Betty.
You have terrible luck with entertaining.
Just be careful.
Don has nothing to lose,
and you have everything.
I dont know if you heard, but I fired Joey.
I did. Good for you.
Excuse me?
Now everybody in the office will know
that you solved my problem and that you
must be really important, I guess.
Whats wrong with you? I defended you.
You defended yourself.
Fine.
That cartoon was disgusting.
I had already handled it
and if I had wanted to go further,
one dinner with Mr.Kreutzer from Sugarberry ham
and Joey wouldve beenoff it and out of my hair.
So? Its the same result.
You want to be a big sh*t.
Well, no matter howpowerful we get around here,
they can still just draw a cartoon.
So all youve done is proved to them
that Im a meaningless secretary
have a nice weekend. Good night, Peggy.
When a man walks into a room,
he brings his whole life with him.
He has a million reasons for being anywhere.
Just ask him.
If you listen, helltell you how he got there,
how he forgot where he was going
and then he woke up.
If you listen, hell tell you
about the time he thought he was an angel
or dreamt of being perfect.
And then hell smile with wisdom,
content that hed realized
the world isnt perfect.
Were flawed because we want so much more.
Were ruined
because we get these things
and wish for what we had.
- You smell nice.- So do you,
like chlorine.
Ive been swimming.
Does it feel like summer?
It clears my head.
- For the creative process?- For something.
Ive been a little out of sorts lately.
Its an effort to get in the water,
but when you do youre weightlessand you dont even sweat.
And in the end,
youre wrung out.
Ive been looking forward to this.
Its very hard to get a reservation here.
You shouldve called me. I know a guy.
Really?
Whos your guy?
My father.
A lot of people who supply restaurants
know a lot of the samepeople who know my father.
Like...?
Not my father, just his friends.
He owns a candy store
and there are certain responsibilities
that go along with that.
Interesting.
Whats he like?
Hes a handsome two-bit gangster like you.
Two glasses of chianti.
When Im out of sorts,I look at the calendar.
Theres usually somethingsignificant on the horizon.
I never noticed that.
Its my two-year-oldsbirthday,
but Im not going.
Why not?
Because Im not welcome there.
He thinks that mans his father.
Maybe thats okay.
All he knows of the world
is what you show him.
Oh, thats nice.
I know Ive sometimesbehaved to the contrary,
but I do admire your work.
Thats nice to hear.
So tell me a trade secret.
How do you get them to dowhat you want them to do?
Aesop has a fable about the wind and the sun.
The wind and the sun had this competition
to see if they could geta travelers coat off.
So the wind blows fiercely on him,
but the traveler just pulls his coat tighter.
But the sun shines down on him,
warmer and warmer,
and the traveler just
takes it off.
And the moral is?
Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win
where force fails.
You know, Aesop did thatin probably 10 lines.
Hes very economical.
So what youre saying is you want my coat.
72nd and Broadway.
Thank you.
Where do you live?
Only around the corner.
Really?
Yes.
But Im just going to take you to your door.
And why is that?
Because thats as far as I can go right now
and Im not ready to say good night.
Thats not what I expected.
- Hello, Francine.- Hello, Don.
Daddy!
Whats he doing here?
Its okay.
Here you go. Say hi to daddy.
Happy Birthday.
We have everything.
