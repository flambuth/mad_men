- Morning.- Don.
Can I havea moment?
I know youre decidingwhos gonna be on sunkist,
So I wantedto volunteer.
You want to go?
You knowthats a demotion.
Youre gonna bein one room withone account.
Thought about that,but rather than just beinga satellite office,
I was thinking I couldturn it into a little agency.
Los angeles is not whatyou see in the movies.
Its like detroitwith palm trees.
So its the frontier.
I dont even needrunning water.
Just let me set upthe homestead.
You think youre askingfor a promotion,
But if you fail there,youll be out of advertising
Because no onetakes it seriously.
All Im saying is thatI think itd be exciting
To build one deskinto a real business.
Thats not the wayI saw it.
Thats not the wayyou saw me.
And youre gonnachange that.
Ive always felt you learnmore from disappointmentthan you do from success.
Well, I supposeIm becominga very wise man.
- Hello, daddy.- How you doing, sweetie?
Oh? Wow.
- He did get my good side.
He made it forhis generous pop pop.
Why dont wetake you to lunch?
Come on, honey,Ive taken up enoughof dads time.
I wantedto say thank you,
But obviously thatwould be premature.
Its timeto take a breather.
Its prudent investing,its not personal.
No, it is personal.Im your daughter.
What do I have to doto get on the list of girlsyou give money to?
- Honey.- Dont be a brat.
Brooks wont say it,but youre taking foodout of our mouths.
Dont even botherto come to thanksgiving.
The tablewill be empty.
Stop it.Ill buy a turkey.
Sir, she doesntmean it.
Mr. Cosgrove is here.
Send him in.
Name a chocolate.
What, like hersheys?
Kenny, theres a reasonIm standing here.
Hersheys chocolatesent an rfp out tothe top 30 agencies
And all anyone seemsto care about is thatwere in the top 30.
Because hersheysisnt serious.
They dont advertise.They never have.
Mars billsat 10 million.
We think hersheysis asking for someoneto talk them into that.
- What did ted say?- He said his plate is fulland yours isnt.
But if you wantto take the lead on this,I think hell follow.
I love hersheys.
Get me in a room.
Ill get youwhat they sent me.
Hows the motor city?
I found a deli,but the airportslike calcutta.
Should be easieronce I get an apartmentand stop commuting.
Its a hellof an account.
Dont I know it.
Youre backin one piece.
Oh, one bigger piece.Im putting on weight.
- No one can see it.- Whats that?
- Its a racehorse.- Its for kevin.
Dont do that.Hes just gonna wanta real one.
Well see.They just gave bob one.
Well, you know whatthey say about detroit.
Its all fun and gamestill they sh**t youin the face.
Arent we goingto have dinner?
Eventually.
Im worried.Now they sent a letter.
Sally has tocall them.
Ill talk to herat thanksgiving.
I told you,we just have the boys.
Miss porters doesnt havethanksgiving vacation.
I read the letter.
The next stepis a subpoena.
Okay.
Hello.
You can have one.Then were having dinner.
Sounds like a plan.
Could you getbob benson for me?
-Bob bensonshere to see you.
Really?Send him in.
Were you circlingmy office?
- I dont understand.- Sit down.
It occurred to methat you havent hada performance review.
Yes, I did.Didnt mr. Cutlertell you--
I dont give a shit.
You have a hand onevery rung, dont you?
I dont think I knowwhat youre talking about.
What are you doingbuying presents for that kid?
Leading that woman on?Thats another mans kid.You know that?
I assure you, Im notinvolved with joan.
Were just buddies.
joans known forhaving a lot of buddies.
They go fishingtogether.
What does this have to dowith my performance?
Im asking the questions here.I see what youre up to.
Look, I know that youreconcerned with your career
And chevys counting on youbeing a family man,
But playing withmrs. Harris feelings
Is not the right wayto go about it.
- Youre right.- Damn it, bob,I better not be.
Im keepingan eye on you.
I appreciateyour candor.
Im looking forwardto having you outin detroit, bob.
Yes, sir.Thank you.
This is sally draperspeaking.
Its daddy.
What do you want?
I wanted to wish youa happy thanksgiving.
Okay.I have to go.
Also, Im callingbecause--
Well, I knowits unpleasant,
But you have to givea statement regardingthe burglar.
You need to makearrangements to be outof classes December 1st.
My calendar is full.
Honey, you have to.Its the law.
Well, I wouldnt wantto do anything immoral.
You know what?
Why dont you justtell them what I saw?
Hello?
Ive got it, moira.I have a personal plea.
Is this abouthershey again?
No, the folks fromsheraton are in the lobby.
Royal hawaiian.We cant find draper.
Again?
"band of gold" playing
You dont have to listen,but I have to say it.
Were all brothersin christ.
Thats his giftto us.
Were talking abouta fellowship far morepowerful than drink.
Can you keep it down?Im trying to drink.
Whats your occupation,young man?
Staying outof peoples business.
Youre not doinga very good job of it.
I didnt meanto engage you.
But you did.
cause somethingson your mind.
You need to talk.
I dont.
What if I told you
That jesus could offer younot only eternal life,
But freedom from painin this life?
Im doing just fine.
Nixons the president.
Everythings backwhere jesus wants it.
He doesnt workthat way.
cause hesmysterious.
He offer the same dealto kennedy?
Martin luther king?Vietnam, for christs sake?
Studies show jesushad a bad year.
Well, Im afraidtheres not one truebeliever in that list.
What the helldid you just say?
I told you beforeto get out and notcome back.
- Be on your way.- This is a house of sin.
You cant keep these girlsfrom the righteous path.
- They belong to the lord.- Youre wrong on that.
You love the biblecause you cant getyour dick hard.
Repentance isyour salvation.
Id tell you to goto hell, but I neverwant to see you again.
The onlyunpardonable sin
Is to believe godcannot forgive you.
Excuse me.Hey.
- I shouldnt be in here.- Guard: Youre right.
You punched a minister.You should be in rikers.
- Sleep it off.
Absolutely not.
Youll have candyat the theater.
- Oh, hello, peggy.- Hello.
Good night.
Come on, boys.Lets go.
Clara, Im going to givemy keys to the subletter.

Lets see.
"need to inform you,mother lost at--"
Oh, my goodness.She fell off a ship!

Get bud on the phone.
I assume this has somethingto do with last night.
Yes.
Megan, I--
Come over here.
Where were you?
I spent the nightin jail.
Why are youlaughing?
because I realized
Its gottenout of control.
Ive gottenout of control.
Sorry you had tofind out that way.
But I realizedsomething else, too.
I dont wantto be here anymore.
- Itll get easier.- No.
I want to moveto california.
What?
I dont want you togive up your career.
I dont want youto think that.
I just cant bein new york anymore.
I want to move to l.A.
I dont--
I dont knowwhat to say.
There have been all theseopportunities in hollywood,
But I never evenconsidered it
Because I thought itwould make you go crazy.
But-- I mean,wouldnt it?
What would you doout there?
Sunkist wants usto have someone local.
It could be likehaving my own shop.
A small team, a desk,
Windows, some sunlight,
The ocean.
Youd throweverything away here?
No.
Its an opportunity
To build one desk
Into an agency.
Wed be homesteaders.
Really, don?

This was to bea junior position.
Look, Im the search party
And I decided we werethinking too small.
Well, I thinkwe can spare you.
I apologizefor sheraton, ted.
That wont happen again.
Thats myrecommendation.
Of course I welcomea vote on the matter.
How is it every decisionmade in this place
Is subject to 10 opinionsunless its him?
What if we need him here?
Its california,not the moon.
There are telephonesand airplanes.
Youre already doingthe heavy lifting.
This is goodfor you, ted.
Honestly, I havebigger problems than this.
Dawn, could you bring mea carton of cigarettes?
You didntthink ahead.
You let her go and yetyou still need something.

You probably dictatedthe memo right to her
And had no ideashed be affected.
Hold on a second.
I was gonnatalk to you.

I can probably get youout there eventually.
To work for you?No, Id rather stay here.

Im gonna have thatsandwich on my desk.
I need to get to itbefore you do.
Are you kidding me?They got married?
What the hell was heeven doing there?

For one thing,margaret and the son-in-laware bleeding him dry.
Trust me, he loves it.
Well, hes forlorn.

But ralph stoppeddrinking and you knowlittle ralphies spastic.
I think bothare too much for him.
Mr. Draper.
Mr. Chaoughs hereto see you.

You should come to hersheyssince Im going to california.
Thats notwhy Im here.
Do you want something?
No, thank you.
I dont knowhow to say this,
But I wantto go to california.
Really?We cant both go.

You put all thatenergy and optimismback into the business
And let mego out there.
Im the one who needsto start over.

No, with my family.
I dont understand.
Yes, you do.
Its myonly chance, don.
Ive got kids.
I cant throw this away.I cant--
I cant go onlike this.
Im sorry, ted.I wish I could help you.
I dont know whatI brought out in you,
But I knowtheres a good manin there.
I need youto help me
Put 3,000 milesbetween me and her
Or my life is over.
I didnt makemy decision lightly.
I need it, too.
And, frankly,theyre writingmy wife off her show.
Its too late, ted.
It will go away.
Will you have a drinkbefore the meeting?
My father was--you cant stop coldlike that.
Every agencyyoure going to meet withfeels qualified
To advertisethe hershey bar
Because the product itself
Is one of the most successfulbillboards of all time.


And its relationshipwith america
Is sooverwhelmingly positive
That everyone in this roomhas their own story to tell.
It could be rationsin the heat of battle
Or in the movie theateron a first date.
But most of themare from childhood.
Mine was my father
Taking me to the drugstoreafter Id mowed the lawn
And telling me I couldhave anything I wanted.
Anything at all.And there was a lot.
But I pickeda hershey bar.
The wrapper looked likewhat was inside.
And as I ripped it open,
My father tousled my hairand forever
His loveand the chocolate
Were tied together.
Thats the storywere going to tell.
Hersheys is the currencyof affection.
Its the childhoodsymbol of love.
Well, werent youa lucky little boy?
Our company excelsin television
And well tell youexactly when and whereto tell those stories.
Sweet tales of childhood.
I supposewed start with yours.
Roger:You cant just have that.You got to pay us first.
And thatswhats so exciting.
Im sorry,I have to say this
cause I dont knowif Ill ever see you again.
What?
I was an orphan.
I grew upin pennsylvania...
In a whorehouse.
I read about milton hersheyand his school
In "coronet" magazineor some other crap
The girls leftby the toilet.
And I readthat some orphans
Had a differentlife there.
I could picture it.
I dreamt of it--
Of being wanted.
Because the womanwho was forced to raise me
Would look at meevery day
Like she hopedI would disappear.
Closest I gotto feeling wanted
Was from a girl
Who made me go throughher johns pockets
While they screwed.
If I collectedmore than a dollar,shed buy me a hershey bar.
And I would eat it alone
In my room
With great ceremony...
feeling like a normal kid.
It said "sweet"on the package.
It was the onlysweet thing in my life.
Do you wantto advertise that?
If I had my way,you would never advertise.
You shouldnt havesomeone like me
Telling that boywhat a hershey bar is.
He already knows.
Dons being modest.
But its just this kindof theater
That makes our workso different.
Well, thatsquite a story.
It was a pleasuremeeting you.
Stop you from going to someof these other meetings.
Ted...?
- It was a pleasure.- Yes.
Youre goingto california.
Are you sure?
I want you to.
Thank you.
Dawn, get my things.
You know, you shitthe bed in there.
- I dont care.- Was any of that true?
Yes.I have to go home.
Happy thanksgiving,sweetheart.
You, too,mr. Draper.
So your mother likely wentmissing over the promenade.
Its the only way she wouldnthave hit a deck below.
No, where wasthe boat?
Oh, somewhere offthe coast of martinique.
Did they checkthe beaches?
Well, first of all,there are a lot of sharks.
As I said, theres noimpetus for either governmentto investigate
And the ss sunset princessin contacting you
Has fulfilledits obligation.
Its 1968.
Surely youre nottelling me
Theres still someinternational oceanic limbo
I have a private investigatorprepared to board the ship
And locate your mothershusband-- well, nurse--
Manolo col?n,alias marcus constantine.
We also have wheelswe can grease in panama.
No stone unturned,no expense spared.
Ahem, lets say we wantthe very best of everything.
What are the expenses?
To bring your mothersk*ll to justice?
- Ballpark.- It may take time.
Now that manolos awareof her limited financialresources, he may bolt.
Alvin, I have anothercall coming in.
Can we continuethis later?
When you think about it,
It wont bring her back.
Shes in the water
With father.
She loved the sea.
I didnt wantto disturb you.
What happened?
I dont even knowhow to say this.
Did you tell nan?
Did you confess?I told you to wait.
No, thats--
Im goingto california.
You can stay hereand have your life
And your careerand let this be the past.
I cant believedon did this.
I knew he wasnt going.He knows its siberia.
- I can undo this.- No, peggy.
He gave uphis spot for me.
Don?
I wanted this so much,but I have a family.
The world out there...
I have tohold onto them
Or Ill get lostin the chaos.
Oh.
You have tolisten to me.
I love youthat deeply.
I cantbe around you.
And I cant ruinall those lives.
Get out.Just get out.
Someday youll be gladI made this decision.
Well, arent you luckyto have decisions?
Dawn just called.She said theresa partners meeting
Tomorrow aboutcalifornia.
Attendance is mandatory.9:00.
You have a meetingon thanksgiving.
They must reallywant us out of here fast.
Honey.
You have tosit down.
Why?
Because somethingcame up.
And its notjust sally, its--
Its what?
Im sorry, but we cantgo to california right now.
No, don, thats--
Thats not possible
Because I already told mel
And jeff huntersgot me a bunch ofmeetings out there
- And the trainis leaving the station.- The agency decided that--
the agency.I quit my job.
Megan.
You know what?
I dont even knowwhy were fightingfor this anymore.
I dont know what it is.
We dont have any kids.
You wato be alonewith your liquor
And your ex-wifeand your screwed-up kids.
Dont say that.
I love them to death.
I used to feelpity for them,
But now I realizewere all in the same boat.
I know youre upset.
But Im gonna be outthere all the timewith you.
Well be bicoastal.
Megan, I love you.
I cant do this.
I cant be hereright now.
Theyll deliverthe lowboy
And the china closetnext Friday.

And I already look likethe beverly hillbillies
I dont want yourmothers things, peter.
Well, buds notgetting everything.
And Im not movingeverything to californiawith me.
Its fine.Ill manage.
When are you leavingfor your parents?
When tammyfinishes her nap.
When are you leavingfor los angeles?
Soon as I can.
Id invite you,but I think its bestyoure alone right now.
- Dont be cruel.- No.
Its going to take youa moment to realizewhere you are.
Youre free.
Free of her.Youre free of them.
Youre freeof everything.
Its not the wayI wanted it.
Now you know that.
Can I go inand say goodbye?I wont wake her.
I was told 9:00.
Right on time.Impressive.
Don, we need to havea serious conversation.
Where would youlike to do it?
Is this aboutthe hershey meetingyesterday?
BecauseI can explain.
Well, unfortunately,that meeting
And most of yourquestionable behavioris beyond explanation.
Should I sit down?
Yes.
Im not goingto defend myself.
Ive tolerated plentyfrom every one of you.
Don, theres no needfor defense.
This isnt a trial.
The verdicthas been reached.
So what timedid this meeting start?
We think its bestfor you and the firm
If you take sometime off and regroup.
- How much time?- A few months.
But the holidays are coming.Thatll take up most of it.
Did you tell ted?
cause he cant goto california if theresno one here to run new york.
Ted feels confident he canoversee peggy from l.A.
He knowsits temporary.
I want a return date.
We cantgive you that.
You all agreewith this?
Try and see itfrom our side.
- Good morning.- Hello, don.
Youre early.
Sorry about that,old chum.
This is lou averyfrom dancer fitzgerald.

Going down?
"moon river" playing
Whats that?
We couldntsend it back.

Happy holidays.
Whats hedoing here?
Im inviting youinto kevins life,
Not mine.
Okay.
Hi, bob.
Mom, rogers here.

Hello, little man.
- You readyfor some turkey?- Yes.
Here, let meget it for you.
I thought you left.
No, Ive gottoo much to do.
And you thoughtyoud do it in here?
Its whereeverything is.
See you Monday.
Did they name it "hershey"because of the chocolate
Or is the chocolatenamed after the city?
There was a mannamed hershey.
He made enough chocolateto build a town.
Why are we stopping?
This is a badneighborhood.
Come on.
This is where I grew up.
"both sides now" playing
rows and flowsof angel hair
and ice cream castlesin the air
and feather canyonseverywhere
Ive lookedat clouds that way
but now they onlyblock the sun
they rain and snowon everyone
so many thingsI would have done
but cloudsgot in my way
Ive looked at cloudsfrom both sides now
from up and downand still somehow
its cloud illusionsI recall
I really dontknow clouds
at all
moons and junesand ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing wayyou feel
when every fairy talecomes real
Ive looked at lovethat way
but now its justanother show
you leave em laughingwhen you go...
