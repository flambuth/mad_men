"Greyhound.The cure for the common bus."
"La-Z-Boy. The cure for the common chair."
"Budweiser.The cure for the common beer."
"Manufacturers Hanover Bank.
"The cure for the common bank."
How about, "Alka-Seltzer.The cure for the common cold"?
"The cure for the common cold"is the idiom Im playing off.
Its an idiom. Did you know that?
So other than your summer internshipat Needham,
do you have any actualadvertising experience?
"The cure for the common chair,"thats Rogers favorite.
Roger Sterling.
Hes the guy I shook hands withwhen I came in.
What did Roger think of this ad?
What, are you kidding me?Everybody loves that.
Its the opposite of what you expect.Thats what Im interested in.
Why is it in your book?
Ive got a bunch of them in there.Marlboro Man, Maidenform.
I like to put in work that I admire.
Dont you ever tear thingsout of magazines?
Yes, but I dont put them in my book.
Well, you know what they say,
"Aspirations as good as perspiration."
Thats not how it goes.
Look, Im a 24-year-old kid.
I want to be in the ad game.
I know Ive got a lot to learn,but Im a hard worker.
Id sweep up the floors around here.
I dont know if Roger told you that.He did talk to you, didnt he?
He did.
It was really a pleasure to meet you, Danny.
-I wish you the best of luck.-Best of luck in what?
-What do you mean?-You trailed off.
Well let you know.
Do you know a good placeto eat around here?
Tell my secretary youre hungryand see what she suggests.
I dont work for you.
Are we on Candid Camera?
I dont want to jump on his graveor anything,
but theres no way hes 24. Im 25.
Whats his connection to Roger?
Besides being delusional?
Hes Jane Siegels cousin.
Its a relief to see someoneworse than me and really know it.
Dont get used to it.
Well, you know, I look at Glo-Coatand see how far everythings come.
You know, my work.
Glo-Coat.
You finish something,you find out everyone loves it
right around the time thatit feels like someone else did it.
Is that your speech for the CLIOs?
They dont have speeches.
Were going to win.
Just because I got nominated
doesnt mean theyre going to give mean award.
-Arent you excited?-I try not to think about it.
Then you must be excited.
Well, itd be good for the agency.
Grey doubled their value in five yearsand it was all based on awards.
You got anything on Vicks?
-Actually, its Vick Chemical.-Answer the question.
Were very behind.
Your new art directorhas been waiting for synchronicity,
which involves me coming upwith a bunch of ideas,
chasing him down and having himdraw all of them and lose them.
Hes your new art director, too,and you have a deadline.
And dont think you can spend Mondayhiding behind corners
and trying not to make eye contact.I will find you.
Im not the problem.
You are, because Stan is talentedand more experienced.
You need to learn how to work with him,not the other way around.
Well, good luck this afternoon.
Youre not supposed to say that.
Well, break a leg.
Charlie Chaplin was very lonely.
That Tramp, too much of a sad sack.
Laurel and Hardy, they were better,except Hardy was so mean to Laurel.
I hated that.
Why am I talking about silent movies?
I suppose as part of the chapteron your childhood?
That part of my bookis getting bigger and bigger.
Why is that?
Who is it?
I thought I should come inand tell you this in person.
That kid, a very, very cute prank.
Caroline, to be continued.
Thats a good idea.
Ive been to the CLIOs before.Were gonna want to show up prepared.
His book,
it was filled with old ads.
Plagiarism, thats resourceful.
He had five originals,they were all the same thing.
I told him to be himself.That was pretty mean, I guess.
-So when does he start?-The first of never.
Well, you havent been married for a while,
so youve probablyforgotten how these transactions work.
If I dont hire Janes cousin,
its probably going to cost mea personal gift expenditure
of between $500 and $1,000.
-When are we leaving?-Right after Life Cereal.
To new business.
And victory at the Waldorf.
I mean it. You deserve it.
So, I can show you whats popular,whats unique,
and the only thing I askis that you call me Don.
Well, Don, I cant sayI know my furs that well.
I know my mother had a Chinchilla,
I was always on the vergeof a romantic relationship with it.
-Is this for your mother?-I bet you never hear that.
I dont. Would you liketo give me a price range?
Thats an interesting question.I have a unique problem.
I need to spend a lot,but be careful not to spend too much.
Not a unique problem.And I dont want to be forward,
but can I assume this issome kind of an apology?
No, no, no, I know exactlyhow much that costs.
This is, "Im getting to know you,but I dont want to scare you."
I know what were gonna do.
So now its "we"?
Its always the right sizeand nothing says mink like mink.
Its a nice way to ease into things,
and you can always come backfor the rest of it.
How about we split the differenceso they wear them to their waist?
Its the most popular this year.
Thats a dumb question.Who does your work?
-I do.-Really?
Yeah. Its an interest of mineand they let me do it.
Look at that. Can I give you a call?
First of all, you need 20 of those.And second of all, no.
I just want you to call that numberso I can give you
some very specific delivery instructions.
Of course, Mr. Sterling.
So what do I owe you?
I saw you leave the officewith something under your arm.
You dont know what it is.
The guy in the elevatorthought it was a hydrogen b*mb.
Its a beautiful box.
Skip the radio play. Open it.
Roger, you shouldnt have.
-You like it?-I dont know what to say.
Try it on.
But first, take off the dress.
One gift at a time.
What is this, an owners manual?
Its Noahs Ark.
Its out of line is what it is.
So?
I love it. its perfect.
And I think its a bit much.
If you dont kiss me after that,Im gonna believe you.
When I Wear it, Ill think of everythingthat happened the night I got it.
Caroline! Get in here.I think I finally have a work story.
Joan! Whats keeping them?
Life.
When do you have to leave for the CLIOs?
I was late for the Emmys last year.
Red Skelton gave my seat away.
Ill surmise,due to the usual nature of your stories,
that thats someone of note.
The good news is our friendsat the cereal company
have been grounded in Philly due to wind.
Whats good about that?
And the bad news is
we only have an hourbefore were due at the CLIOs.
Sorry, kids.Game called on account of wind.
If its all about a send-off, Ill have a 7&7.
You have legs. Don?
Make it simple, but significant.
Its Friday.
For all we know, theyre going toturn around and go home
and well have to reschedule.
Is Joan going with you?
Yes. We only had four tickets.
Therell be a lot ofother peoples clients there.
-Thank you, Joan.-Peggy, anything?
I have work to do.
”We represent the majorityof the people in Alabama
"who hate niggerism, Catholicism,
”Judaism and all the ismsin the whole world.”
So said Robert Creelof the Alabama Ku Klux Klan.
Somebody got it to Goldwater.
Apparently he pissed bl*od.
”...he needs our help. "
This again? Really?
Clara asked.
Clara asked to see your reel?
I just wanted to see that Klan one.He said it never aired.
Which makes it less impressive, Clara.Girls, do you mind?
Well, all the girls are gone.What do you want?
Are you going to use the KKKto sell cough drops?
Its better than waiting on you
to bring me somethingthatll get my juices flowing.
Should I get Megan back in here?Maybe shes not repressed.
Whys it so hard for you to acceptthat mans natural state is nude?
Because Im civilized.
Because youre brainwashedby society into thinking its dirty.
You take away all this crapand youd see its not.
Its natural and its beautiful.
Have you been yelled at by Don yet?
-Im not scared of him.-So thats a "No."
He said Monday,and Im not working this weekend.
Okay, okay. Jesus. Are you on the rag?
Itll get done. Lets go.
Well, Id say youre luckythe Glo-Coat brass isnt here.
The minute you win they know the ads arty,and then youre out of business.
Turns out theres almost 50 awards.
Lets say 10 minutes apiece, thats...Holy crap.
Roger, you remember Ned Elliot from K&E.
Of course. What are you in for?
New England Merchants Bank.Best local under $2,000.
Stop bragging, will you?
Good luck, Don.
Well, well, if it isntPebbles and Bamm-Bamm.
Leave any drinks for the rest of us?
Don Draper, Roger Sterling,this is Major-General Frank Alvin.
Roger, have you had the pleasureof meeting Ted Chaough?
Is that how you say it? C-H-A-O-U-G-H?
Hey, writers, how many extra vowels is that?
Lets head due south, General.
Boy, I hope this doesnt drag onlike last year.
Oh, wait. You werent here.
General Rufus T. Bullshit.
Ive met that guy before.
-In the w*r?-No, in a commercial for Bay Rum.
Chao-guh-guh hired an actorto impress someone.
Last time I saw the General,he had a parrot on his shoulder.
That was not a business proposition.
You catch more flies with honey.
Great, actual flies.
Phillip, how are you?
-You remember Joan Harris.-Nice to see you.
Mr. Cosgrove, nice to see you again.
Im surprised he would bring you over here.
You know, we miss Birds Eyemore than we miss Kenny.
Well, thats why I wanted to say hello.
-I hear the old teams getting back together.-What team?
Phil, thats not a sure thing.
Well, Ill say this about Geyer,they dont have Don.
Take your seats, please.
Well, we should sit down. Good luck.
Judas priest. Are we merging with Geyer?
Talk to Lane.
Welcome to the Sixth AnnualAmerican Television Commercials Awards.
We re here to honor creative excellencein advertising and design...
I just ran into Ken Cosgrove.
Dont talk to me right now.
And I do mean everything.
I dont know if it was that funnybut thank you.
I have to tell youI am very impressed you got this gig.
Yes. Well, thank you for making it easier.
Wally, its me.
You know, when I was coming up at Y&R,you were very inspiring.
Raymond Rubicam said you were a genius.
Its great to see you.
I mean, actually alive and everything.
Get your hands off me.
Whats with the French service?
God! I miss working with that guy.
I feel like Ive already won.
Well, im afraid thatll be the limitto the public speaking portion of our show.
And, gentlemen, lets pace ourselves.
In the first category, that of apparel,the nominees are...
Thats five.
If you really worked onthe Johnson campaign, why are you here?
Because nobody at DDBeven keeps track of who does what,
except the daisy ad. Big deal.
The Klan is probablythe best thing Ill be near my entire life.
Well, let me tell you,I had a lot to do with Glo-Coat. A lot.
The idea, especially.
The kid?
Don put the whole cowboy thing on it.I dont know if it was that revolutionary.
It was jarring, but more cute than I like.
I know Im not supposed to go,but when the nomination came in,
Don let everybody pat him on the back.
He didnt even look at me and I was...I was right there.
And I was clapping and he thoughtI was clapping for him.
Who claps for themselves?
Okay, Im gonna riff for a few minutes
and just sort of speechatizethe whole Vicks experience.
Should I come back when youre through?
No, toots, grab a pencil.
Someones gonna want to get it downbefore it heads into the Stratosphere.
Why dont you write down my ideas?
Look, I read your brochure.
I have no interestin the Temperance Movement.
-Congratulations.-Thank you.
This is Byrrh on the rocks.
Be the first on your blockto serve Byrrh on the rocks.
And now for best Cleansers,waxes and polishes.

-Congratulations, Don.-Thank you.
-Next up, competing in the category of..-Let me see it.
-Congratulations.-Thank you.
-Whats going on, dear?-Well, I ran over
because the people from Life Cerealrented a car
and now theyre waiting at the office.
-Right now?-Well reschedule.
Maybe I can convince themto stay for the week.
No, no. They want to see our presentation.
What do you saywe put a cherry on this thing?
-Aye aye, sir.-Really?
So the Schusters move intowhat used to be the Harrington house.
Meanwhile, Betty gets extremely jealous
when she sees Allison dancingwith Rodney at the after-party.
But then Michael askedBetty to dance with him
and also dances with Claire
and that is all I can tell you aboutthe next few weeks of Peyton Place.
-How the heck do you know all this?-They send me the scripts.
I need to see them. its my job.
I cant believe Conniegoes through with their wedding.
It is a surprise. I agree.
What more do I need to say?
-its heavy.-Don, you remember...
Jim and Dennis, glad you could make it.
I cant thank you enough for waiting.
Dont think about it. Weve been unwindingas Mr. Crane ruins Peyton Place for us.
Perfect. Lets get to it.
-Roger, thank you.-Ill be on my way, but first, victory lap!
Come on, Don, Pete, Crane, Jimmy Olsen!
Wrap it up quickly, gents.We have an after-party to attend.
Thank you, Roger.
-Is everyone set?-Thats one word for it.
Joey, you didnt start without me, did you?
No, Don. I would not do that.
Okay, everybody ready?
So...
Life Cereal, delicious, crispyand its got a big name, you know.
And I know you wantto associate it with health,
but thats not fun. Joey?
You know what? Ive got it.
Look, there are sweeter cereals than this,
but I kept thinking about,you know, nostalgia.
How you remember something in the pastand it feels good, but its a little bit painful,
like when you were a kid.
-Thats the truth.-And "Life,"
thats a scary word to anyone at any age.
So how do we make it fun?
"Eat life by the bowlful."
Little kid, big bowl, big spoon.
Kids see the giant bowlof cereal and they smile
because, you know,theyd eat a box of it if they could.
And moms see it and they get this twinge
of how little their kid still is,even though they have to deal with life.
Get those two together in a marketand I think were going to sell some cereal.
Thats all I have.
I think if youd invite usinto the rest of your company,
we could build a Saturday morning TV show
around the whole Quaker Oats family.
In fact, it could be calledThe Quaker Oats Family.
I like the bowlful,
but I think its kind of smartfor regular folks, you Know?
The irony, I guess.
Children will get the picture.Moms will get the irony.
Yeah, but when I go back to Chicago,all theyre gonna wanna hear is a slogan,
and I dont think this is gonna cut it.
Well, why dont we let Don work that over?
We can either talk on Mondayif youre staying the weekend
or we can come see you in Chicago.
Ive got it. Ive got it, Pete.
How about
"Life is just a bowl of Life Cereal."
"Life is sweet."
"Enjoy the rest of your Life Cereal."
Don, theyre not expectingyou to do this right now.
Give me a second.
"Life. The reason to getout of bed in the morning."
"Life. The cure for the common breakfast."
"Life. Its sweetness never ends."
-"Life. Eat it by the bowlful."-There you go.
"The cure for the common breakfast."
-Love it.-Its got the health angle.
Life makes you feel better.Its got protein. Very nice.
That dog will hunt.
Wonderful.Well get that put together for you.
-Should we discuss media?-I can keep going.
I think weve got a home run.
We dont need to take upany more of your time.
I Know you have some celebrating to do.
I dont know what to say.
This is the most funIve ever had in New York.
Anytime, fellows.
Very good then.
Roger, Im done! Lets go!
Can I speak with you a moment?
-Got anything on Vicks yet?-I really need to talk to you.
-You still have nothing?-The tagline...
Do you think Im jokingwhen I give you a deadline?
-You said Monday.-Ida, book a nice room with a lock on it
for Misters Olson and Rizzo. Bill it to Vicks.
-Dont come out until you have something.-Are you kidding?
Pete, well walk them out.
Do you want to pick a place or should I?
He wasnt serious.Its the weekend. Well work in the office.
Do you want me to go chase him downto see if hes serious or not?
Go get Stanley.
-I need to speak with you.-Not now.
-Lane, may I?-Come in.
Im only going to ask once.Are we merging with Geyer?
-No.-Really?
Well, I ran into Ken Cosgroveand Clarence Birdseye at the CLIOs.
It came to methat Mr. Cosgrove was unhappy
and that he and his choice clientswould be a welcome addition to the firm.
Over my dead body.
I apologize.It was wrong of me not to consult you.
-I wasnt sure...-Wasnt sure about what?
Whether to go behind my back?
Im a partner, damn it.I have the same status here as you.
Youve never liked me.
You picked him over me to begin with
and now you expect meto work with him again?
Approval denied.
Roger Sterling is a child,
and frankly we cant have youpulling the cart all by yourself.
Ken is proven.
Hes hungry, and he has accounts.
Birds Eye, a beverage called Mountain Dew
and Fillmore Auto Parts,which has entered the national arena.
He would more than pay for himself.
Does that put you at ease?
What would put me at ease
is you and Madame Defargenot plotting behind my back.


Still, I expect pragmatism from you.
We share that.
Mr. Cosgrove and Iare having lunch on Monday.
If your tantrum has subsided,youre welcome to join us.
-Im going home.-And on a personal note,
Id like to add that Im quite fond of you.
It pains me to hear you say otherwise.
Get that thing in here.
General.
Youre not flying tonight, are you?
No, its been years.
I bet. Name some aircraft for me.
-No.-No, wait. Who do you report to?
-The president.-Of what, William Morris?
You know, one of these decorationsis for shutting up loudmouths.
Its a pleasure to meet you, General.Enjoy your evening.
-Don, congratulations.-Thank you.
You, too. Were the top of the heap.
-The heap of what?-I know they give out 50 a year,
but Ive got to say,it doesnt get any sweeter than this.
Roger, buy Ned a drink.
There you are.
Your mom called. Shes looking for us.
It was very nice meeting you.
-What are you doing?-Rescuing you.
From what? A business opportunity?
Did you see the part where I won?
No, but I heard about it.
Theyre gonna put your pictureon a dartboard at Grey.
Whats their problem?
Grey won. Everybody won.
Thats not true.
And just think how youd feelright now if you lost.
About the same, I suppose.
It doesnt make the work any better.
Thats very healthy.
Award or no award, youre still Don Draper.
Whatever that means.
Youre incredible.
You smell good.
Is that right?
What do you say we get out of hereand really celebrate?
I think youre confusing a lot of thingsat once right now.
Im very happy for you.
Are you calling to give him an update?
Im calling him about somethingcompletely unrelated to you.
I Know you have a special relationship.
-What does that mean?-What?
Not that. Jesus! Of course not that.
Do you think hed be caught dead with you?Theres wallpaper more exciting.
But I know youre his favorite.
I bet he takes you hunting
and lets you carrythe carcasses in your mouth.
Are you gonna work or just stare at pictures
of women who cant stare back?
You wouldnt understand,but this inspires me,
opens my mind with freedom.
So why arent you a nudist?
You talk about it all the time.
Well, in a liberated environment, I would be.
In the presence of the Pope or say, you,
its difficult.
You dont know anything about me.
I know youre ashamed of your body,or you should be, at least.
What are you doing?
Youre lazy. And you have no ideas.
-Really?-Yeah. Lets go.
Youre a fruitcake, you know that?
And youre chicken shit.
I can work like this. Lets get liberated.
Fantastic.
What are you waiting for?
Just...
Lets talk cough drops. What you got?
Im thinking.
About what?
Dont flatter yourself. its involuntary.
Maybe it was left over from the magazine.
Terrific.
Now I dont thinkits that hard to convince people
that cough drops are medicine,especially when they taste like it, right?
So youre really gonna leave me alonewith all these naked gold women?
Excuse me. I hate to interrupt.
Youre not interrupting.
That man over there,I saw you talking before.
-Is that Don Draper?-Yes it is.
-Is he attached?-To that glass? Absolutely.
No.
Hes pretty proud of himself.
Well, its a big day for him.
Its a big day for all of us.
Especially you, okay?
Well, they dont seemto give awards for what I do.
And what is that?
Find guys like him.
Youve crossed the borderfrom lubricated to morose.
Good night.
Mr. Sterling.
-Do I know you?-its Don.
Don Draper. Hellers Luxury Furs.
The fur guy.
-What are you doing here?-I have a meeting in the building.
I saw you standing hereand I thought Id say hello.
Really? Name one other companyin this building.
Im sorry. Its just...
Ive left some messages for you.
And Ive ignored them.Thats my message for you.
I just wanted to knowwhat you thought of my portfolio.
I threw it out with the box from the coat.
That was a bad idea.
Maybe it was a bad idea,
but werent you trying to get a break once?
Where does your bossthink you are right now?
He knows I want to do what you do.
And what do you think that is?
I think youre a very important manin a very important agency.
Maybe I am risking my job,
but Id do anything to buy you a drinkand hear anything you have to say.
Its 10:00 a.m.
My mother always said,"Be careful what you wish for,
"because youll get it,
"and then people get jealousand try to take it away from you."
I dont think thats how that goes.
Youre an expert on everything, right?
And how can I hire you?You know too much about me.
You know Ive been discreet.
Once you say that,youre not discreet anymore.
I got to get out of here before theyopen for lunch. This is embarrassing.
Ill buy you lunch.
Im stuffed. I had a jar of olives.
And youre a great fur guy.Im gonna need one of those.
Let me get you a cab.
You should go home.
So you use cough dropswhen youre sick in bed,
on a car trip, at the movies and in church.
Anything youd like to add?
-What?-This pencils a little dull.
Maybe I should dip that thingin some ink and write with it.
-Stop looking.-I thought it might make it go away.
You know what? Fine.
Are we getting dressed now?
You can do whatever you want. I dont care.
But you do.
Fine, you win.
Win what?
Win the prize for the smuggest bitchin the world.
I got to take a leak.
Hey, Rizzo! Im hungry.Do you want anything?
What did you win for again?
Cake mixes and toppings.
I wrote the jingle.
Can you hum a few bars?
That sounds familiar.
Okay.
Hello.
So you finally decidedto pick up the phone?
-Where the hell are you?-Who is this?
Its me. Where the hell are you? Its noon.
You were supposed to be heretwo hours ago.
The kids are sitting in the den watching TV,
waiting for someonewho is obviously not coming.
I know you dont carethat Henry and I were supposed to go
to a very important brunch,
but I cant get Carla anymore.Shes in church.
-Im coming on Sunday.-It is Sunday!
Im really sorry, Betts.Im under the weather.
Well, thank you for the notice, Don.Thanks a lot.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Everythings fine.
I cant believe we slept so long.
Is that yours?
No, its yours.
Im really sorry.
I have some things to do.I forgot about them.
You said you were gonna take my pictureand you never did.
-When did I say that?-I dont know.
Somewhere aroundyour third order of French Fries
after your sister left.
My sister?
Was that her on the phone?
-No.-Dont lie to me. its okay, Dick.
Listen, I dont want to getin the middle of anything.
Look,
Im really late.
-I should get ready.-Okay.
Do you mind?
I had a great time, Doris.
Im really sorry I forgot I had plans.
All right. Ill see you around, I guess.
Are you okay?
I tried to call you Friday night,
and yesterday it rang and rangand today its busy.
My phones not working.
Can I come in?
Whats the problem?
I know you dont want to hear this,but the Life Cereal tag you sold,
it was that kids. Rogers idiot.
"Eat Life by the bowlful"?We worked on that for weeks.
No, "The cure for the common breakfast."You changed it in the meeting.
I dont think so.
I know Ive gotten stuffstuck in my brain before
and you dont know where its coming from.
Its that kids.
-Are you sure?-Yes.
Call Life and tell them its terrible
-and we changed our minds.-They loved it.
Its terrible.
Well, neither you nor the clientwas in a condition to notice.
Think of 10 more tags.
No. Ive been workingall weekend with that pig
in that stupid hotel room. I am tapped out.
What hotel room?
You have to bring him in right away.
Tomorrow. Fix it.
Shit.
Mr. Cosgrove is on his way over.Ive added you to our reservation.
No. When he gets herebring him to the conference room.
...and hes coughingand everyones staring at him,
including the priest,then he sucks on a Vicks.
Its good.
-its pretty much how I pitched it.-Thats true.
I only changed one little thing.
Good morning.
Call the Pen & Pencil,see if someone found my award.
Whats the category?
Best actress. Its a CLIO.
Hey.
They told me to wait here.
Your little friend is waiting.
Listen, Danny,
Ive been thinking about thingsand there was a slogan in your book,
"The cure for the common" something.
-Bus, beer, chair? Which one?-All of them.
Im gonna give you $50 for the idea.
You liked it, huh?
What did I just say?
Id like a job.
Fine, $100. Itll be freelance work.Do you know what that is?
Yeah, its not a job.
I dont have to buy it.
I could just use it. Take the money.
I dont need money. I need a job.
You wouldnt even be in this roomif you werent related to Roger.
But I am. its all I have.
That and my ideas.
This place is fantastic.
Lane, could you leave us, please?
Certainly.
Ive given this a lot of thought.
Me, too.
If youre open to the directionand tenor of the business Im doing here,
I think youd be a great addition to my team.
The hells that supposed to mean?
That things have changedin a permanent way.
Id say nothings changed.
Look, Ken, everyone here likes you,
but this is a small shop,and I need to know you can do as told.
So,
how are the wedding plans coming?
Peggy!
Take Danny over to Joan.Hes starting next Monday.
Are you kidding?
You will not be sorry.
Go away.
Wait here.
I always liked chocolate ice cream,but my mother made us eat vanilla,
because it didnt stain anything.
-I hired Janes cousin.-Really?
What changed your mind?
Couldnt live without him.
Well, one good turn deserves another.
You left it at the bar.
Too much celebrating, I guess.
Yeah, that happens.
Ill give it back if you just say one thing.
You couldnt have done it without me.
Did I not say that?
I was wrong.
Thank you.
Mr. Sterling.
-Good morning.-Jesus! Would you leave me alone?
You told me to come in.
-The hell I did.-You hired me.
What? When?
Yesterday. You said, "Welcome aboard."
