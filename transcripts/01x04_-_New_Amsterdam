H- How fast were you going when Mr. Adams jumped from the car?
75?
And...
And where was that?
L- In your driveway?
H- How far had Mr.
Adams gotten in the lesson?
B- Backing out?
Its not Lenny Bruce, but its good.
This is better.
Its funny.
This guy used to be an accountant.
Did you know that?
Really?
Hes not anymore, is he?
Your wife is here, Mr. Campbell.
Thank you, Hildy.
Lunch date.
Good idea.
You married folks.
Must be nice to spend some time together.
Hello, lovely.
You can do better than that.
Trudy, you know the fellas:  Ken, Paul, and Harry, of course.
Youll notice only men coming out of there.
I know you all work so hard.
Hows Jennifer?
Good.
Swell, actually,  considering shes still at the phone company.
Nothing I can do.
Thats not true.
You could give her a baby.
Youll all in on it together.
Nice to see you all again.
Do we have a lunch date?
Because Hildy, she can show you the book.
No, but Im taking you away.
Trudy, I dont think taking you to lunch is part of my job.
Do you have something today?
No.
I thought youd be happy to see me.
I called Hildy and asked if you were free.
Itll only take a minute, I promise.
Im sorry.
Its great.
Where are we going?
Its a surprise.
Ah, Don, Id like you to meet my wife, Trudy Campbell.
Don Draper.
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.
Youre a very lucky girl.
I know.
Most of my friends cant find a good man.
Believe me.
Im the lucky one.
Yes, you are.
Hes essential to the process around here.
I think were almost as happy to have him as you are.
Oh, I dont think thats possible.
Well, maybe youre right.
Nice to meet you.
Hes so nice.
Not at all like what I imagined.
1,500 square feet.
Two nice bedrooms.
I dont know if that includes that maids room.
Have to be a pretty small maid.
Its on the market for 32,  but Elaine, the realtor, says we can get it for 30.
Lovely, you know that I want to give you everything.
We dont have to pay for the whole thing at once.
We can get a mortgage.
Trudy, I make $75 a week.
Now, I know youre not good at math,  but thats $3,500 a year.
Youll make more.
Eventually.
But if we put 10% down,  thats an entire years salary.
Sweetheart, were not in this alone.
Were a young couple that needs a little help.
Did you see the sink in the master bathroom?
Its the same one they have in The Pierre.
Bill it all to Menkens, Fred.
The girl knows where I keep the accounts.
Hello.
Mr. Draper.
Didnt expect to see you back here.
Well, were, uh, screening a television commercial.
Itll probably look better when its breaking up Bonanza.
His work is wonderful.
Hes perfect for Menkens.
So he keeps telling me.
Well, Ill let you see Miss Menken out.
How are you?
Im fine.
My family is fine.
The weather has been spectacular.
Rachel, listen...
What are you doing?
I dont know.
I dont want it to be like this.
Yes, well...
we both know how wed like it to be.
Can we at least have lunch sometime?
I really cant see a reason for that.
"Church bells rang out,  "and the air was filled with flying birds.
"What a joyous parade it was back at the palace.
No king could command anything finer. "  The end.
The end.
Again?
Daddy will see you in the morning.
Helen, come on.
I know youre in there.
Damn it!
Helen!
Open the door!
Excuse me, Miss.
I know you can hear me.
Miss?
Look, can I use your phone?
Im her husband.
Im supposed to see my kids, and I know shes in there.
I just called from the gas station.
No.
Im sorry.
Are you serious?
Im sure you are who you say you are,  but I dont let strange men into my home.
Come on.
Can I come in?
Of course.
Im really sorry.
Im so embarrassed.
I dont know what youre talking about.
Yes, you do.
I was at the window.
Did you let him in?
Yes.
Hes not a bad man.
Do you want some coffee?
Its a joke, really.
Dan hardly saw the kids at all when we were married.
He works in Manhattan.
Life insurance.
Now, all of a sudden, he cant live without them.
Of course, if he does die, Im set.
Im joking.
What happened?
Ill tell you exactly.
He had a lot of friends in the city.
There was poker and tennis, drinks at the River Club.
Turned out none of them were men.
Oh, Im...
Im sorry.
I really just meant tonight what happened.
Please, I figure I might as well say it.
Thats what youve all been guessing anyway, right?
We havent all been doing anything.
Okay.
The strangest part of it  is that I think hes angrier at me than I am at him.
Of course my father got a lawyer,  an army buddy who just hammered the hell out of him.
Ive always loved that house.
Hello.
He has to go right upstairs and have complete quiet for a while.
He works so hard.
I should get back.
My kids are asleep.
Boats in the water.
Your cousin Sara had her baby.
Named it after your Uncle Skip.
I think thats nice.
Everythings all ready in the trunks.
We do hope you and Trudy  will be making it out to the house this summer.
Well try, but Im not sure  Ill be able to take the time off from work.
Work?
Ha.
I still dont understand what you do.
Id hate for you to miss the blackberries.
Run into you at the club, youre working.
At a restaurant, youre working.
Taking people out to dinner,  wining and whoring.
No job for a white man.
Shes made such a nice addition to the table.
So nice and appreciative.
Theres a lot more to it than that.
Advertising.
Really?
See, if someone were to tell me theres a lot more to the law,  Id believe him.
I cant explain how business works to you.
Trudy found an apartment that she likes.
Did she?
Whereabouts?
83rd and Park.
Very nice.
Are you sure you want to be that far uptown?
Its not that far, Dad.
It falls off after 79th.
No, darling.
They fall off after 86th.
Its a very nice area.
It is.
And, well...
its actually kind of expensive,  so were going to need help with the down payment.
Really?
Yes.
No, I dont think thats a good idea.
And why is that?
I just dont think its a good idea.
You thought it was a good idea to help Bud  when he hit that girl on her bike in Montauk last summer.
What did that cost?
I presume its your profession  that is responsible for this lapse in your manners.
Ill pay you back.
Its not about the money, Peter.
You know that.
Why is it so hard for you people to give me anything?
We gave you everything.
We gave you your name.
And what have you done with it?
Did you have a nice visit?
Theyre very keen on us coming out to Fishers Island this summer.
Can they help with the apartment?
I didnt bring it up.
My dads been having some health problems.
Oh, sweetheart.
Whats wrong with him?
Nobody knows.
Walter, hows it going?
Never have much luck,  unless Im playing against Campbell here.
Well, hes known for losing gracefully.
You know our art director, Salvatore Romano.
Did you have a good time in the city last night?
When I come into town,  I like to do my business and go home.
Unwind with the Psalms.
No man should have to live out of a suitcase.
So what do you fellows have for me?
Well, we take for granted the things we need the most:  Water, oil, electricity... steel.
I was thinking about the last time you were here,  looking out this window at this incredible city  and saying...
"Its all steel. "  New York City:  Brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.
The city of Pittsburgh,  brought to you by Bethlehem Steel.
The city of Chicago, Detroit, St.
Louis.
Full-page ads in targeted markets:  Newspapers, trade publications.
Throw in a few billboards  so your employees can brag to their girlfriends.
Theyre kind of plain, arent they?
Reminds me of those WPA ads before the w*r.
Walter, youve been doing this long enough.
We can throw this artwork away in a minute.
But the sentiment, the idea, its so basic,  you feel like you already know it.
You just havent thought of it lately.
Cities are made of steel.
Bethlehem Steel.
I might be wrong, but these feel like ads for cities.
Youre making our company  look like a middleman for another product.
Well, would you prefer an I-beam on a plate  with a pat of butter on it?
No need to get cute, Don.
Just making a point.
Steel is not something that you can buy at the supermarket.
But it is a commodity.
Walter, Im surprised.
I believe this is fairly close to what we had talked about.
We talked about a national strategy  that would involve the virtues of this essential commodity.
I believe it was more specific.
Don, Walter has expressed himself.
Now, Walter, if this does not meet your expectations,  Im sure Don can find something that does,  right, Don?
I hate to be a pain in the ass,  but if they didnt just lay there so flat.
I dont know.
Maybe its because Im not from a city.
They just... bother me.
Look, if we can persuade you  to stay in town another 24 hours...
back at the St. Regis, of course...
it would give us a chance  to come up with something with more impact.
Get you tickets to a Broadway show.
Theres a new one: Uh, Bye Bye Birdie.
I dont like birds, either.
Well, something else, then.
Pete, I think Sal can show Mr. Veith out.
Walt.
Sorry about that.
They are good drawings.
No, the WPA was a very respected style.
20 years ago.
What the hell was that?
Come on, Don.
Thats not the first time someones been unhappy.
Give it a haircut.
Hes a second-time guy anyway.
I could feel that.
And I could feel he was sentences away.
Im that kind of guy.
He didnt like the idea.
Someone hadnt prepared him to like the idea,  an idea he was extremely enthusiastic about three months ago.
Im sorry I didnt lower his expectations enough.
You do your job.
Take him sailing.
Get him in a bathing suit.
Leave the ideas to me.
I have ideas.
Im sure you do.
Sterling Cooper has more failed artists and intellectuals than the Third Reich.
You know what?
I have good ideas.
In fact, I used to carry around a notebook and pen just to keep track.
Direct marketing.
I thought of that.
Turned out it already existed, but I arrived at it independently.
And then I come to this place,  and you people tell me Im good with people,  which is strange  because Id never heard that before.
Draper residence.
Betty?
Helen Bishop.
Are you busy?
Well... no, Im just finishing up dinner.
Of course.
Listen, this may be truly rude, but I was wondering.
Im supposed to be stuffing envelopes at Kennedy Headquarters tonight,  and my sitter just cancelled,  and I hate to back out because, well, you know,  New York State is so important.
I didnt know that.
Well, anyway, I was wondering  if you could come watch the kids for a few hours.
Right now?
You know what?
I shouldnt have asked.
Well, let me just get dinner on the table.
I guess Don can watch the kids.
Really?
Gosh, that would be wonderful.
Take your time.
Put that lemonade into the floor show.
Thats a swell ideal  But how could we do that?
Oh, youre a lifesaver, truly.
I cant tell you how much I appreciate this.
Hiroshima, I know.
Cleaning lady and babysitter are one.
Oh, stop.
Its charming.
Thats beautiful, Glen.
Except he can wake the baby.
Glen, stop that now.
You remember Mrs. Draper?
Shes going to take care of you while Im gone.
No ironing.
Ironing?
I give him 5 cents a piece.
He loves doing it,  Oh, there you are.
I swear to God, I am so exhausted when I get home from the jewelry store  that I just kick these off, and I never know where they end up.
You, Glen Bishop, in bed after The Real McCoys.
No discussions.
You look very nice.
They keep the place poorly lit.
I guess therell be a lot of nice men there.
Yes.
I guess so, although its mostly women.
Have you seen the candidate?
On the news.
Hes handsome.
But Im not sure who were voting for.
Well, Ill bring you back some literature.
Ill be back before 10, I promise.
Glen.
You got to get that Lux soap campaign  over to Sterling Cooper.
Janet Leigh and Natalie Wood...
now, theres a day at the office.
Is that an orange?
Im telling you, you boys, youve got it made.
Martini lunches,  gorgeous women parading through.
In my next life, Im coming back as an ad man.
Well, theres slightly more to it than that.
Yeah?
Well, Id keep that to yourself.
I met his boss yesterday.
You should have heard the nice things he said.
Hes not my boss.
Well, isnt that nice?
To be appreciated for what you do?
We have some great news.
Already?
Honestly, you two.
Its not that.
We found an apartment.
Oh.
Well, thats exciting, too.
Yes, well, unfortunately,  its a bit out of our price range right now.
Ive been looking in the neighborhood,  and it seems very well priced to me:  32, but the realtor says we can get it for 30.
- Around here?
- 83rd, but...
- How many rooms?
- Five:  Two bedrooms, two baths, a terrace.
I dont know.
Id have to look at it first.
Oh, thank you.
Sir...
Ill take Tom or Dad, you got me?
Tom, its very generous for you to even consider it,  but I think wed rather wait.
For what?
Start your life already.
Youre gonna be a rich bastard on your own someday,  and waitings a bunch of bullshit.
- Tomcat.
- It is.
Your confidence is really...
well, its swell.
But honestly, Im not sure its a good idea.
I am.
Pete, this is an investment for me, in you.
And my jellybean over here, of course.
Oh, thank you.
Youre gonna love it.
Well be so happy there.
I knew theyd help us.
I know you did.
Oh, come on.
You cant possibly be angry with me.
Im just not sure taking that kind of money is a good idea.
Hes not paying for the whole thing.
Its still a lot of money,  and Im not sure what it means.
It means we get the apartment.
Do they get to tell us where to put the furniture?
Theyre not like that.
You would have taken money from your parents.
Thats different.
Why?
Because thats my money.
Ill get it eventually.
So this is my money.
Sweetheart, he wants to help.
It makes him feel good.
Well, what about me?
Well, what about me?
You always get what you want, dont you?
I got you.
Thats all I really wanted.
Excuse me.
Can we turn up Park?
I need to meet a client downtown.
Hush.
Itll only take a sec.
The Armory.
When are they gonna tear that dinosaur down?
Ill be right back.
Im in here.
Glen, I said get out.
Young man, what is wrong with you?
This room is occupied.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Glen, look at me.
That was very bad.
You know better than to walk in on someone like that.
That room is private, extremely private.
Well, thats all Im trying to say.
Now look at me.
Dont you think you owe me an apology?


Well?
Im sorry.
Well, good.
Thats not the way to behave, okay?
Now...
Its all right.
Im not angry anymore.
Youre pretty.
Well, thank you, dear.
Really pretty.
Thats sweet of you to say.
How old are you?
Well, Im the same age as your mother.
How old is your mother?
Shes 32.
Im 28.
Your hair is so beautiful.
You look like a princess.
Well, I dont know about that.
Can I have some?
What?
Can I have some of your hair?
Glen, no.
Just a little piece?
Glen.
You wont even miss it.
Now off to bed with you.
And no radio.
Evening, gentlemen.
Walter, Id like you to meet my cousins  Charlotte and Wendy.
Ladies, its a pleasure.
We were hoping you were Petes friends.
You must be the man of steel.
Will you look at that?
You could lose a nickel in those dimples.
I thought your cousin Wendy was a redhead.
No, thats my cousin Doris.
She wasnt available this evening.
Well, I think we can make do with this branch of the family.
Im glad you decided to stay over.
So am I.
Hey, bottle of champagne for the table and another round of these, plus one.
You know, I had some thoughts about your campaign today.
Did you?
Well, I was trying to express the essentialness of steel,  and I thought, Bethlehem Steel:  The backbone of America.
What do you think?
Unbelievable.
Did Draper tell you to try and sneak this one by me?
No.
I was just...
Campbell, get off the clock.
We have two lovely ladies here.
The only backbone Im interested in now is right here.
So, tell me, Wendy, what do you do  when youre not lighting up rooms with your smile?
Well, Im an actress, and I take some classes at Hunter.
Do you?
I would have thought you slept all day and bathed in milk.
How was it?
It was nice.
Very quiet.
Oh.
In case youre interested.
Oh.
Thank you.
Ill be sure to look at it.
I cant thank you enough.
I hope I can return the favor sometime.
Oh, please, dont even think about it.
Looks pretty familiar.
Well, I wanted to maintain our original strategy,  but I think the wordplay achieves what youre looking for:  The idea that from the acorn...
that is, Bethlehem Steel...
comes Americas great cities.
I know this isnt the idea you want to sell me,  so dont sell it so damn well.
Excuse me?
The backbone idea.
Campbell pitched it to me last night.
I like it.
What backbone idea?
Bethlehem Steel: The backbone of America.
Wasnt that it?
Oh, right.
Its concise, strong,  and frankly, I like that you were so enthusiastic about it  you couldnt wait to tell me.
Thanks again, boys.
Pleasure to make you happy, Walt.
Hope your visit to New York was productive.
Im warming to the place.
Nice work.
I told you I had ideas.
Yes, you did.
Good one.
Enjoy it.
You know what I think?
I think I did something good, and you got the compliment for it.
Listen, Pete,  I need you to go get a cardboard box...
and put your things in it.
Okay?
You picked the wrong time to buy an apartment.
H- How far has Mr. Adams gotten in the lesson?
B- Backing out?
Everybody out.
Now!
Uh, did he cover starting the car?
And the other way to stop.
Remember Pete Campbells last day?
Its today.
What happened?
While I was breaking my neck trying to fix the hash he made yesterday,  he was at the St. Regis pitching copy.
His copy.
That little shit.
It was hard to see her all alone like that...
supporting herself with that sad little job at the jewelry store.
Frozen food.
I mean, I know she gets some kind of help,  but still, she looks so exhausted.
She tries to put on a brave face.
Honestly, I think shes jealous of me.
Ive seen it before.
I was in a sorority.
I mean, seeing happy families all around.
But I dont know what I can do.
I cant just disappear.
I live there.
Of course, my real concern is those children.
I mean, the baby wont know the difference,  but that poor little boy.
The person taking care of him isnt giving him what he needs.
You know?
Gentlemen, please.
You really love that thing.
You were cute back then.
Pete Campbell.
On his way out.
Sorry to hear that.
Cant be avoided, Im afraid.
I wish I could agree with that.
Hes a junior account executive  who brought his own idea to a client in a bar.
There are rules.
There are other rules.
Whats the problem?
New York City is a marvelous machine  filled with a mesh of levers and gears and springs,  like a fine watch wound tight.
Always ticking.
Sounds more like a b*mb.
How much do you know about Petes family?
Nothing, except they put out a mediocre product.
His mother is Dorothy Dykeman Campbell.
The Dykemans owned pretty much everything  north of 125th Street,  which I dont know how good your geography is,  but thats a fair chunk of the island.
So theyre rich.
So what?
Well, no.
Uh, his grandfather dropped it all in 29.
Panicked.
Some people have no confidence in this country.
Whats your concern, then?
Well, I dont want Dorothy Dykeman Campbell  standing on the dock at Fishers Island this summer  talking about how badly Sterling Cooper treated her son.
I dont think any of us want that.
We lose him,  we lose our entree to Buckley, DKE,  the Maidstone Club, the Century Club,  Dartmouth...
Gracie Mansion sometimes.
Its a marquee issue for us.
See my point?
Absolutely.
Hes more valuable to the agency than I am.
Dont fool yourself.
Theres a Pete Campbell at every agency out there.
Well, lets get one of the other ones.
Youre going to need a stronger stomach  if youre going to be back in the kitchen seeing how the sausage is made.
Thought it was a big watch.
You handle the words.
You know how much we want you here with us.
No doubt about that.
Dons a big boy, Bert.
Arent you, Don?
Well, thank you, sir.
There you go.
Im glad were all better now.
What you did is totally unacceptable.
I realize that.
I want you to be very clear about this.
You were fired.
I wanted you out.
Cooper wanted you out.
And you would be if it werent for this man.
He thought you deserved another chance.
Thats right.
He fought for you.
I dont know what to say.
Say nothing.
Youre here because of Don Drapers largesse.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Now, I know that your generation went to college instead of serving,  so Ill illuminate you:  This man is your commanding officer.
You live and die in his shadow.
Understood?
I wont let you down, Don.
Jesus, Campbell.
Dont ever say that.
I bet daily friendship with that bottle attracts more people to advertising  than any salary you can dream of.
Its why I got in.
So enjoy it.
Im doing my best here.
Oh, youre not.
You dont know how to drink, your whole generation.
You drink for the wrong reasons.
My generation, we drink because its good.
Because it feels better than unbuttoning your collar.
Because we deserve it.
We drink because its what men do.
What about shaky hands?
I see a lot of that, too, with you boys.
No joke.
Your kind with your gloomy thoughts and your worries,  youre all busy licking some imaginary wound.
Not all imaginary.
Yeah, boo-hoo.
Maybe Im not as comfortable being powerless as you are.
Pardon?
You know, you shouldnt compete with Pete Campbell.
Im not.
Yeah.
You are.
Not at a personal level, but for the world.
I dont know.
Maybe every generation thinks the next one is the end of it all.
I bet there are people in the Bible  walking around complaining about kids today.
Kids today, they have no one to look up to...
because theyre looking up to us.
Of course, if youre not going to have live-in help,  that back room can be used for any number of things.
I dont think well be having live-in help just yet, do you, sweetheart?
No, I think well be managing on our own for now.
Oh, Im so glad you could come.
Id like you to meet Mrs. Clifford Lyman.
Shell be one of your new neighbors,  and shes on the co-op board.
Of course you know these two.
Wheres the nursery at?
Thank you, Tom.
I dont want to hear that again.
Mrs. Lyman, Trudy Campbell.
So nice to meet you.
Well, arent you darling?
The two of you.
A pleasure.
Now, I know I shouldnt ask, but I have to.
Your mother-in-law was just telling me  that your great-great-grandfather was a farmer with Isaac Roosevelt?
Is that right?
Um, yes.
Thats true.
That was Nicholas Dykeman, right?
On his mothers side.
Can you imagine orchards on 204th Street?
Hes buried at the Church of the Intercession.
Oh, my goodness.
Wait until I tell my husband  theres going to be a Dykeman living in the building.
Hell be so thrilled.
Sweetheart, tell Mrs. Lyman the story about your great-great aunt  getting in that fight with the British soldier and the Hessian.
You tell it, dear.
You tell it so much better than I do.
Well, I think it was his great-great aunt,  or great-great-great...
Im not sure...
but it was before the Revolutionary w*r,  and the Dykemans owned a large tract of land  just north of Central Park.
Of course, it wasnt called Central Park back then, but...
