Hold the doors, please!
Thank you. Good morning.
Good morning.
Draper has you in early, huh?
- Whats he up to?- I dont know.
I kind of came in for myself.
Okay.
Honestly, I couldnt sleep.
Im just filled with nerves.
The service elevator is out.
Do you mind?
Im moving today.
Im supposed to go by at lunchand supervise the movers.
Probably lose the rest of the daywatching other people work.
Well, that is a big day.
What do you haveto be nervous about?
Nothing.
Just I think Mr. Rumsen is presentingmy copy today to the Belle Jolie people.
A thing like that.
We really took the local, didnt we?
Its 7 in the morning.
Im very sorry, sir.
Here we are.
Im going to hop down for a coffee.
- Would you like some?- No.
Are you sure?
Come in here, please.
Close the door.
Theres no one here.
Close the door.
Peggy... do you know how hard it is
to see you walkingaround here every day?
Your skirt. Its tight.
Just pull it up.
Be careful.
Listen,
maybe this isntthe right time to mention this,
but I want to clear the air.
I know I told you I would readthe copy that you wrote,
but... I havent.
Im glad.
I thought you just didnt like it.
Thats too bad.
Peggy.
I know what youre going to say.
No.
You dont.
You havent been right once.
I have all these things going onin my head, and I cant say them.
Do you think about me?
Ill be honest.
A few times.
Youre only 20 yards away.
Not right now.
I wake up in the morningand I look into Trudys eyes,
and I think, "Were supposedto be one person. "
But whatever I try...
I have all these thingsgoing on in my head.
Shes just another stranger.
Pete.
Youre not alone in this.
Im sorry I ripped your blouse.
Its okay.
Morning. Sterling Cooper. Please hold.
Look whos off the clock again.
Hes speaking Italian to his mother.
Ciao, ciao.
My stars.
Two weeks in, and shes already a goner.
He talks to his mother a lot.
Mr. Crane? Ill connect you.
Because hes not married.
Well, hes in the Art Department?
What does he look like?
Did you see that movie Martywith Ernest Borgnine?
He lived with his mother.
Stop teasing her.
Yes, right away.
My guess is tall, dark, and handsome,
but Im a glass-half-full kind of gal.
She is so thoughtful.
- Let me get my purse.- Forget it.
Mrs. Sterling will be callingbefore lunchtime today.
Please put her through directly to me.
- Done.- Ask her. Shell know.
Salvatore Romano in the Art Department.
Do you know him?
Handsome. Very debonair.
Cologne, but not the cheap stuff.
Something European, maybe.
Youre so specific.
You have voices. I have other things.
Thank you so much for holding.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Cooper wantedto see you in his office.
Tell Mr. Sterling Ill be right there.
No, its just Mr. Cooper.
Thank you, Peggy.
What happened there?
I caught it on something.
I might start keeping a spare.
Come on in.
Id prefer you didntsmoke in here right now.
Don, I am appreciative of your talents,
and although that cannot be measured,
I have made an effort to quantify.
$2,500.
L...
Thank you. Thats what you say.
Have you read her?
Rand.
Atlas Shrugged.
Thats the one.
Yes. Yes, it is.
See, I know you havent read it.
When you hit 40,
you realize youve met or seenevery kind of person there is,
and I know what kind you are.
Because I believe we are alike.
I assume thats flattering.
By that I mean you are a productiveand reasonable man,
and in the end completely self-interested.
Its strength.
We are different...
unsentimental about all the people
who depend on our hard work.
Take $1.99 out of that $2,500and buy yourself a copy.
I will.
Well, hello, there.
Hello.
Are you Traffic, or are you here for casting?
Im... Im not a model.
Im new.
Excuse me, Marty,
whos doing the Firestone comps,you or Frank?
Neither of us. Sal.We were talking to Miss...
Lois. Lois Sadler.
Im new here. Switchboard.
Marty Faraday.
Why would they hide you?
Hi, Lois. Duane Davis.
Salvatore Romano.
Sorry about the mess.
Oh, no, its divine.
I work in a closet all day,
so just to come outand walk around is wonderful.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Im such a featherhead.
I need to get my paperworkin to Accounting,
then find my way backto the switchboard room.
Am I close?
No. Youre not even on the right floor.
Ill walk you there.
No. Just point me there. Im fine.
Go upstairs,
make a left outside of the stairwell,
follow the wall past the ladies room.
Well, nice to meet you.
Ciao, ciao.
That ate up some time.
I like when they flirt with me.
She was flirting with him.
You know, I had the salesmanpushing this tie on me for 20 minutes.
Id have bought it right awayif I knew it worked.
Its not the ties.They always talk to you.
They can tell you make money.
I told you, you dont need moneyto dress better than you do, Duane.
Mr. Campbell, I have your wife.
What line?
Light up a line, will you?
No, shes right here, in person.
Send her in.
Hello, my love.
Hello, homeowner.
What are you doing here, lovely?
I thought Id come get youand we could go together.
We could even walk.
Its 30 blocks.
Its beautiful outside.
I have a, uh, busier day than I thought.
Well, then lets do this here.
I said Id meet you thereif my schedule allowed,
and now it doesnt look so good.
No, you didnt, and Im here now.
What does it matter?
This is my office.
How do you think it looks?
Like you are beloved by your wife.
You see what happenswhen you just show up like this?
We fight.
I came here to celebrateus having our apartment,
which I for one am happy about.
And you have ruined it.
Im sorry.
Im just busier than I thought.
Lets have a glass of champagne.
Im sorry.
Were going to live there a long time.
Theres no point in being superstitious.
Its as simple as E pluribus unum:
"From many, one. "
From many shades of lipstick,one that belongs to her.
From a basket of kisses,she picks one.
It makes her unique. It colors her kiss.
And her kiss, well, it colors her man.
"Belle Jolie Lipstick. Mark Your Man. "
I only see one lipstick in your drawing.
Women want colors,lots and lots of colors.
"Mark Your Man. "
Its pretty cute.
Oh, you like this?
Well, maybe we should cutdown to five shades or one.
Im not telling you to listen to anyone,but this is a very fresh approach.
Its okay, Kenny.
I dont think theres much elseto do here but call it a day.
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.
Is that all?
Youre a nonbeliever.
Why should we waste time on Kabuki?
I dont know what that means.
It means that youvealready tried your plan,
and youre number 4.
Youve enlisted my expertise,
and youve rejected it to go onthe way youve been going.
Im not interested in that.You can understand.
I dont think your three monthsor however many thousands of dollars
entitles you to refocusthe core of our business.
Listen, Im not here to tell you about Jesus.
You already know about Jesus.
Either He lives in your heartor He doesnt.
Every woman wants choices,
but in the end, none wants to be oneof a hundred in a box.
Shes unique.
She makes the choices,and shes chosen him.
She wants to tell the world, "Hes mine.
He belongs to me, not you. "
She marks her man with her lips.
He is her possession.
Youve given every girlthat wears your lipstick
the gift of total ownership.
Sit down.
No.
Not until I know Im not wasting my time.
Sit down.
Do you know how to getback to the Roosevelt?
We could have someone walk you over,or just meet you, if youre interested.
Youre a troublemaker.
Although, it is a place to get into trouble.
They just did this incredible renovation.
It reminds me a little of a steamship.
And the people...
I was in the lounge last night,
and I end up having a drinkwith Robert Mitchum.
Actually, many drinks.
Now, you know we wouldntsteer you wrong.
Nice work.I think you may be right about this.
Well, well never know, will we?
What?
Its not a science, Hugh.
Well do our best.
That Jesus thing.
I dont know what to say.
Probably better than dangling himout the window by his ankles.
Thats just a story.
Dons never actually done that.
Ken, you will realize in your private life
that at a certain point seduction is overand force is actually being requested.
Ah, hes a kid.
He thinks its the other way around.
Peggy, icel Well need some.
Should I just put it down?
How much ice?
How do you take it?
Home run, ballerina.
Go ahead, beforeJoan Holloway sees.
You call that celebrating?
The meeting was so long, I was worried.
We barely finished the presentation,and he bought it.
No, hes being modest.
Donald walked aroundthe village three times
and then set it on fire.
Oh, my God. Can I see it?
Its marvelous.
I thought it was going to say
"Its the markyou make on your man. "
Was it, now?
You may be a writer, honey.
Really?
Youre arrogant.
You want another drink?
I dont know.
- Not a writer.- Not a writer.
Can I keep it?
No.
What are you doing?
Dont ever put your name on a list.
They keep track of everything we do here.
Have you never heardof Joseph McCarthy?
Its the bowling team.
Oh, my God. It happened.
- They loved it.- What are you talking about?
Im heading out. Dont look for me.
I have errands to run.
My Belle Jolie copy. They loved it.
Congratulations!
Thats so fascinating!
Im glad your other workwas suffering for a reason.
They poured me a drink.
- Who?- Mr. Draper.
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Romano, and...
Oh, Im so jealous.
Dont be. I was just...I shouldnt be bragging.
They sold Peggys copy.
My word.
Actually, they changed it a little bit,
but it worked.
- Oh, were celebrating.- How about it?
Five minutes to 5,we head to P.J. Clarkes.
Perfect!
Its going to be a hell of an afternoontraffic meeting.
Oh, champagne.
When did that happen?
Another grateful client stopped by.
I thought you were moving today.
I was looking forward to seeing youin a pair of coveralls.
Yes, well, I managed to explainto the concerned party
that I already have a job.
Do they ever stop asking for things?
Hello.
Hello.
Hildy, um, she must havegone to lunch already.
Congratulations.
Yes. I hear youre quite the little scribe.
You can trust Kens opinion here.
Hes a published author, you know.
But he cant write copy.
I dont like to limit my words that much.
I also hate puns.
Come on.
"Admiral: The televisionthat wont go down the tubes. "
Shut up.
So you going to celebrate?
Well, yes, actually.
A bunch of us... just the girls so far...are going to P. J. Clarkes tonight.
Forget tonight. I heard Cooper, Sterling,and Draper already left.
Am I wrong?
What about Mr. Rumsen?
Freddie Rumsens at P.J.s right now,
and he doesnt know theres a party.
3:00, after the traffic meeting.
Joans a tattletale.
I dont know, Peggy.
Im kind of senior rankingwhen those other men are gone.
Speaker of the House.Hell be there.
I should probably go home, actually.
Well, if were starting at 3,you can go home at 5.
Itll still be after work.
We all work so hard,
I think we all need it.
Why not?
Toodle-oo.
Hello.
Mr. Romano, I was headed out to lunch,
but I have a phone call for you.
Well, Im glad I stayed in.
Oh, its disconnected.
Everybodys talking about the meeting.
Miss Olsen said your artworkwas spectacular.
She did, did she?
Anyway, a bunch of us
are taking her out to drinks.
P.J. Clarkes?
She deserves it.
You have to come.
This is Lois Sadler, by the way.
I know that.
Ill be there.
Good.
Can I help you?
Can I help you, sir?
Its Don. The ad man.
Hes okay.
Excuse me, fellas.
Oh, just because I cant call youdoesnt mean you cant call me.
Hello.
Pack a bag. Were going to Paris.
- What?- Paris.
Now?
Whered you get that?
Its a bonus.
Im not sure what for.
I bet.
What do you say?
I called Idyllwild.
We can have breakfast at Versailles.
Im sorry.
I have a special night planned.
I thought you didnt make plans.
Is he joining us?
Yes. He has to.
He looks kind of square.
Kibby just came four days straightfrom Juarez.
May I?
Ive been thinking about thissince Port Authority.
Stay. Youll love it.
Were going to get high and listen to Miles.
Thats your plan?
We can do this first and then do that.
Itll be a lot more fun.
Sit down. Relax.
Next to me, Icky.
Where did you find him?
You know you need to leave the Villagefor a decent screw.
Ill take care of him.
Do you like it?
I feel like Dorothy.
Everything just turned to color.
The words.
You are good with the words, man.
Well put.
Kibby, why dont you make yourself usefuland get me a glass of water?
My word, I need to get one of those.
No, thanks.
Okay.
Maybe.
We realize theres no music playing.
Just the...
Good afternoon, maam.
Im embarrassed to ask,seeing as we all have it hard right now,
but is there any wayI can trouble you for a meal?
Im willing to work for it.
Look around you.
Were not Christians here no more.
That is not true.
Fine, fine.
Work will feed your soul,
but theres no work left here today.
Come back tomorrow?
Nonsense.
Youll stay with us and eat with us,
and work tomorrow.
I will have to boil those clothes, though,
if youre going to sit at my table.
Im not offended.
It would be a relief to me as well.
Dick Whitman, stop digging holes.
Build a fire under the cauldron.


Hiya, kid.
What did I say to you?
Reminds me of myself.
That doesnt surprise me at all.
So we thank You, Lord,
for this bounty we are about to receive
that we may share it with those in need.
Amen.
Thank you again.Thank you so much.
This smells delicious.
Where are those manners from?
Let him eat and be on with it.
Im from just east.
About New York, originally,some other places.
Ah. New York.
Its how you took to beingon the bum so easy.
Archie, no one takes to charity easy.
Im just saying I bet he dont knowwhich end of a weed to pull.
Thats the truth, sir.I only know some farm work,
but Ive seen mills and docks and factories.
Ive been a worker.
Are you a communist?
No.
Yeah, I imagine theyre different, all right.
They take a club to the jawlike anyone else.
They are souls,but they cant be saved.
Thats true.
My mom always saidthat life is like a horseshoe.
Its fat in the middle,open on both ends,
and hard all the way through.
Tomorrow...
when youve finished some work.
Bless you.
I had to see this place for myself.
Good.
Its something, huh?
No Bob Mitchum?
What are you drinking?
Campari with a twist.
You know, when I mentionedthe renovation,
I didnt know if you heard me.
Ive been curious about seeing this place.
Im actually involved with architectson this department store.
Signage, mostly.
I like this room,although I am its prime target:
Traveling salesman.
In that suit? I should say not.
No, Im not one of those boyswho looks forward to a business trip
to escape the wife and kids.
Im really a homebody.
But New York?
When you arrive,
and that train starts slowing down
and it gets all dark,
my heart pounds, and I think,
"Im going to climb that staircaseand be in New York. "
I take it for granted.
It is a masterpiece of some kind.
Wherever Im staying,I always demand a view.
Its building after building.
Little compartmentsfilled with possibilities.
Whats that from?
42nd Street?
What?
Uh, no.
No. Im just saying its...
its like you can do anything.
Im two ahead of you.
I have to eat something,
or Im going to continue to rhapsodize.
What time is it?
I bet you dont have an expense account.
Im not saying Peggydoesnt have something upstairs.
Im just saying at Sterling Cooper
things are usually happening downstairs.
I didnt know that.
My God, the whole office is here.
I dont see the Art Department.
What about those two?
Uh, I think I had too much to drink.
You are very petite.
Going back to the well. Interested?
Dance with me.
I dont like you like this.
Literally, "With flies. "
The espresso beans mean health, wealth,
and, um, happiness.
Seems redundant,
I mean, if you alreadyhave health and wealth.
So, are you happy?
Im one of those people
who thinks the minute you askthat, youre not happy, so...
no.
Youre loud, but youre shy.
I feel like Im getting my fortune told.
Im sorry.
Ah, its fine.
So what do you want to do?
Uh... I dont know.
Maybe break off with one of the writers,
have my own little shop
where copy follows artand not the other way around.
No, I mean my view.
You have to see it.
Its all the way to the park.
Of course its dark now.
I dont know.
May I?
I...
dont know what to say.
Its Elliot.
And, Salvatore, you donthave to say anything.
No, I... I just...
No.
Have another drink. Think about it.
Elliot,
I have thought about it.
I know what I want.
I know what I want to do.
I know what youre thinking.
Ill show you.
What are you afraid of?
Are you joking?
This... has been a pleasure.
Don, are you all right?
I dont know.
Its always the same thing!
Its probably the guy in 2F.
He uses his wife like a speed bag.
Oh, man.
I was going to truck downfor some carrot juice.
Wait, wait.
Thank you.
Smoke?
No.
He speaks.
Im supposed to tell youto say your prayers.
Praying wont help you from this place, kid.
Best keep your mind on your mother.
Shell probably look after you.
She aint my momma.
We all wish we werefrom someplace else, believe me.
Aint you heard?
Im a whore child.
No. I hadnt heardanything about that.
You dont talk like a bum.
Im not. Im a gentleman of the rails.
For me, every day is brand-new.
Every days a brand-new place,
people, what have you.
So you got no home.
Thats sad.
Whats at home?
I had a family once:
A wife, a job, a mortgage.
I couldnt sleep at nighttied to all those things.
Then death came to find me.
Did you see him?
Only every night.
So one morning, I freed myselfwith the clothes on my back.
Good-bye.
Now I sleep like a stone:
Sometimes under the stars, the rain.
The roof of a barn.
But I sleep like a stone.
So where do you go?
Tomorrow Ill be leaving this place,
thats for certain.
If death was cominganyplace, its here, kid,
creeping around every corner.
Here.
Youre an honorary.
This is how we talk to each other.
On the front gate of every house,theres a mark.
Its a code, just likeyou heard on the radio.
See...
Thats a pie.
It means the food here is good.
This one...
That means watch outfor the nasty dog.
This one here...
That means a dishonest man lives here.
And this one...
That means tell a sad story.
Here.
Dont be scared, kid.
You aint a man yet.
Of course.
What?
You two.
Youre in love.
What?
Thats ridiculous.
Every day I make pictureswhere people appear to be in love.
I know what it looks like.
Looks like a magazine.
Love is bourgeois.
Youre breaking my heart.
Dig. Ad mans got a heart.
The grownups are talking.
Dont defend him.
Toothpaste doesnt solve anything.
Dacron sure as hell wont bring backthose ten dead kids in Biloxi.
Neither will buying some Tokaj wine
and leaning up against a wallin Grand Central
pretending youre a vagrant.
You know what its like to watchall you ants go into your hive?
I wipe my ass with the Wall Street Journal.
How come every time we have a party,
the ladies have to sitand listen to the men talk?
Look at you...
satisfied,
dreaming up jinglesfor soap flakes and spot remover,
telling yourself youre free.
Oh, my God. Stop talking.
Make something of yourself.
Like you?
You make the lie.
You invent want.
Youre for them...
not us.
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but there is no big lie.
There is no system.
The universe is indifferent.
Man, whyd you have to say that?
Paris.
Now. Lets go.
Don.
No, I cant.
Buy yourself a car.
Don.
The cops.
You cant go out there.
You cant.
Good evening.
Wake up, Bobby.
Come on, kiddo.
Daddy.
Your sisters sleeping.
Ask me anything.
What?
Anything.
Im tired.
Ask me.
Uh, why do lightning bugs light up?
I dont know.
But I will never lie to you.
Well, sir, I believe that does it.
Ill be on my way.
Thank you, again,for sharing your home.
Good luck to you.
Be on your way already.
Good morning, Peggy.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
