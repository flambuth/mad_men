I like this for the powder room,but definitely not the bedroom.
Its a little busy.
Im not sure.
Its not the curtains Im worried about, but the cabinets.
Nixon didnt stand a chance.
The Browns trounced the Redskins,   -  .
The result of that last home game
has correctly predicted the last six elections.
I wish someone would have told me that.
Of course, its really a   /   chance of being right.
I want to treat you like a son because...I feel that way towards you.
Okay.
Trudy told us that you were up for a promotion
and you didnt get it or something.
I wish she hadnt.
Now, she loves you.
And honestly,
I think you need to take a little focus off your work.
This from one of the top salesmen at Vicks Chemical.
When you started talking
about that Clearasil company you bought...
Now, that was kind of worth bragging about.
Did you know that theres a surge in adolescence right now?
Ill tell you, Sterling Cooper and yours truly
would love to help you deliver that message.
See? Now thats what Im talking about.
The only family and business you should be mixing
is the production of a child.
And what did Trudy say about that?
About what?
Tom, loose lips sink ships.
I was just saying that work isnt everything, you know.
Its like that song says: Um, tend your own garden.
What song is that, Daddy?
Uh, I dont know.
People say it. Its true.
It is true.
Yeah. Tend to your own garden.
That means... you know, start growing things.
Daddy!
Youre embarrassing us.
Itll be the best Christmas present this one ever had.
And hell, Thanksgivings Thursday.
Oh, and I guess I should go to Keppler Farmto get some acorn squash.
What am I doing? They have squash there.
Ery good squash, actually.
I wish you would come.
Birdie, Im a partner.
  % of my business rolls out next week.
It just seems silly for me
to go down there for a   -hour Thanksgiving.
What about... Sally and Bobbys childhood memories?
There was no reason you couldnt have it up here.
You know my brothers children are animals.
They cant make the trip up here,
and I dont want my dad to be alone.
Ill take a cab to the train, and William will pick us up,
probably in some new car.
You know what? I...
I dont think you want to go.
Im sorry. Was I unclear about that?
I dont understand
why you cant make my family your family.
Ken is perfectly happy to have me here.
What do you think its like? Hes a bachelor. Its dirty.
Im not complaining.
I dont think its a good ideato spend money on a hotel right now.
If youre so worried about my well-being, let me come home.
Thats not what I meant.
I mean, I know how it sounded.
Jennifer.
Yes.
Ill quit if you let me come home.
I miss you...
so much.
Those the legendary secret files of Bert Cooper?
No.
I got a call from Abraham Menken.
Im sure you know that his daughter will be unavailable
for the next three months,
taking some sort of ocean voyage to Paris and whatnot.
I hadnt heard that.
But otherwise?
There is no otherwise.
Why is this man calling me?
I dont know. Is he unhappy?
As a partner, I do not expect your personal preferences
to interfere with our business.
Who says they have?
It was the tone of his voice.
Hes her father.
Thats it, cowboy.
Francine.
Im coming in. Im freezing.
Youre in your slippers.
Ive been outside waiting for you to come home,
just sitting in the car hoping no one would see me.
Whats going on?
Are your kids home?
No. What happened?
Im so stupid.
So damn stupid.
Youre not, Francine.
Whatever happened, youre not stupid.
My mind hasnt been so sharp since I had the baby.
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,
and honestly I think I just threw it away.
And four days later, the phone was cut off,
so I had to go to the phone companyand pay it, or, you know, hed have a fit.
And I had to do all this without him knowing.
How perfect.
I dont understand.
They gave me the bill.
It was close to $  .
There were all these calls:
Long distance, MH.
MH? Manhattan?
So I called one.
A woman answered.
I had just...
I said, "Im calling from Carlton Hansons office."
She said, "Really?"
I said, "He wants to have dinnertonight at the usual place."
What made you say that?
What woman would he be calling in Manhattan
who answers her own phone?
Married women.
Lots of women answer their own phones.
So hes calling some married woman from my house
while Im upstairs sleeping?
Maybe its a caterer.
Maybe hes throwing you a surprise party.
Do you know he spends two nights a week at the Waldorf?
Im so stupid.
Assuming the worst...
The worst is that Ill poison him.
Hes so stupid, hed drink anything.
Im going to have a house full of people.
Ill poison them all:
His parents, my parents...
my kids.
Stop it.
Stop that, Francine.
Youre emotional. It doesnt mean...
Damn it, Betty. I know everything.
What am I going to do?
Ive been sitting outside in the car.
What do I do? I thought youd know what to do.
Me? I... Why?
I dont know.
Im s...
so embarrassed.
He doesnt know you know.
I know that.
Go on upstairs.
I should go.
Come on, Bobby, lets go play in my room.
No. Dont.
Itll be okay.
Mrs. Draper, sorry Im late.
Oh. Its okay, Carla. You can go.
You want me to unpack the groceries?
Ill do it. Just go.
Good-bye.
First things first.
When I call a meeting,
if you arrive after me, you are late.
Boys, the stock in our stable:
Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Maytag.
No automobile, airline, pharmaceuticals.
Tobacco is on that list.
Youre Cosgrove, right?
The powerhouse behind the Rejuvenator?
Actually, its called the Relax-a-Cizor now.
What the hell is it?
Its a weight loss device with a female pleasure payload.
Really?
Im offering a hundred-dollar bonus
to the first man who brings mea meeting with a decision maker.
Gentlemen, heres a list of peopleyou should be having lunch with.
I want you to run into people, go through old yearbooks.
This means everybody. Writers, too.
Bringing in business is the key
to your salary, your status, and your self-worth.
I went to the Athletic Club today,
and I sat in the steam for an hour and a half.
In that time, I lost   pounds
and learned that Kodak still isnt happy
with the campaign for the new slide projector.
Is any of this sinking in?
"Its true that while simply relaxing,
"I can get all the benefits of calisthenics.
"A simple regimen of three   -minute sessions per week,
"combined with a sensible diet,
"will restore your youthful glow.
"I love the way it makes me feel.
"The Relax-a-Cizor.
Its my little secret."
Thank you, Annie.
Uh, one more time... Rita.
"I never thought it would happen to me,
"but I regained my youth and my happiness.
- Just ask my husband."- Todd?
I think were both going to agree on Annie.
Which one is Annie?
Believe it or not, I like Rita.
Shes got that voice: Randy and knowing,
like the Relax-a-Cizor.
Annie belongs on TV with Ritas voice dubbed in.
Norma, thank you.
You can go.
Whatever the...
special properties of the Relax-a-Cizor are,
what we are selling is confidence, a better you.
That woman isnt a better anything.
Annie is a confident, beautiful woman,and you can hear it in her voice.
I cant believe Im in this argument.
Sorry about that, Rita.
Hi, Annie. Well do this tomorrow.
Check with Peggy here for your session.
If I get a hard time about this,
Im telling people it was your idea.
It was my idea.
Just a minute. Ill be right back.
Do you have to?
Peter.
Thats risky business.
It is, isnt it?
What, honey?
You can say anything to me.
I cant provide for a child on what I make.
Dont worry about that.
How could I not?
You cant.
Really?
You cant worry about that.
So stay here.
Oh... Peter.
Hi, Birdie.
Its  :  . Why didnt you just stay in the city?
Oh, I have work to do here as well.
Do you know where the slide projector is?
So youre not going to see us for four days,
and youre not going to see us now.
Bets, right when I walk in the door?
Im sorry.
Im sorry. I just... I had a terrible day.
Sit with me.
What happened?
Francine told me
Carlton has been having an affair.
Really?
She was in pieces, Don.
I didnt know what to say to her.
Well, what could you say?
Im surprised she told you.
Why?
Shes like a sister to me.
Of course she is.
I never liked Carlton.
He was never my favorite.
She should poison him.
Now you think she should k*ll him?
How could someone do that to the person that they love?
That they have children with?
Doesnt this all mean anything?
Who knows why people do what they do?
Come on.
Bring the wine.
Its actually a hell of a gadget.
Its continuous, doesnt jam.
They call it the Doughnut or the Wheel.
Theyre expecting something along those lines.
Kodak reinvented the wheel.
Theyre going to hear that ten times.
They want you to use the words Researchand Development in the ads.
But if you could find a way to put the Wheel and the Future
into something with some legs,
you could make me look good my first month here.
"I never thought it would happen to me,
"but I regained my youth and my happiness.
"Just ask my husband.
"I swear, he looks at me like the night we met.
"Its true that while simply relaxing
I can get all the benefits of"...
Im sorry. We have to get a level here.
No, we dont.
She doesnt sound very confident.
She just started.
Give her a direction.
Okay, Annie.
Confidence.
Okay.
"I never thought it would happen to me,
"but I regained my youth and my happiness.
"Just ask my husband.
I swear, he looks at me like the night we met."
Annie.
Yes?
Are you married?
No.
I could have told you that.
Well, try and imagine youre you, Annie,
and now you have everything.
Youre beautiful, youre slim,
youre the beloved prize of a handsome man,
and you have everything when you use the Relax-a-Cizor.
Okay.
Its too bad your voice is so annoying.
"I never thought it would happen to me,
"but I regained my youth and my happiness.
Just ask my husband."
Hold on, Annie.
We have a problem with the tape recorder.
Say something to her.
Make her feel beautiful.
You know, the confidence that comes with beauty.
Pegs, a woman who looks like that will never sound confident
because she never is confident.
Baloney.
Honey, its Gods gift to bachelors.
The juiciest gazelle is the easiest to catch.
Can I... I have a bit of a cold in my throat.
Can I get some pineapple juice?
Theres a glass of water in the corner.
Its great for your throat.
I didnt believe that, either.
Lets try it again, Annie.
Happy, confident, beautiful.
"I never thought it would happen to me,
"but I regained my youth and my happiness.
"Just ask my husband.
I swear, he looks at me like the night we"...
Annie.
Youre married.
Maybe you put on a few pounds,
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,
and youre back to being you, right now.
I dont know that I understand.
Annie, what dont you understand?
I am being me.
Just give me a second.
Ill get it the way you want it.
"I never thought it would happen to me, but"...
"I never thought this would happen to me, but..."
"I never thought it would happen to me, but"...
Look, Pegs, you dangled her in front of me,
and now youre ruining it.
Dont do that to me.
Kenny, be professional, would you?
This is not working out.
Were going to have to let you go.
You could have gone in there and said that.
In this order,
I want you to go after her and console her.
And after you make plans or whatever you need to do,
call Rita.
The older lady you liked?
Shes probably home with the Relax-a-Cizor right now.
Can you get me the, uh...
the Brighton Hotel, Times Square?
Brighton.
Yes. Uh, sorry to bother you so late.
Im looking for someone.
A tenant of yours
some... some months back.
A guest.
Yes. Uh,
Id love to know if he left a forwarding address.
His name is...
Adam Whitman.
Right. Can I ask what you want?
Just a forwarding address.
Im trying to contact him.
He has red hair...
over   feet.
Now listen. I know who youre talking about.
Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this,
but he hung himself.
What?
Yeah.
Adam Whitman.
Yeah. Im sorry.
Left the building a bunch of money.
The city took it.
It was in the Post.
Oh.
Well,
I hate to be the one to give that news.
Okay.
Hello.
Yes. Hello.
Who is this?
Who is this?
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you, this is inappropriate.
Are we on fire?
Don.
No. I, uh... dropped a cigarette in my waste basket.
Harry, come here. I want to talk to you.
Okay.
Harry, I want to talk to you.
I can explain.
What is the benefit of that thing?
It sells projectors to people who already have them.
Yeah, the wheel.
Stacks, you store your slides in it,
and its ready to go.
I took pictures for the paper at Wisconsin.
The machinery is definitely part of the fun.
Its mechanical.
What did you take pictures of?
Girls, mostly.
You could go up and ask them their names afterwards
like you were going to put it in the paper.
And some other stuff.
Artsy-craftsy stuff.
They gave me hell about it.
Artsy, like what?
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?
Uh, worse.
I did a whole series that was just handprints on glass.
You know, the way it fogs up around your heat.
Take it off, take a picture.
Black and white, I suppose.
Of course.
I was always fascinated by the cave paintings of Lascaux.
Theyre, like,   ,    years old.
The bison get all the attention,
but there are also all of these handprints,
tiny by todays standards,
with paint blown all around them.
Signature of the artist.
But I thought it was like someone...
reaching through the stone and right to us.
"I was here."
Are you okay?
Thatll be all.
Glen?
Im not supposed to talk to you.
Who says... Who said that?
My mother and my father.
I dont care.
My mothers going to come out.
I dont care.
Glen...
I cant talk to anyone.
Its so horrible.
Im so sad.
Dont cry.
Please...
Please tell me Ill be okay.
I dont know.
I wish I was older.
Oh, adults dont know anything, Glen.


I dont really know how long    minutes is.
Of course, dear.
Don, I hope Im not bothering you.
I just wanted to let you knowI took Ducks talk very seriously.
And without having to crack my Deerfield yearbook,
Ive brought in an account.
Good for you.
Its a piece of Vicks Chemical Company.
Clearasil.
Better potential
than any traditional pharmaceutical, I believe.
Thats a real account, Campbell.
Howd that happen?
Im not embarrassed to say
my father-in-laws a former salesman, now executive there.
Thats generous.
Hes interested in my future.
Congratulations.
Im sure, with a little bit of lawyering,youre entitled to that bonus.
I got the bonus.
And Cooper gave me some book by Ayn Rand.
He seemed assured, as I hope you are,
that I have a significant investment in this company.
Well, you do now, dont you?
It matters to me that youre impressed.
I am.
Self-worth and status.
You said it.
Thanksgiving.
Its very n-nerve-wracking,
having to deal with getting the family together.
My m... My mother didnt...
cook last year because she was so sick.
And now Im going to have to deal with Gloria.
But it is Thanksgiving, and...
Im grateful for things.
Like this.
This has helped.
Don doesnt think so, but it has.
Being able to talk.
Just... Just me and you and your little pad.
It has helped.
Still, I...
I cant help but think that I would be happy
if my husband was faithful to me.
My brothers children are very badly behaved, and...
he spanks them.
Don has never laid a hand on the kids.
Hes kind inside.
But outside, it...
its all there in my face every day.
The hotel rooms.
Sometimes perfume...
or worse.
He doesnt know what family is.
He doesnt even have one.
It makes me sorry for him...
when in fact I...
I should be angry...
very angry, you know?
But I put up with it, like some ostrich.
Its interesting, isnt it?
The way he m...
he makes love...
sometimes its what I want.
But sometimes its obviously what someone else wants.
I suppose it means Im not enough.
But maybe it...
its just him.
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,
this is Joe Harriman and Lynn Taylor.
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.
Theyre all back in the lab.
Its a wonderful facility, but they dont take vacations.
What do they show, slides of them working?
So have you figured out a way to work the wheel into it?
We know its hard
because wheels arent really seen as exciting technology,
even though they are the original.
Well, technology is a glittering lure,
but theres the rare occasion
when the public can be engaged on the level beyond flash,
if they have a sentimental bond with the product.
My first job, I was in house at a fur company
with this old pro copyrighter, a Greek named Teddy.
And Teddy told me the mostimportant idea in advertising is "new."
Creates an itch.
You simply put your product in there
as a kind of... calamine lotion.
He also talked about a deeper bond with the product.
Nostalgia.
Its delicate...
but potent.
Sweetheart.
Teddy told me that in Greek,
nostalgia literally means the pain from an old wound.
Its a twinge in your heart
far more powerful than memory alone.
This device...
isnt a space ship.
Its a time machine.
It goes backwards, forwards.
It takes us to a place where we ache to go again.
Its not called the Wheel.
Its called the Carousel.
It lets us travel the way a child travels.
Around and around and back home again...
to a place where we know we are loved.
Good luck at your next meeting.
Don, I have to warn you, Im not alone.
It was beautiful.
Congratulations, mein Kommandant.
They called from the lobby.
They cancelled their other meetings, including DDB.
Not just a victory for us.
Its a victory for civilization.
Theres also more celebrating.
Mr. Campbell, here, your father-in-law called.
Hell be in before Christmas.
Ive got to get married.
No, thank you. Im good.
Heres how.
- Cheers.- Cheers.
You know what, Pete?
Ive got a way for you to turn this account into a home run.
Hes on a roll.
Clearasil.
You know who buys that?
Young girls.
What a difference it makes in their livesto be blemish-free.
I believe it does.
We have the perfect writer for that.
Peggy Olsen.
Thats funny.
Freddy Rumsen and I were bothvery impressed with her insight.
Freddy Rumsen.
- If I can weigh in...- No.
Come on. That Belle Jolie thing.
Plus you should have seen her in that booth yesterday.
She was like Kinsey but with balls.
Stop joking already, will you, Don?
Excuse me?
This is my father-in-law.
Hes expecting the very best.
Im expecting the very best,
not some little girl wholl walk away.
Youll have to give back that copy of Ayn Rand.
Do you know how hard I worked to get this account?
Who the hell is she?
Peggy is not even a copywriter.
Shes a... a secretary.
Peggy!
Yes, Mr. Draper?
Miss Olsen, you are now a junior copywriter.
Your first account will be deliveringClearasil to the spotted masses.
What?
Dont act surprised.
Is this really happening?
Yes, it is.
My goodness.
I will do my sincere best.
Good to hear.
Mr. Campbell, here, will brief you after the holiday.
Of course.
Thatll be all.
Thank you, Mr. Draper.
I said congratulations, didnt I?
Although sometimes when people get what they want,
they realize how limited their goals were.
So I guess Ill put you in with Victor Manning.
David Steuben got fired.
Fired?
People hated his work.
Will I get business cards?
Please make all your requests through Bridget.
Of course.
Peggy, I know you a little.
Remember, just because you now have a door,
dont forget that once you didnt.
Think of the other girls, or they wont think of you.
Vic Manning, Id like you to meet Peggy Olsen.
Shell be taking Mr. Steubens desk.
Nice to meet you.
I dont feel so swell.
I think I should go home.
I have to stop eating off the cart.
If youre trying to find a way to go out and celebrate,
you should ask your secretary to cover for you.
Very funny.
Happy Thanksgiving.
You, too, Joan.
David and I had a deal.
No meetings in here, okay?
And no music.
What can we do for you today?
My stomach hurts really bad.
I think I had a bad sandwich.
Lets take a look.
Oh, my God.
Honey, you didnt mention that you were expecting.
What?
Youre going to be a mother.
Thats impossible.
You want us to call your husband or your boyfriend?
I dont understand.
Stop talking.
Now listen, were going to get you up to Maternity.
No. No, thats not possible.
Do you feel that?
My God!
We need a wheelchair.
It hurts!
Its going to be okay, all right?
We just want you to calm down.
You dont understand.
We need a wheelchair!
Call Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry.
Oh.
Hello, darling.
Oh, were they having a party at the office?
Yes.
I think I should...
lie down.
Thats a good idea.
Sure. Rest up.
But make sure youre awake later.
Daddy!
Would you like to try to feed him?
Dont you want to hold him, sweetheart?
Hello?
Don?
What are you doing here?
Daddy! Are you coming with us?
No, he isnt. Daddy has to work.
But you can drive us to the station.
I havent called the taxi yet.
Im coming with you.
Really?
You are?
Ill pack the car.
Well be there before midnight.
Daddys coming with you.
- Daddy!- Daddy!
Oh, my goodness.
Hello?
Hello.
