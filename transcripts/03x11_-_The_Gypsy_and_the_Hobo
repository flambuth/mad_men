Sally! Bobby!
They sell it at Woolworths.
Theres a section that says"Halloween costumes. "
Youll wear it once.Plus, its made out of plastic and its crap.
- Im always gonna love Minnie Mouse.- Im gonna be an astronaut.
Didnt you hear me?The luggage.
- Ill go get it.- Thats not the point. They dont listen.
Theres more? Its a week.
Were going for a week?Are we gonna miss Halloween?
They have Halloween there.Youll go with your cousins.
Say goodbye to your father,then get the bags.
They have a Woolworths in Philly, too.
- I only have $40.- Swing by the bank.
There should be at least $200in your checking. Thats plenty.
You have no more money?
Take care.
Roger, I think you remember...
- Annabelle.- You look wonderful.
You look exactly the same.
- This is Annabelle... What is it again?- Mathis.
I cant tell if you twoknow each other or not.
- Don Draper.- Hello.
Please, Mrs. Mathis, sit.
How the hell were you in townand not look me up?
I wasnt sure about coming back here.Im running the company now.
- You divorced whats-his-name?- No, David died,
and because of my fathers will,the company went back to me.
- Im sorry.- Fifty-one years old. Lung cancer.
Thats too bad.
- So...- So, yes, if youre open to it.
Caldecott Farms, Im sure youve heard,
had a public relations crisisfollowed by disastrous sales.
- I hadnt heard.- The Misfits, the movie. Clark Gable.
It was about horsesbeing turned into dog food.
- There was an expos?.- We were singled out. I dont know why.
You dont know why? She ownsa horse farm that makes dog food.
We had a 15% share of the market,
but now Benton & Bowleshas dropped us for Gravy Train.
Well, that was a mistake.
People eat cow but they call it beef.Chicken is poultry.
- Pig...- We got it, sweetheart.
Well, there is no other word for horse meat.I thought maybe you could invent one.
- What do you think, Don?- I think its a tall order.
- Do you have to use horse meat?- All dog food is horse meat.
People eat it all over the world.Ive eaten it. Its delicious.
- Its like venison.- Ive eaten it.
Well, Ill tell youwhat Im telling the Avenue.
- Best idea gets my business.- How long do we have?
Im in town until Friday,but only the big firms are rushing.
Well, Im not gonna sit hereand brag about how big I am.
Roger.
Bert, I have two simple rules.
I dont want to change the recipe.Its all meat.
And two,my father named it Caldecott Farms.
Dont change the name.Dont change the product.
- Got it.- Walk me out?
We had their business before,but her father was a son of a bitch.
You know, people spend more moneyon dog food than baby food.
Ill put the fellas on it.
- Is that really necessary?- Youve never walked in high heels.
No, coming in here.What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you,and I need something new.
- Ill bet you do.- For my business.
Besides, youre married, arent you?
- I am.- Still or again?
- You know its again. Dont get cute.- I heard shes a teenager.
Probably too jealous to let youhave a business dinner with me.
- Gonna need a reason.- Because I know youre good at this.
Advertising, I mean.
- Tomorrow night. Somewhere French.- Avec plaisir.
All the lights were on.I figured youd be home.
I knew you were coming over.Thought it might be dark when I got home
and I didnt want the Mckaysto see you turning on the lights.
Thats very thoughtful.
Im making spaghetti with creamand butter and cheese.
- And hot pepper?- Yes.
I had it like that in Little Italy.I love that place.
Believe it or not,I get treated very well there.
I wish I could take you there.
I know.
Don, I swear Im not talkingabout our future.
- I entered into this with my eyes open.- I pushed you.
What does it matter?
Here we are, and I look at your life,
and even if I remove myselffrom the picture,
I see a man who is not happy.
Im happy now.
What?
Okay.
Okay.
Im going to lie down.Come get me when you want to.
Why did I decide to leave surgery?These last few months have been difficult,
but I found a reserve of strength in myselfI didnt know I had,
and I realized there are other waysto heal people besides cutting them open.
What experiencehave you had with psychiatry?
- Thats kind of personal.- Greg, remember what Steve said.
This is a field aboutthe most intimate details in life.
More intimate than their organs?
You know, Im curiouswhy you wont answer the question.
What is your experience with psychiatry?
None personally,but my dad had a nervous breakdown.
- I didnt know that.- Yeah, no one was buying furniture.
My mom ran away for two weeksbecause he wouldnt get a Christmas tree.
A headshrinker got him through,but we werent allowed to talk about it.
Greg, thats wonderful.
- It was a lot of things, Joanie.- No.
Answer like that.This is a talking profession.
The way you just were with me right now,so open, hes gonna love you.
The most important thingabout an interview
is to express enthusiasmin a believable way.
No self-deprecating humor.
Youre smart. Youre funny.Youre great to be around,
but you havent decidedif theyre the right one.
- This isnt a beauty pageant.- Well, Ive seen executives crash and burn.
I cant believe I never told you that.
I just
wanted more than I thought I would want.
But itll pass.
Actually, I know for a fact it will.
I dont want it to pass.
One day I dropped the kids off at schooland I saw you in the yard.
I kept wishing you could get in the carand drive away with me.
Just let it go.
Ill clear my schedule. We can go to Mysticor something for the rest of the week.
Mystic?
- I can think of someplace if youre serious.- I am.
Okay.
Damn it.
- Hello?- Roger, its Joan.
- Joan Harris.- Jesus.
Youre lucky I answered. Gingers not in.
I know. She has a hair appointmentthe last Tuesday of every month.
- She does?- And I know that your lunch canceled.
What am I wearing?
So, how are things?
Mr. Hooker has rearrangedthe secretaries in the pool
- alphabetically.- By cup size?
- Well, I know where youd be sitting.- Youre making me sorry I called you.
I need a favor. I need help finding work.
- Something happen with Dr. Cut-Up?- Not at all.
Hes pursuing his dreamof becoming a psychiatrist,
but that means more training and I justdont want him moonlighting all the time.
- Why does it matter?- It doesnt. None of my business.
- Why dont you come back here?- Roger, Ive been replaced,
and a secretary makes less moneythan if I was working at a department store.
Im so glad you called me.
- Im sorry it had to be for a favor.- No.
I like that you thought of me.You know, to ask.
You want to be on some peoples minds.Some peoples you dont.
- Thats nice.- So, do you miss it here?
Are you asking if I miss you?
Well, I guess I am,because everything else is different.
- I should go.- Well, how do I work this?
If I think of anybody.Just give them your number?
Look at you,figuring things out for yourself.
Bye-bye, Joanie.
Look whos here.
Im sorry I missed the funeral.My grandson was graduating.
It was beautiful.
Judy fixed lunch.We dont have to talk right away.
I dont have a lot of time.
Betty wants to knowwhat the house is worth.
- Im a lawyer. Im not a real estate agent.- Well, the house was left to both of us,
and I dont understand why I shouldntbe able to buy it away from her
- at double what Dad paid for it.- They bought it in the late 20s.
Dad always saidit was the top of the market.
Your father intended youto get as much money for it as you could,
if you were going to sell it.
Otherwise, somebodyhas to buy somebody out.
So, basically Dad gave it to Bettybecause he knew I didnt have any money.
This is ugly. You know that?
Milton, I need to speak to youin confidence.
I need your advice.I need complete confidentiality.
Its my husband.
I just found out some compromising facts.
Hes been married before, and he...
Well, its not even his real name,and he bought her a house, his ex-wife.
I need to know what to do.
I dont know him, Betsy.I met him at your wedding.
I know your father didnt want himin the will.
- So?- What do you want to do?
You want a divorce? In New York state,you need to prove adultery. Can you?
- Maybe.- I mean prove it in a court of law.
Thats hard to do. Unless he wants out,but youre not gonna get anything.
You wont even be ableto buy William out of the house.
Youll have to sell it.
And he can take the children.
Thats my legal advice.You want the rest of it?
- Are you afraid of him?- No.
Is he a good provider?
He is, but thats not the point.
Its a lie so big, Milton.
I feel like Ive been in some dreamsince I found out.
Just saying it out loud to you...This is the first time
Im realizing its true.
You have three small children together.
At least go home, give it a try.
Thats what Id tell my own daughter.
Damn it, Betts! This isnt right!
- Look, he waited.- This is number three.
What do you want?
Im going to have one of those lovely wines.
Why did you have two? Are you nervous?
- Shell have one of those lovely wines.- Bordeaux.
Don wants to call ina focus group right away.
Thats enough business.
I want to know everything thats happenedin the last 20 years.
Longer.
It wasnt until years later that I realized
you were the only personI could remember that time with.
What do you want to remember?
What I was like at that age.Paris before the w*r.
Eating in cemeteries.
People were jumping out of windowsand we were on vacation.
I dont remember much.
Are you trying to tell mewhen you saw Casablanca
- you didnt think about me?- You mean Peter Lorre?
You seemed so happy to see me,and now youre just being drunk.
Look, Annabelle.We were not in Casablanca.
The only similarityis that you left me for another man.
When she gets on the plane at the end?
That woman got on the plane with a manwho was going to end World w*r II,
not run her fathers dog food company.
You were adrift.You didnt do anything but spend money.
You walked around like you were hopingto be a character in somebody elses novel.
The boxing.
Im not gonna sit hereand listen to your reasons.
Believe it or not, I still remember them.
Jesus, wheres the wine?I dont like the way youre looking at me.
- How am I looking at you?- With pity.
I finally found a beautiful, carefree girl,unconcerned about the future.
- I was more serious than you.- Well, I got mine.
I married Mona, joined the firm,
and then I got shipped offto the Pacific for the duration.
And when I came home, I went to workwhile you were watching Casablanca,
and I got blamed when we lost the account.
All I heard was my father saidBert Cooper had a screw loose.
Look, youre rich.
Let someone else take your horse meatand slap their label on it.
And do what?
- I dont want a whole bottle.- Ill help.
And I told himthe closest we ever got to Hemingway
was sitting in a chair he once sat in.And that was the 20s, not the 30s.
And then he said he remembered mebecause I was the one
- whod introduced him to peanut butter.- Yeah, I never understood that.
They had peanuts in Europe.No one ever thought of that?
- Look at us.- Will you stop?
Roger, do I look like a widow?
You look great.
You still want me.
So what?
Im married.
Newlywed, honeymooning.
How could I have missed the windowbetween Mona and her?
There really wasnt much of a window.
- Kind of overlapped.- I was there first.
Well just take this and tack it onto that.
Im gonna get you a cab.
Are you afraid Ill be disappointed?You were always good drunk.
Annabelle, let me get you a cab.
Its different with this girl.
Im sorry.
Good night.
Howd it go?
I screwed up all my answersand I tried to talk about the articles,
but I couldnt remember anything.I made a fool out of myself.
- I am sure thats not true.- You werent there.
Stop acting like you know everything.
- Youll have other interviews.- I dont want them.
I dont want to be a psychiatrist.Its not medicine.
I might as well work at a bank.
I dont care what you do,as long as you do something.
We need money.
I did everything I was supposed to do.Everything they told me.
College, med school.
I wanted to be a surgeonsince I was that big.
Im sorry, Greg.
- Maybe its time to move on.- You dont know!
You dont know what its liketo want something your whole life,
and to plan for it,and to count on it and not get it! Okay?
Holy shit!
What the hell?Youre insane, you know that?
Why isnt he wearing a white coat?He looks like a dog food salesman.
Dogs dont like uniforms.
Well, were lucky.Everyone has an appetite today.
They said we should bring them hungry,but he does seem to like this.
How would you describeyour dogs temperament?
Shes picky, and shes nervous sometimes,
- but shes very smart.- And yours?
Hes independent, you know?
He knows what he likes.Hes pretty hard to fool.
- My God, theyre describing themselves.- This your first group?
What if I told you your dogswere enjoying Caldecott Farms?
- Whats it called?- I wouldnt like it.
- Bingo, stop.- Ive never heard of it.
Well, you should.They make it out of ponies.
Goodness gracious, thats this one?
This is the first Im hearing of this.I wish you wouldve told me.
- When people are protesting, Im onboard.- Well, what brand does your dog prefer?
- Why would you do this to us?- Its inhumane.
- Bingo looks sick.- Turn it off.
- Would you prefer beef...- Could somebody get that?
- I cant turn it off. Its actually happening.- Turn off the sound.
I already know how people feel.Its your job to change that.
Any agency that does not change the nameis stealing your money.
The product is good.Its high quality, dogs love it,
- but the name has been poisoned.- That name got us where we are.
- Do you think that was just luck?- Im not saying a new name is easy to find,
and we will give you a lot of options,but its a label on a can.
And it will be true, because it will promisethe quality of the product thats inside.
Well, Im gonna wait it out,
and not for these morons,but for another agency
- to solve my problem.- Jesus, Annabelle, let it go.
The name is done. Its unfair, but its over.
- Annabelle!- Are you ready for the next group?
- I dont like the way youre speaking to me.- Everybody out.
- Is this about last night?- I dont even remember last night.
Well, you threw yourself at meand I turned you down.
Im right. You want to hurt me.
No. No, I dont.
You want to know if it was a great time?It was.
Do you want to knowif you broke my heart? Obviously.
Well, it was a mistake.
Its nice to hear,but it doesnt matter anymore.
It does to me.
When I was burying this man,
all I thought was, Id have ratherhad my heart broken every day by you.
You were the one.
You werent.
Well, youre lucky you found her.
Goodbye, Roger.
I think its about four hours to Norwich,but the Norwich Inn might be a little past it,
and we can check in till midnight.Well be fine.
Ill be right out.


Daddy?
- Ill be right back, Salamander.- Daddy!
- I left my hat in the car.- Get it later.
I need to talk to you.
- Go upstairs.- We want to say hi to Daddy.
Upstairs.
Youre home early.What did William do now?
Not right now, Don.
Why didnt you just call the office?
I came home to feed the dogand change shirts.
- I have a client dinner in the city.- I need to show you something.
- Whats going on?- Open this drawer.
Betts, thats my desk.
Open the drawer or I will.
Fine.
Betty, this is my desk. Its private.
Where did you get these?
You left them in the pocketof your bathrobe,
but I could have had a locksmithin here anytime I wanted.
I respected your privacy too long. Open it.
No.
You know I know whats in there.
I can explain.
You didnt have to look at my things.
Which things, Don?
The pictures coveredwith other peoples names?
Is that you? Dick? Is that your name?
People change their names, Betts.
- You did.- I did. I took your name.
And so did this Anna woman,whoever she is.
- I can explain.- I know. I know you can.
Youre a very, very gifted storyteller.
Betts, I...
I need a drink.
Are you thinking of what to sayor are you just looking at that door?
Im not going anywhere.
Ill get you a drink. Just sit down.
You bought her a house.
Where do you want me to start?
- Whats your name?- Donald Draper.
- But it used to be Dick Whitman.- And whos that woman? Your other wife.
It wasnt romantic.
I ended up married to herbecause I ran away to join the army.
There was an accident,
and this guy was k*ll and I was injured.
But they made a mistake.
And all I had to do was be himand I could leave Korea.
Be who?
- Donald Draper.- You took his name?
Yes.
Isnt that against the law?
Yes.
I found out it was easier to be him
than to start over.
And it turned out he was marriedto that woman, so I took care of her.
And then I divorced herthe minute I met you.
You divorced her on Valentines Day, 1953,
three months before we got married.Why didnt you tell me?
- Why couldnt you tell me any of this?- When? The day we met?
On our first date? On our wedding night?
- Why did you need to know?- You dont get to ask any questions.
You have a family.
No, I dont.
All this time I thought you weresome football hero who hated his father.
I knew you were poor.I knew you were ashamed of it.
And I see how you are with money.You dont understand it.
I was very poor.
Did you see herwhen you were in California?
I did.
And she reminded me that I loved you.
What would you do if you were me?
- Would you love you?- I was surprised that you ever loved me.
Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- I dont know.- You obviously wanted me to know this
or you wouldnt have left your keys, youwouldnt have kept all of this in my house.
Say something.
I didnt think I had a choice.
And I dont know what the difference is.
This is our house.
- Those are our children.- Well, theres a big difference.
You lied to me every day.
I cant trust you. I dont know who you are.
Yes, you do.
Were not done.
Betts, Im in here.
- How is he?- He kicked his blankets off.
Sit with me.
This was my father, Archibald.
But this...
Thats not my mother.
My mother was a 22-year-old prostitutewho died having me.
This woman,
Abigail, Archies wife.
She raised me.
When I was 10,
Arch died and we moved.
And Abigail
took up with him.
Mack.
Uncle Mack.
He was nice to me.
What happened to them?
Theyre all dead.
Even Adam?
The little boy in all the pictures.I assume hes your brother.
He was my half-brother.
And he died.
He k*ll himself.
He came to me because he wanted help,
and I turned him away.
He didnt even want help, he just...
He just wanted to be a part of my life.
And I couldnt risk all of this.
He hung himself.
Im sorry. I am.
Bob, how are you?Listen, Ive got a favor to ask you.
I know this girl. Actually, you met her once.
Joan Holloway. Well, Harris. Redhead?
Yes, shes beautiful.
Anyway, shes expensive,but youre always complaining
about needing someoneto whip your place into shape,
so think about it.
I want to help her out.Shes important to me.
Janes fine. Thanks for asking.
Dont be a stranger.
Im sorry, Joanie.
And Im gonna buy you another vaseto put those in.
- Im gonna buy you a lot of things.- Its not about buying things.
I know, I know, but Ive been an ass,
feeling sorry for myselfbecause I couldnt solve this problem.
And it was so easy, Joanie.The answer was right in front of me.
I joined the army, Joanie.
Youre gonna be taken care of.Were gonna be taken care of.
And the best part is, I get to be a surgeon.They need them.
- You joined the army?- I know I shouldve asked you,
but Ill do six weeks of basic training.Thats it.
Ill do my residency in New York.
- And then what?- And then I might have to go somewhere.
West Germany, maybe Vietnam,if thats still going on,
but a lot of docs dont have to go anywhere,especially if they have families.
And Ill go in as a captain.You know what that means?
You dont have to work anymore.
- I dont know what to say.- Joanie, please tell me
this will make you happy,because it will make me happy
to give you everything you want.
Its wonderful, Greg.
And no more soup.Get your coat. Were going out.
- We should.- Thats my girl.
Do you want something?
Are you gonna have something?
- Daddy, are you going to trick or treat?- Yes, of course.
Ill see you tonight.
- I didnt think you were coming in today.- I canceled my plans.
Do you want me to reschedule your lunchwith Jeff Stansbury at United Fruit?
No, I have plenty to do.
- Hello?- I stopped by earlier.
- No one answered.- I was running all morning.
- About last night...- What happened? Did you get caught?
Its more complicated than that.
So, I suppose Im not goingto see you anymore?
Not right now. No.
Are you okay?
Only you would ask about me right now.
Do I have to worry about my job?
No.
Okay.
I should go.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Suzanne.
- Hes home! Lets go!- Youll wake the baby.
- Do I look like a gypsy?- Yes.
Lets go, lets go!
- Do you want anything?- No.
Should I take the carriage or just carry him?
Its cold out there.
You can stay here with him or I can.
No.
Good.
Whats taking so long?
- Trick or treat!- Trick or treat!
Well, hello there. Look at this.
Weve got a gypsy and a hobo.
And who are you supposed to be?
