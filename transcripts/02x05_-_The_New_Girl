Mr. And Mrs. Campbell,
Im Dr. Stone.
And how are we today?
Were so pleased to be here.
My friend, Sara Driscoll,
her father is head of Obstetricsat Lenox Hill.
She said you get results.
They got results.
Sometimes all a young couple needsis a good old-fashioned hand-holding.
Have a seat, Mr. Campbell.
Now, I am going to ask yousome questions together
and more intimate ones separately.
How long have you beentrying to conceive?
Eighteen months.
That sounds like a long time. Is it?
Lets not worry about whats normal.
Everyone is different.
Are you two awareof the principles of conception?
Of how the sperm meets the egg?
Yes.
Although if youd liketo show us some films...
Youd be surprised.
Prior to the decision to conceive,were you using birth control?
- She was.- I used a diaphragm.
Although its possible I didnt need to.
Mrs. Campbell.
So were walking in the park after lunch,
and he sees these birdspicking seeds out of some horse shit,
and he says, "Move over, fellows.Thats my job."
That sounds like a visitfrom the stork or De Beers.
Or it could be just a new hairdo.
Mr. Rumsen, Mr. Draper.
How are you this morning?
Joan. Morning.
Well, theres your answer.
- Ever had mumps?- Yes.
How old were you?
Summer of 45...
11, 12.
Did your testicles descend normally?
Absolutely.
And have you ever fathered a child?
No.
Have you ever had difficultycompleting the sexual act?
Drinking doesnt help.
But no.
I always reach home base.
Do you have difficulties with arousal?
Jesus.
Im a red-blooded American male, okay?
No one is questioningyour manhood, Mr. Campbell.
You could be a warrior,
an athlete, a bull of a man.
George Washington was sterile.
Fertility has nothing to do with manliness.
Do you want to have a child?
What kind of question is that?
Of course I do.
What man doesnt want a child?
Although you thinkabout the world right now.
The b*mb...
Do you worry about the world?
Occasionally.
Do you work with X-rays,radioactive material,
or toxic chemicals?
Im in advertising.
We got a Xerox machine,but I dont use it.
Not personally.
Advertising?
Must be a lot of fun.
Are you kidding?
Im an account man.
I spend half my day tiptoeingaround creative crybabies
and the other half drinkingwith ungrateful turnips
who just fell off the truck.
Im completely replaceable,
even though I just brought ina huge account.
Then you throw this baby thingon top of it,
the economy contracting, my in-laws...
Yes, its a lot.
What about your parents?
My father just passed away.
Im sorry to hear that.
Do you think that hassomething to do with this?
It doesnt.
I mean...
I try not to think about it.
Its been a few months.
It is a difficult moment in the life cycle.
But we are partof a continuum, arent we?
So maybe Im the end of the line.
Well, thatll do it, Mr. Campbell.
I think I feel better already.
Can you send in your wife?
And then Id like youto schedule a time with a nurse
for a semen analysis.
Whenever shes free.
Red and green are my colors,so were gonna do Christmas.
He doesnt know that yet.
I can cover Mr. Drapers desk for you.
I know youll have your hands full.
You had your sh*t.
Its beautiful.
Miss Holloway,those arent wedding bells.
Im so sorry, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Drapers office.
One moment, please.
Mr. Draper, Bobbie Barrett on line 1.
Thank you.
Don, I want you to ask me how I am.
How are you?
Where are you right now?
Im in my office,
where you called me.
You sound a little tipsy.
We did it.
We sold Grin and Barrett.
Congratulations. You got an order?
No, but were going to make a pilot.
I remember that because Jimmy said,
"Ask her. Shes madeevery pilot in town."
Come celebrate with me.
Im at Sardis, surrounded by clowns.
And why would I come?
Im being ignored.Come take up my time.
Im working.
You provided key advice.
We can call it business.
No. Lets not confuse this.
Im about to change my mind.
Thank you.
Was there even a party?
Hell have an old fashioned.
Buddy Hackett told Jimmy
that Gleason didnt have to make a pilot,
so Jimmy went home to sulk,
and the rest went outto celebrate that they ruined his day.
So here we are.
I expect him to get this waywhen its bad,
but when its good?
Maybe he doesnt understandhow big this is.
No, he does.
Its the big opportunityhes bound to ruin.
Mr. Draper.
Miss Menken.
Actually, its Mrs. Katz.
- This is my husband Tilden.- Pleasure.
Mr. Drapers firm did some workfor us a while back.
Advertising.
Im Bobbie Barrett.
Im sorry.
Mrs. Barretts husbandis a comedian who works with me.
Nice to meet you.
Tilden. I love comedians.
So, how are things at Grey?
Are they still taking creditfor everything we did?
Hes all business, isnt he?
Now, Rach, we dontwant to miss the curtain.
We have seats forA Funny Thing Happened.
Oh, its wonderful.
Well, you two enjoy working together.
Nice to meet you.
So, I would like some really good chow.
Shall we go elsewhere?
We can.
Does feel a little cloudy in here right now.
No, its fine.
So, tell me what I want.
Steak tartare.
Oh, my God, youre good.
Hearts of palm salad. Steak tartare.
I always order for Jimmy.
Watch the money.
Otherwise he ends upsporting for people we dont know.
He doesnt realize that being a big sh*tmeans you dont have to pay.
I think youre wrong about that.
In the end, werein different businesses, okay?
To a nice price on the pilot.
And I boxed them in for 39on the air if they order.
You should have seen my neckline.
You really do his business, dont you?
If it wasnt for me,it wouldnt be Grin and Barrett.
Itd be Grin and Brownstein.
This is America.
Pick a job and then becomethe person that does it.
Well, thats true.
Right after I met Jimmy,
I watched somebodys Uncle Morty
close a deal for him,
and I realizedI negotiate for everything...
the rent, the plumber, my hairdresser.
I even did it in a department store once.
Its touchy becauseyoure really telling somebody
theyre not worth what they think.
But you cant hurt their feelings.
Negotiating is a bore.
Its hand-to-hand combat.
You dont like negotiating.
What the hell do you like?
What do you mean?
Doesnt have to be in business.
Ill take anything.
You cant even answer.
The answer is huge.
I dont think so.
Do you like the ocean?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I have a little place in Stony Brook,right on the shore.
I want to have you on the beach.
Feel the cold sand on my backwith the surf pounding behind us.
I can smell the ocean.
I love bridges.
I dont know if its the drop
or just becauseyou get to see something
disappearing behind you.
Do you like bridges?
I do.
Thats two things you like.
What else?
Movies.
Yes. Spartacus?
You seen the foreign ones?
So sexy.
Yes.
Why is it so hard to just enjoy things?
God, I feel so good.
I dont feel a thing.
You all right?
Yeah.
I think so.
Are you okay in there?
Mr. Draper, your wife saysthat the whiskey was hers.
But you did fail the sobriety test.
Youre at the legal limit...
. 15 percent.
The fines $150.
May I?
I have $63 and some subway tokens.
Ill mail you the rest.
I need you to pay the fine tonight.
Or I can put you up.
Let me call a cab,and Ill send an employee
out here with the $500tomorrow morning.
I bet you would, too.
No, its just 150.
Its within my rights to detain you.
What is the problem?
Peoples kids are out on that road, sir.
Call somebody.
Or maybe your wife has a friend.
I have $110.
Its all I could get short notice.
If youre going to be sick,please tell me.
This is my brother-in-laws car.
I put $2.00 worth of gas in it.
I dont want to have to clean it, too.
Mr. Draper, I thinkyou should keep her awake.
Bobbie, stay up!
What?
What do you think?
Are you feeling okay?
You can drop me off at Grand Central.
Bobbie, what do you want to do?
Jimmy cant see me this way.
I should check in somewhere,
see how the shiner does.
Peggy, do you have a roommate?
No.
I dont know.
No, you should stay with me.
Just for the night, if you want.
Mr. Draper, you need to rent a car.
I can take you to LaGuardia.
Idlewild is better.
The Cross Island or the Belt Parkway.
Its faster to take the Grand Centralto LaGuardia.
I dont have any clothes.
I wish I was your size.
Do you have any dry cleaning?
Ill pick it up.
In the city.
Ill go in and get it first thing.
Okay?
Hello.
Leave her alone.
No one in the office can know about this.
Its business.
Youll have to believe methat Ill forget this.
I dont want you treating me badlybecause I remind you of it.
This can be fixed.
Where the hell were you?
I was in an accident.
What? Are you okay?
What happened?
By the time I could call,I didnt want to wake you.
Wake...
Wake me?
Ive been awake all night.
I knew something was wrong.
I could feel it.
I went to the doctor a while ago,and I have high bl*od pressure.
What the hell, Don?
Its fine, except...
he gave me a prescription,
and I think the pillsmixed with the drinks was too much.
I lost control of the car.
Jesus. How could younot tell me about this?
I didnt want to worry you.
Ive been up all night.
And now I find out youre sickand you could have died?
What did you want me to do?
Have you come down there?
Ask Francine in the middle of the nightto watch the kids
because your husbandsin the drunk t*nk?
Who cares if I couldnt help you?
You should call me.
Im your wife.
I was solving a problem, Bets.
I need a clear head.
You cant get all hysterical.
I didnt know you were waiting up.
You promised you wouldntdisappear like that anymore.
I have to get changed and go in.
Youre going to the office?
I dont want anyone to know about this.
I rented a car. Ill have to get my car.
I dont care about the car, Don.
My father has high bl*od pressure.
Ill swing by Dr. McLattery on the way in.
Just help me get dressed, okay?
You can fend without me.
Im at a fat farm.
One of your friendsmade a crack about my ass.
It doesnt matter who.
Well, were gonna beall over the television,
and the camera adds 10 pounds.
No. You look fine.
Jimmy, stop.
You and I both know
you should have behavedyourself last night.
I will.
I couldnt find an ashtray.
Whats all this?
I thought you might be hungry.
Itll ruin my alibi.
I need cottage cheese and champagne.
Im joking.
Do you mind if I lay downfor a few minutes?
Im not used to being up all night.
Of course, dear.
And I got this to keep me company.
Ill make up the couch for you.
You must be b*at, too.
Ill make it.
- Where are the linens?- Just a minute.
Oh, Marilyn.
The tragedy you live.
Im sure glad I dont have problems.
I think most womenwould love to have her problems.
Somebody said shes gonnabe at the fundraiser
at the Garden on Saturday night.
You know, the presidents birthday?
I really dont want to miss it.
Do you have a headache?
Because we had a little boyin our neighborhood
who fell off a swing set and hit his head
and went to sleep.
And then he died.
Well, its certainlygood to have company.
Im sorry. I shouldnt talk that way.
I keep forgetting the accident.
It was terrible.
And it keeps getting stranger.
If youre lucky, it will disappear.
I have to lie down.
Are you his secretary?
No, but we work together.
Well both be handlingMr. Draper for the time being.
Now, youre a college girl,
so Im going to expect youto jump in with haste.
I have a lot of arrangementsto make for my wedding.
Oh, my goodness. Congratulations.
Hes a doctor. He doesnt work here,
so dont worry about puttingyour foot in your mouth.
Lucky you.
Let me see?
Its so lively.
Youd like to think it doesnt matter.
Ive been offered a few,and this is by far the best.
Im a little bit clairvoyant,
and I think you two are goingto be very happy together.
I feel like Im walking in tall cotton.
Arent you darling?Youre gonna be gangbusters.
Mr. Draper is impatient.Do not let it intimidate you.
If it isnt the welcome wagon.
Hello there.

Paul Kinsey, copywriter.
Harry Crane, married.
Jane Siegel.
Anything I can helpyou gentlemen with?
I actually need to see Mr. Draper.
Is he in?

Mr. Draper.
Id like you to meet Jane, the new girl.
Morning.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Im gonna help you hold onto this one.
Im not paying attention anymoreuntil theyre here a month.
What happened to your wing?
I missed the bottom step.
Its an old house.
I got an urgent call from Jimmy Barrett.
He wants to come in.
Why?
He wouldnt say.
Was he upset about something?
Who can tell?
I want you to put him off a few days,
let him cool.
Hell make more sense.
Good idea.He probably wants a rubdown.
Paper says they ordered his pilot.
Friday.
Should I talk to your girl?
Ill handle it.
You bet.
Get the door.
Hello?
Is everything okay?
Yes, I think so.
Is she awake?
Shes fine.
Put her on.
Just a minute.
I didnt think youd call.
Why not?
I dont know. I just...
How are you?
I dont know.
Jimmy called.He wants to meet with me.
He does?
I called him, and everything went fine.
So you dont knowanything about this?
You think Id be in Brooklynif I didnt have to be?
I talked to him.Im covered. Believe me.
I do.
Are you okay?
I guess.
You?
Its going to be better.
Good.
Take care.
Do you want to play cards or something?
I think I have some.
No.
Im sorry, but its k*ll me.
Why are you doing this?
I dont know.
Hes my boss.
Quite an example hes setting.
Are you seeing him?
No.
So what, then?
Hes done a lot for me.
He made me a copywriter.
I bet you made yourself a copywriter.
All these books.
Hes a decent man, isnt he?
You wouldnt think he would be.
I never expect him to beany other way than what he is.
Well keep her here for another few weeks.
Shes still not in any conditionto make decisions for herself.
She should be at home.
Listen to the doctor, Mama.
In this kindof psychoneurotic disorder...
Hello, Ma.
Hello, dear.
Im afraid youll have to leave us alone.
Im going, but Im not leaving, Peaches.
Hello, Peggy.
How are you today?
I still feel so tired.
Do you know what year it is?
Its 1960.
Do you know who the president is?
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Good. Do you knowwhere you are, Peggy?
St. Marys.
Do you know why youre here?
No.
You know St. Marys is a hospital?
Yes.
Why do you think youre here?
I dont know.
I dont feel like myself.
Thats because we have youon medication.
We want you to be relaxedso you feel more like talking.
I told you what happened.
You had a baby.
You know, you can hear that outside.
Nobody knows what Im doing.
Its good for mystique.
So, Joanie, I hearcongratulations are in order.
Yes.
Marriage. Dont know why youd wantto join that club, baby.


Hasnt stopped youfrom having a good time.
How old is this guy?
Hes 34.
Whats wrong with him?
Nothing.
Well, I think its nice to hear the storyof relatively young love.
Are you being a concerned daddy?
Ill tell you the same thingI told my daughter.
If you put a penny in a jar
every time you make lovein the first year of marriage,
and then you takea penny out of the jar
every time you make lovein the second year,
you know what you have?
A jar full of pennies.
I envy that girl having youto give her away.
Ive always been faithfulto whomever I was with.
And despite your jokes,
I always assumed youwere unhappy with Mona,
not the whole idea.
You arent just another woman, Joanie.
Well, it doesnt matter now, does it?
I fell in love.
Makes me sad.
Just another reasonnot to come in to work.
Im not going anywhere.
Yes, you are.
Youll see.
Can I give you a couple paddlesfor good luck?
Coffee.
Thanks for buying milk.
I live alone. It always goes bad.
So this really must be a kick in the head.
Company is nice.
Your eyes improved.
Thats good.
I can cover the purplewith some green eye shadow.
Complementary colors. We use that.
Old trick.
I was a dancer.
I met a lot of interesting people.
You have a boyfriend?
No, I dont.
So, are you in love with him?
No.
Its not a ridiculous question.
Are you?
Its a personal question,
and Ive already answered you.
Youre right.
Arent you going to ask meif Im in love with him?
Its none of my business.
Youre right again.
Youre so young and beautiful.
Im not your competition.
Thats sweet.
Is there anything else I can get you?
No.
I love your place.
Ive been trying to fix it up.
Well, I like it. It takes me back.
Unless one of you needs helpfinding a dead client file,
I suggest you pitchyour tents elsewhere.
I see what youre doing,
and I have to say Im disappointed.
I dont follow.
Your d?colletage is distracting.
This is an office that hingeson professional decorum.
Im so sorry, Joan.
I didnt realize.
Better?
Go out and get a sweater at lunch.
Be reasonable.
Theres still plenty to see,and you know that.
Jane.
I have some very important talentcoming in tomorrow to see Don,
somebody famous,
and I just want to make sureyoure aware of that.
Whats your title here?
Title?
Im Ken.
Cosgrove.
Accounts.
Yes, youre here in the bookwith Jimmy Barrett.
Would you like to go see him sometime?
Hey. Listen to this.
Its Mozart.
You can use the mirror in the bedroom.
No.
Part of the process of learningto live without your hospitality.
Its nothing.
Not true.
I was curious if youre awareof the value of your service.
Its what youre supposed to do, isnt it?
I wouldnt say that.
People will take advantage of you.
I know what Im doing.
What do you want?
Are you just some busy little beebuilding a hive out in Brooklyn?
Are you still trying to say thank you?
You have to start living the lifeof the person you want to be.
Is that what you did?
Youre never going to get that corner office
until you starttreating Don as an equal.
And no one will tell you this,
but you cant be a man.
Dont even try.
Be a woman.
Its a powerful businesswhen done correctly.
Do you understandwhat Im saying, dear?
I think so.
How do I get to Grand Central from here,steam ship?
I can walk you to the train.
Its two blocks over.
Ill call a car.
Hello?
How was your day?
Spectacular.
Duck called Bert Peterson a mongoloid.
What a leader of men.
Dr. Stones office rang.
How is Dr. Stone?
I didnt ask, but the nurse saidthat your sample was quite viable.
Is that right?
Well. What do you know?
That is a relief, I do say.
Yes.
Able to leap tall buildingsin a single bound, are they?
I suppose.
To viability.
What? This is good.
It is.
This is what you wanted, isnt it?
No, youre right. Its a relief.
Now we know its me.
Right.
So Stone can blow up your ovariesor do whatever his cutting-edge plan is.
Peter, I cant believe you.
Wait a minute. You wanted to do this.
You had to know thiswas a possible outcome.
Get back here!
Trudy!
Sit down.
Im sorry.
I didnt think it through.
Thats honest.
I dont know what I thought.
Who says we have to do this?
Except for what,
its the next thing were supposed to do?
But it is. Its natural.
Says who?
I was having a great time.
Werent you?
Maybe this is the wayits supposed to be.
I mean, you have a baby.
You cant travel.
You cant go to the moviesunless you have help,
and thats expensive.
Youre immature, Peter, you know that?
I just did a very private thing
in a very public place for you.
And guess what.You dont like the results.
What do you want me to do?
Express some concern.
And stop talking abouthow youre going to miss
seeing Cape Fear for the third time.
I know one thing.
I sure as hell wouldnt want a kid herewatching this donnybrook.
Either you make it through this thing,
or you just keep it to yourself.
Im giving you that option.
Stop!
Im sorry.
Im just...
Its just I really do want a baby.
What is all this for?
I dont know.
Can we eat now?
Not here.
Get your coat.
Is that you?
Are you really there?
Yes, I am.
What are you doing here?
You got a promotion and disappeared.
Your Christmas presentis sitting on your desk.
I called your house,
and your roommate gave meyour mothers number.
Oh, God.
Your mother told me you were quarantined.
TB.
I guess that was supposedto lessen my concern.
Im sorry.
Whats wrong with you?
I dont know.
What do they want you to do?
I dont know.
Yes, you do.
Do it.
Do whatever they say.
Peggy, listen to me.
Get out of here and move forward.
This never happened.
It will shock youhow much it never happened.
Its old work, and weremeeting early next week.
The artwork is new.
Im going to see myfather-in-law this weekend,
and hes going to ask me.
Mr. Draper, Jimmy Barrettis going to be early.
Im sorry Im late.
Don was asking wherewere going with this.
I need more time. I was sick.
I did my work.
Should we bring someone else in?
Throw it at Kurt and Smitty?
I dont know. Miss Olson,do you need some help?
No. Ill have it first thing Monday.
Yes, you will.
Yes?
Mr. Draper, Im sorry I was unprepared.
Dont let it happen again.
Well, its... its just that...
What?
$110 is a lot of money for me.
Your bail.
Right.
Here.
Ill give you 50 tomorrow.
I guess when you tryto forget something,
you have to forget everything.
Thank you, Don.
Wow, Draper.
Some kind of tomato farm you got here.
Window dressings important.
Can I get you anything?
I was going to ask you the same thing.
Blondie, wait outside.
Jimmy, Mrs. Barrett, you look good.
You dont. What happenedto the flipper there?
Old football injury.
Yeah. I get those, too.
Have a seat.
No need. Ill keep this short.
I just want to thank youfor convincing the folks at Utz
to let me do the show.
- My pleasure.- Yeah.
We all got what we wanted, didnt we?
What Im trying to say is,the way I behaved,
I wouldnt have been surprisedif you would have, you know,
looked the other wayon this thing, blocked it up.
Why would I do that?
This guy.
I cant tell if hes being smug or not.
I just wanted you to knowthat Im not a bad guy.
You didnt have to come allthe way in here to say that.
I know that.
Nobody knows that.
Youre a cool cat, Donnie.
Okay.
Bye, Mr. Draper.
- Daddy!- Daddy!
How was your day?
I made it.
Wheres the salt?
Oh, Bets. No salt?
Youll see. Youll get used to it.
Its for your own good.
What would we do without you?
Why cant Daddy have salt?
Because we love him.
