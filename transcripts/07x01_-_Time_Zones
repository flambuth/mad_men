Are you ready?
Because I want youto pay attention.
This is the beginningof something.
Do you have timeto improve your life?
Do you have precisely30 seconds
for a wordfrom Accutron Watches?
The watch appears bottom third.
The second hand moveswith a fluid sweep
and above it--"Accutron Time."
You go into a business meeting.
Is there food in your teeth?Ashes on your tie?
And youve got nothing to say.
The meeting is boring,but you cant be.
But youre wearing an Accutron.
This watch makes you interesting.
Its a boardroom.Its black and white.
We hear light traffic.No talking.
We just see our man,you, late 20s,
shaggy with a youthful cowlick,but in a suit and tie.
This is a businessmanstaring at his watch
as muffled conversationswirls around him.
Now we just hearthe electronic hum.
Omm-mm.
He stands upand the faces come into view.
A couple of white-haired men
and a contemporarywho looks like Steve McQueen.
You shake hands and "Steve McQueen"gets a look at your watch.
We hear the first words.
"Is that Swiss?"
Now were in color
and its a little interviewfor the two of them
while the other men look,outlining the benefits of this watch.
It is Swiss.It is accurate.
It is the height of designand technology.
"Accutron.Its not a timepiece.
Its a conversation piece."
Wow, Freddy.
Thats a home run.
Actually,its kind of an end run.
That is not what I expected.
Theres a nice way to say that
and theres the wayyou just said it.
Well, its really good.
Theyre going to resistthat black and white thing.
Yeah, but nobodys done it.Not that I know of.
"Accutron, its timefor a conversation."
Its not as dramaticand it hides the benefit.
I dont know.It sounds more elegant to me.
Yes?
You wanted me to tell youwhen it was five minutes
until the status meeting.
Thank you, Shirley.
So, Ill see you next week.
Im gonna haveanother cup of coffee.
You really put the "free"in freelancer, dont you?
Ahem. Hello?
Hello, Daddy.
Oh.
How are you, honey?
Im well.
I thought Id catch youbefore you went to the office.
Right.
Id like to have brunchSunday morning.
Sure.Thatd be nice.
Ill bring vodka.Well have Bloody Marys.
No, in a restaurant.
How about the Plaza?They have vodka.
Itll just be me.
Sounds touching.
10:30.Bye-bye.
Bye, honey.
I feel like we reallygot somewhere last night.
Hello, Dawn.
- Gentlemen.- The team is here.
Fire when ready.
How long is this meeting?
That depends on you, doesnt it?
Who do we have here?Gladys Knight and the Pips?
Thats very hip, Lou.
- Should I get the door, Lou?- Yes, Nurse.
So, how is everybody today?
Ready for your routine checkup?
Just open your mouthsand say "ahh."
Gentlemen.
Get me those brand reviews.
Its a deadline, knuckleheads!
You know what it says to me?
It says you dont care.
And anybody who doesnt caredoesnt have to work here!
And you do not have the weekend!
- I can come back.- No.
Clara, can I get a buttered roll,please, from the lobby?
Yes, of course.
Come on in.
What are you holding?
Its Avon.You said you wanted to see me.
How many accounts do I have?
Well, its all of them.
It feels like more.
Im walking into this office every dayand I barely get ahead of things
before I get Bob from Detroitaround noon
and Pete from LA around 2:00.
Is this Avon related,
or did you just need someoneto hand you a tissue?
I have no real help except Torkelson,whos Cutlers guy.
And I think hes makingClara nightly.
- Thats juicy.- He can have her.
The point is Butler Footwearjust hired a new head of marketing
and if I meet with him,its a demotion.
Youre head of accounts.Hell think hes important.
Thats what it looks like to him.
But to Charles Butler Jr.,it looks like Im only as important
as his head of marketing.
If I have no underlings,Im useless.
Have Roger or Cutlermeet with him.
Thats two dumb ideas.Youre not listening to me.
This is a hierarchy.Do you understand that?
Tell him I couldnt make itat the last minute.
Im having dinner with Jerry Lewisor GM or somebody.
No, dont mention other clients.
Certainly.
I appreciateyour confidence in me.
- Make him go away.
I have your roll and I haveBob Benson on the line.
You see this?I dont have time to take a crap.
And last but not least,
any news from the Motor City?
Chevy XP collateral is scheduledto go to press Monday.
- Hallelujah.- But we dont have approved copy.
We dont even have a name for it.
Dang it.
Chevy graphics peoplekeep telling me
theres a "Chevy way"of doing things.
- And money is no object.- Get it in writing.
You didnt pick an anglefor Accutron.
Wow, is that today?
Sure, I did.Dawn, what did I say?
"Just in time to be on time."
That wasnt one of the choices.I think that was a digression.
How about"Accutron is accurate"?
That was one of the choices,Im positive.
"Its time for a conversation."
I think that ones more finished.
And I think youre putting mein a position of saying
I dont care what you think.
Why would you putsomething in front of me
that you dont want me to pick?
Because you told meto give you two ideas.
You apparently only gave me one.
Last week I gave you 30 choicesand you told me to bring you two.
Thats the way we do it.

Where should we start,DDB or K&E?
- Surprise me.- Oh, hey.
Well, hello there.
Why arent you brown?
- Its January in LA, too.- Thats no excuse.
Oh, Moira, can youremind me to pick up
two dozen bagelsbefore the end of my trip?
Aha.
So, the missus misses New York.
No, they are for Pete.Nan loves California.
Arent you donewith your adventure?
You know how many timesIve come down here looking for fun?
Isnt Lou fun?
Lous great.We just miss you.
Why dont you moveSt. Josephs back another day?
Youll still have time to catch up.
You can come tothe inauguration with me.
Im supposed to take Sterling,but say the word, Ill jettison.
Moira, lets start with Chevy.
Youre really going to work?
Pencil him in for tomorrow.
"Dream For Sale"playing in background
Thats what Ive been saying.
I know. Okay, Ira.Ive got to go.
Hello, Alan.
Im sorry,I think Im a little early.
First actress ever to say that.
You look wonderful, honey.
- Don Draper, this is Alan Silver.- Dont get up.
The husband is a matinee idol.
I told you.
Don, I want to get one thingout of the way.
Know that it was important to me
that you know the man your wifeis spending so much time with.
I assure you, its greedand nothing else.
I feel completely at ease.
My partners in New Yorkpromise a lot of things to girls
when they come West.
They passed off a lot of dogs.
But your girl is something.
I mean, shes the kind of girlwhos gonna shine for the network
in her callback forthe "Brackens World" pilot.
What?Get out of here.
I will not.
I thought the guy hated me.
But his boss loved you.
Ill say one thing about this girl,
she evokes strong feelings.
I feel like I just atea bag of butterflies.
Lets celebrate.
Young man.
Let me get a bottleof French champagne
for my French TV star here.
I cant believe it.When is it?
Wednesday, 9:15.We can hold off on fixing your teeth.
Obviously I jumpedthe g*n on that.
Okay.
What network?
NBC.
Such great news, honey.
Look at you two.
Youre my favorite couple.
- Mr. Barnes? Wayne?- Thats me.
Im Joan Harris from SC&P.
Should I tell themthat were ready for a table?
Maybe we should wait for Ken.
Please, sit.
- What can I get you?- Ill have a Coke.
Two Cokes.
Im so sorry.
Ken was called awayon an emergency
and rather than risk cancellingon someone so important,
he asked that I stand in.
Look, I must be crazyto be disappointed.
Im sure you had a hard timekeeping this seat empty,
but this conversationis best for Ken.
Tell me about your new position.
Head of marketing.
Thats not just new for you,thats new for Butler Footwear.
They pay me to thinkabout the four Ps--
price, product, place,and promotion.
- Thank you.- Thats a smart way to think about it.
I have a degree in business.
Its not a science,but we try to make it one.
Advertising is just a small pieceof the marketing mixture
and it might be more effectiveif its better integrated
into our business.
So are you thinkingabout bringing
one of our account executivesinto your office?
Actually, Id like to moveall our advertising in-house.
It does sound like the conversationis getting bigger than the two of us.
Theres someone above youand someone below you
and everybodys buyingeverybody dinner.
Wouldnt it be cheaper for Mr. Butlerto just walk down the hall?
SC&Ps relationshipwith Butler Footwear
is very importantto our company.
And I think youre beingshortsighted about our value.
Well, I was hired to be bold.
And Im preparedto make my recommendation.
Forgive me, but my wifewill he excited
to have me tuck the kids inat least once this week.
Certainly, I just--
could you hold off on yourrecommendation a few days
so that you can at least have the dinneryou thought you were having?
Sure.Pleasure to meet you.
You as well.
Excuse me.
Could I get a splashof whiskey in this?
Ill get the bag.You go sit down.
Take a quick look.
Then I want to turn off the lightsso you can see the view.
I like what you did with it.
I love it.
But my next houseis gonna have a pool.
Our next house.
Are you sure you dont want to moveinto a more populated area?
Its like Draculas castle up here.
Theyre far away, Don.
Its just what happensto the sound in the canyon.
Im scared, but I dont wantto turn the lights back on.
Im a little dizzy.
I just-- l need to keep walkingjust for a second.
Oh!
Im sorry.
Ill make it up to you tomorrow.
Get some rest.
Don, honey.
Please dont flick any cigarettesoff the balcony.
I dont know how,but everyone says
they can tellwhere the fire starts.
Don?
I love my scarf.
I thought with the convertible,youd need a few.
Its 9:00 and I have to get to class.
You want me to drop youat the office?
No, Ill take a cab.
Just dont work all day, okay?
And dont rip the adsout of my magazines.
Stan, you want coffee?
What are you doing here?
Im just catching up on all the workthats been going on.
Looks good.Lou, hes--
Yes, absolutely.
- So...- I have a lot to do.
Stan, do you want any coffee?
- Yes.- What?
He said yes.
Stan!
You dont have to make me any.Ill he out of here in a minute.
Hey, Ted.Good to see you.
Hey, Stan.
I thought youd be tan.
Well, youre in an office here,youre in an office there.
Whats the difference?
You know what?
Im just going to get my workand get out of here.
Good to see you guys.
None of this seemsrelated to coffee.
Buck up, chief.
Im fine.Its fine.
You look good.
You look well, too.
Iced tea.
You really branched outinto a new environment.
I did discover itin a homesick moment.
I flew back New Years Eveafter a week with my brother
and Christmas with Tammyand my in-laws.
Sat at the counter by myself
and immediately felt divine.
Ill have a Brooklyn Avenue.
Its a pastrami with the coleslawright on the sandwich.
Two of those.
Believe it or not, Brooklyn Avenueis a street in East Los Angeles.
The New Yorkers here,they brought as much as we need.
But the bagels are terrible.
Where are you living?
I have an apartmentby the tar pits.
Its one bedroom,but its two stories.
Must have quite a view.
The city is flat and uglyand the air is brown,
but I love the vibrations.
You not only dress like a hippie,you talk like one.
What have you been up to?
Keeping busy.You sign anything out here?
Yeah.
The first week I signedH. Salt Fish and Chips.
Four stores.
Didnt Roger makean announcement?
I wouldnt know.
Oh, of course.
Listen, you know if it was up to me,youd be back there already.
Hows Ted?
I noticed you timed it so that youdbe out here while he was back there.
I came to see my wife.
Yes, of course.
Ive been meaning to look her up.
Its incredible, but hes sour.
Maybe he doesnt like the sun.
Last weekend,middle of January,
Sunkist sent us outto the groves
and I picked an orangeright off the tree.
Its 75.
Theres snow on the mountains.
Ted sat in the car with the door openwriting on a pad.
Its good, isnt it?
So although Beverly Hillshas the patina of show business,
its really just accountants,lawyers, and dentists.
And you can walk to lunch,although I dont.
Very nice.
So this is the chamber of horrors.
And then thats my office.
Well, wonder who that could be.
- Hello there.- Bonnie Whiteside.
This is Don Draper.
Bonnies a real estate agent.
Shes helping me findthe ideal pad.
What, and leave the tar pits?
Its cute, but he shouldntbe renting.
Those are somenice-looking properties.
Where are you living?
I told you, honey,Dons bicoastal.
I wanted to be by the ocean,but my wife rented a house in the hills.
- Great view.- City or valley?
I dont know.
Well, when youre tiredof commuting,
give me a call.
Dont get excited, Don.
She turns it on for everyone.
Ooh!
Professor Podolsky?
Mrs. Harris, I presume?
I appreciate you meeting meon a Saturday.
Well, the price is rightand the company looks interesting.
What exactly is the company,by the way?
The client is in footwear.
Shoes, womens.
The new head of marketingwants to cut costs.
I get it.
Its 20 degrees out thereand the kids are in sandals.
Lowering overheadis not a bad idea.
Is that where youd start,
keeping in mind "the four Ps"?
Do you have an MBA?
No, but their headof marketing does.
These kids.
Believe me, Rockefeller didnt worryabout "the four Ps."
Still, Im going to needan argument
and I think its going to need to bemore technical than that.
I mean, if theyre not quitters,it makes more sense
to diversify their linesor open foreign offices.
How much to get an analysislike that in writing?
Well, lets see if you haveanything to trade.
This is a business school.Doesnt money work here?
Im doing an advertisingresearch study.
I wanted to knowwhat percentage of your clients
work on feesversus commission.
Oh.
Well, when I started working,
my goodness--16 years ago,
all of our clientswere on commission.
We started discussinga fee-based model three years ago.
Now were at 50-50.
I dont knowif you can answer this,
or even understand it,
but what is the difference?
Actually, I can answer that.
Youre going to need another pad.
Hello.
You frying bacon?
Its in the coq au vin.
And I made bread puddingwith blueberries in it for dessert.
Any wine leftor did the chicken drink it all?
I picked you up a bottle.
Better.
I think you have the wrong address.I dont know--
Fellas, why dont youput it over there?
Over where?Its huge.
By the window. Theres a wall.Thats where it goes.
- Thank you very much.- Youve got to sign.
Thank you.
Why did you do that?
- You have an antenna on the roof?- Its huge.
Its the way they make them now.
Hows it gonna look, Don?
You know, everyoneI know here is starving.
Youre going to be on TV.
Dont you want to watch yourselfin living color?
Dont jinx me.
I didnt know an expensive giftwould upset you.
Youre not herelong enough for a fight.
What are you doing up so late?
My mama said to tell youthe toilets clogged.
Well, shes not supposedto flush things down it.
Shell know whatIm talking about.
My mama said some peoplejust throw it out the window,
but shes not gonna.
You got to fix it.
Im sorry, Julio,but l just got home from work.
Its Saturday.Why you got to work?
You got to fix it!
You could ask nicely.That might work better.
- She said to yell at you.- Why?
Because you dont listen.
I dont understand her!
Here. This is yours.Its a gift. Good night.


"Lost Horizon" scoreplaying on TV
What is this?
Lets go to bed.
Hey.
Yes?
We havent celebrated.
Oh, I didnt knowif you wanted to.
I do.
Let me brush my teeth.
Hold on.
Are you okay?
Im just--
I dont know why I feel nervous.
About this?
About everything.
Dont.
Good morning.
How much time do we have?
Im on the red-eye.
I hate this.
We have the rest of the day.
I know.
Im sorry, but I haveto get back to work.
Hello.
They saved all the constructionfor Sunday.
Its okay, Daddy.Catch your breath.
Its so good to see you.
Sweetheart, being summonedmakes me nervous.
No, everything is wonderful.
Can you give us a minute?
To the fear of an ambush.
To being together.
What the hell are you up to?
I just wanted to see you
and tell you that its beentoo long and that...
well, when all is said and done,
I forgive you.
Thats beautiful to hear.
Because I forgive you, too.
No, Daddy.
I forgive you.
And I forgive you.
All of your transgressions...
abandoning Mother,
making me ask for money,
your intermittentinterest in Ellery.
I dont even carethat you smell like incense
or have any thoughts aboutyour current, quote, "state of affairs."
I-- I simply forgive you.
You want me to say Im sorry?
Because I dont agreewith all that.
Where the hellis this coming from?
Well, if you must know,Ive been searching.
And with a little help,Ive come to understand
that anger can bevanquished by love.
Are you going to church?
Not in any wayyoud understand.
- What do you want from me?- Nothing.
You cant make it better.
So now were just supposedto eat eggs Benedict?
I would love that.
Good evening.
Evening.
Thank you.
Do you want a sleeping pill?
No, thank you.
You know what?
Me either.
Im sorry.Dont tell me you enjoy flying.
I fly a lot.
And Im always hopingI was seated next to,
well, someone like you...
instead of a man with a hairpieceeating a banana.
But why would I expectanything else?
You can blameMadison Avenue for that.
Ladies and gentlemen,this is your captain speaking.
Where were you?I was worried.
I thought we hatedall things domestic.
You sound uptight.
Man walks in,obviously having tied one on,
woman says,"Where were you?"
Kind of establishment.
Why are you being so mean?
Move over.
Oh, Christ.Move him over, too.
Is that my vest?
If you were with someone,I dont care.
You know anyones welcomein this bed.
I just want to get some sleep.
Id like to put this on,but vanity is preventing me.
You want me to wear mineso I dont see you?
This is nice.I usually sleep alone.
What about the manthat gave you that ring?
He passed away.
A year ago, actually.
I was--
he wanted his ashesscattered at Pebble Beach.
How was that?
I failed.
Its a very popular spotfor such things.
Apparently, they dont wantanother sand trap.
I ended up at his second choice.
Disneyland.
Really?
- Have you ever been there?- I have.
Where is he now?
Tom Sawyer Island.
Thats probablya popular destination, too.
Yes, they were very vigilant.
It took some doing.
How old was he?
He would have been 50.
So, much older?
He worked fast, too.
What happened to him?
He was thirsty.
He died of thirst.
His company sent himto a hospital.
I went with him.
I was supposed to bepart of the cure somehow.
And all I did was observe.
I thought he wasreally getting better.
Then a doctor told mehed be dead in a year.
All of them would be.
Im gonna close my eyes now.
Ladies and gentlemen,good morning.
Despite our best efforts,were still stacked up,
but it looks like were two away.
I think that well beginour descent in 15 minutes.
Sorry, l think I dozed off.
You have a few more minutes.
If I was your wife,I wouldnt like this.
She knows Im a terrible husband.
How long have youbeen married?
Not long enough.
I really thoughtI could do it this time.
- Did she kick you out?- No.
She doesnt know that much,but she knows.
Well, if she doesnt know,you should just keep it that way.
Thats what people do.
I keep wondering...
have I broken the vessel?
If you did,what can you do about it?
Its done.
I bet I could make youfeel better.
I bet you could.
Theres a car waiting for me.I can give you a lift.
Im sorry, but I haveto get back to work.
Your tenant Mrs. Rodriguezcalled again about her toilet.
She was hard to understand,but I think she said
shes calling the alderman.
Ugh.
Call my sister Anitaand tell her to get Gerry
and his friendthe plumber up there.
- Shouldnt I just call Gerry?- No.
Anita can askher husband, I cant.
- Good morning, ladies.- Good morning.
- How was your weekend?- Peachy. Cut up some firewood.
Im sorry about last week.
Youre right that I shouldnt havesuggested something I didnt like.
I never gave it another thought.
Well, I did and I realizedthat Freddys original idea
was the best,but I didnt do it justice.
What are you doing?I already said yes.
“Accutron,
its not a timepiece,its a conversation piece."
Forget it.
- Morning.- Morning, Lou.
This is actually a big idea.
Why are you making this so hard?
Open the door and walk in.
You do not need to parachute inthrough the ceiling.
But I dont mind.l just want to give you my best.
I dont know, Peggy-
I guess Im immuneto your charms.
Can I get some coffee?
Good morning, Clara.ls Ken in yet?
No, hes on the plane.
As soon as he lands, I need to speakwith him regarding Butler.
Good for you.Mr. Butler is coming in this week.
What?
Get Wayne Barneson the line-- now.
Mr. Barnes on line three.
Joan?
- You already set a meeting?- Good morning.
I took you seriously,but you didnt take me seriously.
Look, I know youre fightingfor your job, but dont get emotional.
Im fighting for your job.
Okay, well, I appreciate it,but dont worry about me.
- Ill be fine.- Are you sure?
Lets talk about your in-houseadvertising agency.
You think you can gointo a network or a newspaper
with your checkbookand get the space we get
when we deal with themevery day with 30 clients?
You will be competingagainst us,
not againstother shoe companies.
We both know the shoe businessis going to decline
for some time in the future.
If you make a bold move now,
that decline will beyour responsibility.
What are you gonna do then?
You can only fire us once.
So what am I supposed to do?
I already set the meeting.
Cancel it.
No, Im asking you,
what do I do?
Tell them we cancelledthe meeting.
We need more time to presenta revised media strategy.
- Yes.- Good.
Im still expecting to meet with Ken.
Ill follow up on that today.
Youd better.
Did you tell him to preparemore boards for Accutron?
- Do you want to do it?- No, I want to do it.
- I dont know what I did.- Get out of here.
He may be in the art department,but he reports to me.
We already have boardsfor "Accutron is accurate."
You know thats a loser.
I think if he could see both of them,hell change his mind.
Or at least let usshow both to the client.
Let it go, baby.Its dead.
No, l just dont think hes given itthe proper thought.
Youre telling your bossyou think hes stupid.
Well, Im tired of fightingfor everything to be better.
Youre all a bunch of hackswho are perfectly happy with shit.
Nobody cares about anything.
No one wants thingsto be better, I got it.
Ill just stand out hereall by myself.
We find ourselves rich in goods,but ragged in spirit--
reaching with magnificent precisionfor the moon,
but falling intoraucous discord on Earth.
We are caught in w*rwanting peace.
Were torn by divisionwanting unity.
We see around us empty liveswanting fulfillment.
We see tasks that need doing...
- Come in.- ...waiting for hands to do them.
You know Im breaking a rule here.
I havent had one of thesesausages since I quit.
If this makes mehave dreams about beer,
Im gonna be mad at you.
Oh, no, no, no.Come on.
I should be paying you.
You want that balcony door open?Its freezing outside.
Peggy went bananasfor your Accutron work.
Of course she lifted her leg on it.
Also, I swang byJ. Walter Thompson,
thinking there was an emergencywith our copy for 7-Up.
- You want a sweater?- Nah.
Turns out theyre lookingfor help on Oscar Mayer.
You are making quite a namefor me out there.
Bologna? Hot dogs?Its moms and kids either way.
Why dont you stop this Cyrano bit
and march your ass in thereand get us both a job?
Because I have a job.
Its been two months.
Nobodys called, right?
Im still being paid.
Well, they had Christmaswithout you.
The Super Bowl.Pretty soon its gonna be Easter.
You know, Ive been there.
You dont wantto be damaged goods.
I tried to get a hold of you.
Why? I spoke to Clara.Thank you for solving that problem.
I bailed it out,but I think its irreparable.
Its only a matter of timebefore we lose it.
Every account man whos ever comeinto my office has said that.
But they havent allleft one of these.
- Oh.- Stay out of my office.
Sorry.
I dozed off.
Well, Jimmy says hell be backin the morning.
He needed a part.
Oh, youve got to be kidding me.
It seems silly for you to go all the wayout to Brooklyn and come back.
It wont take longthis time of night.
Are you sure?
I dont like Anita therealone in the house.
Of course.
- See you in the morning.- Okay.
