So you haventofficially told anyone
youre looking to changeyour life?
Yes.
Why put Doyle Daneinto hysterics
when all I want to dois have what NASA calls
an "exploratory mission"with your agency?
Still, Timmy, Don hassome anxiety about--
well, obviously about Raymond.
Heinz Baked Beans has given us
national recognitionand Raymonds a friend.
Im not used to telling peoplewhat my account is worth.
Not just in billings,
but in the prestigethat comes with ketchup.
Don knows thator he wouldnt be here.
Hes not that polite.
Just relax.
If you do the workand I like it,
I guarantee that Raymondwill fall in line.
I have that power.
And if you dont like our work?
Raymond never has to know.
I dont know if thatsolves my problem.
Look, I understand your risk.
Or we could have metin your office again.
In fact, we can havethe presentation here, too.
No, well get a hotel.
I am supposed to be meetingsomeone in about 20 minutes
and she likes meto wait for her.
Well, take your time.
And remember,
I dont need much of anexcuse to come to Manhattan.
When I say a small team,I mean Stan.
Just the three of us.
We bill it under Project K.
Nice place.
Well, its available to you.
You know, if you ever have tospend the night in the city.
I live here, Pete.
Its been 7:00for 20 minutes.
Im starving.
Im sorry Im late,but I have a job.
You know what, Dawn?You have another job,
which is beingmy maid of honor.
Well, I cant losethat one, can I?
Well, I have some bad news.
Al called me
and he said both the catererand your date fell through.
William?What happened?
Al doesnt thinkhes ready to settle down.
And he didnt want you to spendthe night defending yourself.
You tell Al to keep looking
because Im never gonna meetsomeone at that office.
Al and I met at church.
Church is impossible.
You cant stand outin that crowd of harlots.
You stand out.
You must run intosomebody downtown.
I get on the trainand its just us...
and then it gets thinnerand thinner until about 72nd.
Sometimes its just meand this old shoeshine--
and he wont even look at me.
Bea Carter says her sonAnthony ran into you.
But thats whatyou dont understand.
We were walkingthrough the plaza
and we passed each otherand we just nodded.
Someone told me he said that,
but he didnt talk to me.
And I didnt talkto him, either.
Well, Ill keep looking.
That might be too much blush.
If you look a little rusty,its cause Im a little rusty.
I need all the help I can get.
The makeupsnot the important part.
Mary Kay always says its reallyabout making yourself feel better,
and that starts withdoing something for you.
Well, thatll be a first.
- Kate!- Shh, I just put the baby down.
- You have not changed.- Well, you have.
How did you suddenlyget younger than me?
Because shes inthe beauty business.
What do you think?
- How much did she spend?- Its free.
This is my old stuff.Im a sales director now.
- How are your boys?- Good.
- Did you see Kevin?- She looked in.
Why dont we let him sleepwhile we eat dinner?
I made a pork roast.
And I made reservationsat Le Cirque for two.
Well, I want to catch up.And, more importantly,
Kate has a job interview tomorrowand I dont want her tying one on.
- Who are you meeting with?- The competition.
Can we take a raincheck?
Splendid.
She hasnt changed.
Why are you getting onthe elevator going up?
Because the door openedand you were standing there.
I pressed down.
Where have you been?
I missed you.
Working all the time.Dont tell anyone.
Like who?
Arnies on callThursday or Friday.
Ill leave a penny under themat when hes flown the coop.
I have to go.
Can you be more specific?
Nope.
Good night.
Dennis must be doing well.
- Thats from the company.- My goodness.
What do you have to doto get this?
Just have a lot of my recruitssell a lot of Mary Kay.
How much?Those are diamonds.
Just has to be the most.
They know what theyre doing.
I know.They do.
But theres no wayfor me to move up there.
So is that whyyoure going to Avon?
Theres womenabove me at Mary Kay,
Its just workingout of Spokane,
theres only so far I can go.
Well, Joanies a partnerand I dont know if anyone
would want all thatextra responsibility.
You should visit more often.
Turns outsomeones proud of me.
Im a monster.
Believe it or not,"My daughter is a partner
at a Madison Avenueadvertising firm"
is something I enjoy saying.
It does sound pretty good.
Well, so much for keepingmy wits about me.
I should be gettingback to the Waldorf.
Well, I wish youthe best of luck tomorrow.
But if worse come to worse,
youre appreciated somewhere.
What are the "Life" magazineclosing dates for Birds Eye?
Ken, its Monday.
I got a perfect cup of coffeeand a Danish on the way.
You want to start with "Good morning?How was your weekend?"
I spent it with my in-lawslistening to Ed complain
about how much the worldhates Dow Chemical.
And I know that every gripe he hasis directed at me and this company.
Is it possible that this has turnedKen Cosgrove into a neurotic?
If he wants peopleto stop hating him,
he should stop droppingnapalm on children.
I know you just camehere to complain,
but I actually thinkthat I can help you.
God, thats really true.
I just came in hereto complain.
How hard would it be to meetwith Ed, just you and me?
If I have a good reason?
Im sorry, Mr. Cosgrove,but its the last one.
- Did you find your keys?- I did.
Can you get PierreCossette on the line?
I have an idea.Lets see what happens.
Harry has great ideas.
I saw this thing on a spy show.
Its a clockwith a tiny camera in it.
All we have to dois get it in there.
If you can get in,you dont need a clock.
I would guessits a military account.
And I would guessthey picked Stan
because he has no conscience.
So Project K stands for what?
Project k*ll Machine!
Thats not what it stands for.
So what doesit stand for, Bobby?
I dont know what it is.
Are you saying that becauseyou do know what it is?
No.
- Stan come through?- Stan who?
I know one thing-- hes not ina room with tinfoil on the windows.
How are things, Don?
Theres nothing in here.
Cause youre gonnafill it with work.
- If you dont fall asleep.- Mmm.
Im telling you,it clears the cobwebs.
I think a hot dog and ahamburger are too similar.
Plus, a hot dogcries out for mustard.
No, I think a hot dogcries out for ketchup.
A squiggly line.
Hmm.
I think we should order lunch.
Mmm.
My goodness. Someones havinga party and didnt invite us.
I dont know whatyoure talking about.
Is Claras birthday today?
Its tomorrowand its $2 a head.
And, actually, I dont knowwhat Im going to get.
- Do you want to come?- I cant.
Mr. Draperalways needs me.
Could you punch me outwhen you leave?
Really?
How long are yougoing to be gone?
Well, if you punch me out...
Okay.
I heard Mr. Drapersin there.
No.
- Did you get the pages?- No.
Are you two rehearsing already?
Call me when you see them.
Arlene, are you sadits not you?
You know Mel is my husband.
I could have him write youinto a hospital bed
or a grave.
Im sorry.
Whats going on?
Well, youre going to havea love scene with Rod.
And between you, me, andsoon a national audience,
its more of a love affair.
Oh, my goodness.
Thats so exciting.
Thank you for telling me.
Oh, I did more than tell you.
Mels been on the fence,
but I think he reallybelieves in you.
Now, dont embarrass me.
Youve done thisbefore, havent you?
Um, well, of course.
Does a high school play count?
No.
Its gonna be exciting at first
and then itll bepart of the job.
Its pretty exciting.
The hard part is how "JamesGarner" there will deal with it.
Some people think its better towait till after its happened
or not tell them at all, but Ithink its best to be up front.
Well, obviouslyhes not going to like it.
Would you be upset if he did?
I dont know.
Why dont Mel and I takeyou two out to dinner?
You know, to makehim comfortable.
And, honestly, all of usshould be better acquainted.
I mean, Mel hasbig plans for you.
Im gonna leaveyou alone with these.
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere?- No, Meredith.
Well, its just I cantfind her or Mr. Crane
and theres someone to see him.
Im dying for you to meet Ken.
How are you?
Busy.
Have Scarlett see mewhen you find her.
Oh, good.Youre home on time.
I am. Its only becauseI have a lot of work
and I dont want to doit in a windowless room.
So why dont you have a seat?
Im gonna get you a drink.
And then Im gonnastuff you with coq au vin.
I know youre very busy,
but I want us to have,I dont know--
I want us to be able to talkabout things other than work.
Megan, what happened?
Just once Id liketo be that wife
that lays a trap and has herhusband walk right into it.
Okay, first of all, Arlene,
you know, she playsPenelope Aldridge.
She basically owns"Berkshire Falls."
Shes married to Melthe head writer
and they want to havedinner with us.
Does it get worse?
Well, my storylineis getting more developed
and that means
Im gonna havea series of love scenes.
- With whom?- With Rod Holly.
He plays Rafe Jackson.Hes Arlenes nephew.
Megan, I dont care.
Whats a "love scene"consist of?
Its just kissing and hugging.
Its TV. We cantreally do anything.
What am I supposed to say?
That you trust me.
And that you knowits part of my job.
And maybe that it was bound tohappen if things went well.
Keep going. Im dying tohear what I say next.
Should I havehidden it from you?
I dont know, Megan.I need to think about it.
Look, I knowI wouldnt like it,
but Id lookon the bright side.
Okay, I guess if Iwasnt your husband,
I would be happy for you.
It does mean they like you.
Do you like me?
Honey, I can tolerate this,but I cant encourage it.
Youre perfect.
And, honestly, Ed, its not just Kenwhos been losing sleep about this.
I mean, last week when half ofColombia got into your lobby--
It was 15 people.
Look, youve been inthe news every other day
and a couple of articlesplaced in business journals
are not goingto make that stop.
They acted like theywere storming the Bastille.
This is their country, too.
What exactly is your point?
Pierre.
A one-hour prime-time TVspecial sponsored by Dow,
starring Joe Namath and 15or so of his best friends
putting on a show drawing fromAmericas most beloved musicals.
"Broadway Joeon Broadway."
Joe Namath sings?
Dont you want to watchit just to find out?
And who are his "friends"?
I have access to thegreatest talent available.
Therell be sex appeal. JoeyHeatherton, for example.
Pipes, Julie Andrews.And punch.
How about John Wayne in asketch version of "Camelot"?
Were mostlyhousehold products.
Women dont like football.
Have you ever asked themabout Joe Namath?
Forget demographics.
How would you like Dow to beresponsible for making people smile?
And is there anythingthat makes people smile
more than Broadwayand football?
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" andthe Notre Dame fight song
playing at the same time.
♪ Im a YankeeDoodle Dandy... ♪
♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪
Okay, okay.
Kenny, did you tell themI went to Notre Dame?
No, I told themabout Joey Heatherton.
So its tailor-madefor us?
Whats our commitment?
Well, youd be a corner tenant.
Theres six minutesof commercials in the hour,
youd get three and thentwo 10-second billboards
at the beginningand end of the show.
"Brought to youby Dow Chemical,
family productsfor the American family."
Just imagineJoe Namath in a straw hat.
Im sorryto bother you, Scarlett,
but is Mr. Crane in?
Okay.No, hes in a meeting.
Is there somethingI can help you with?
Well, if hes expectingany special guests,
you should let us know because he had someonecome yesterday and you werent here.
I must have beenin the ladies room.
No, and its strange becauseyou didnt leave until 6:47.
Oh, Joan, its Clarasbirthday today
and I tried to go at lunch,but I got stuck at my desk.
So I left Mr. Craneon his own
while I attendedto this company business.
We got her a Givenchyscarf from Gimbels.
I have the card herefor you to sign.
But you never came back and youhad Dawn punch your time card.
No, Dawn and Iwere working together.
But we were all over the place.
But mostly in accounting.
Thank you for clearing that up.
Dawn.
Have you spokento Scarlett this morning?
Were missing the big hole punch and Ithink you were the last one to see her.
The hole punchis in the creative lounge.
Dawn, Scarletttold me everything.
Scarlett, youre fired.
Joan, please.It wont happen again.
Not here it wont.Go get your things.
Dawn, could you get Stan in here
- before the partners meeting?- Ill deal with you later.
Girls do it all the time.
Just go before you reallyembarrass yourself.
I hope you realize this meansnow youre on Eds radar.
So will I be invitedto Sunday dinner?
Something like that.
I dont know where youre going, butI want you to bring back champagne.
Oh, Harry, Im not coming back.
What are you talking about?
Joan, you oweScarlett an apology.
Harry, please dontinvolve yourself in this.
Im tired of yourpetty dictatorship.
So whatever capital crime or treasonshe committed, shes in my department.
I didnt realize you werethat attached to Scarlett.
- Were not attached.- We are attached!
I have somethingmore important to do.
I would hope you do, too.
Scarlett, do whateveryou think is best.
You are to dowhatever I think is best.
Lets go.Back to work.
Everythings fine.
I understandthe confidentiality,
but I need to knowhow to bill Project K.
Dont.
Meredith, whydont you step out?
I dont know what she said because Imnot privy to these conversations,
but I would like the chanceto defend myself.
- Mr. Crane, I havent--- No, please.
Let him go on.
Well, its this simple-- Scarlett worksfor me and Joan tried to fire her.
She left work early and hadDawn punch her time card.
Its pay for a minimumof five hours of work
that she didnt dothat we are paying for.
Well, its either me or her.
- Joan?- Scarlett.
I think you mean,"If she goes, I go."
"Broadway Joeon Broadway."
Is there anybody in herewho thought of that?
- I did.- What the hell is that?
Its $150,000 worthof incremental business
I generated while solving a problem.For what?
So I can stand outside that glassand watch you all in here?
- What did Dawn do?- Well, Im almost positive--
Just keep talking to herbecause shes a partner.
You know what?
Im sorry my accomplishmentshappened in broad daylight
and I cant be giventhe same rewards.
What is that supposed to mean?
You know damn well.
The next time this groupis called to order,
I expect to be sittingat this table.
Ive actually earned it.
Dont worry, dear.Thats not going to happen.
Joan, I dont want to put myselfin the same camp as Harry,
but I might remind youand everyone
the Commission on Human Rightsis continuing to investigate
our industry regardingthe employment of Negroes.
Shes a good secretary.
Of course.
What about Scarlett?
I think this humiliationwill suffice.
Can we continuewith the billings?
Yes.
Where were we?
"Meredith, why dont youstep out?"
Well?
Oh.
Im sorry,but I couldnt leave.
I dont care as long as youbrought those bridal magazines.
What is wrong with you?
I had a day today thatpushed your stupid wedding
to the bottom of the list.
- Did you get fired?- No.
I dont think so.
Who can tell at that place?
What happened?
One of the girlsasked me to punch out
her time cardand we got caught.
I told you, those girlsarent your friends.
Yes, they are. She gotin more trouble than me.
Why do you think she asked you?
You cant say nocause youre too scared.
All they see is,"Yes, sir."
Everybodys scared there.
Women cryingin the ladies room.
Men crying in the elevator.
It sounds like New Years Evewhen they empty the garbage,
there are so many bottles.
And I told you about that poor manhanging himself in his office.
Oh, they got it so bad,
they must allbe jealous of you.
What am I gonna do? Throw abrick through their window?
I want to keep my job,
so Im gonna keep my head down.
Well, I couldnt do it.
Well, you dont have to.
Youre getting married.
And dinner.
I should have brought Dennis.
Youre not evenlistening to me.
Im sorry.I need a drink
and this placeis a soda fountain.
I feel like Im in high schoolright down to the clientele.
Hello?
Were sitting here waitingfor a phone to ring.
This actually is high school.
So what do you do to have fun?
I dont look in a guidebook.
This wasnt ina guidebook, okay?
My friend told me about it.
Is she a nun or just theright age for this place?
Apparently there arequite a few men here
who go for a certain type.
Oh.
Joanie, dont judge me.Im in New York.
Good evening, ladies.
If theres anything you need,Ill be over there.
Catherines got a lotof tables, so dont hesitate.
Im Leo.
Im Kate.And this is Joan.
Actually, I dont thinkour phone is working.
- Can you test it?- Ill see what I can do.
How many girls come in here andcomplain that their phones are broken?
Hes cute.Reminds me of Scotty.
Well, dont marry him.
That was the worstsix months of my life.
You always dideverything first.
But you did everything smart.
Well, tonight were justa couple of young secretaries.
Answer it.
Ahem.Hello?
How did you do that?
I didnt do anything.He likes you.
What?
Oh.
Just a minute.Let me ask my girlfriend.
He wants us to meet himafter his shift.
Well, tell himyou know a place.
But I dont.Do you?
- Should I invite him to my room?- No.
We were just tryingto think of a place.
Tell him to think of a place.
Do you know of a place?
Oh, good.
- Hang up.- Till then.
Okay, now I need a drink.
Do you honestly believea few jokes
on the "Smothers Brothers"are really upsetting people?
I think its the sponsorsand the network
dont want to havea conversation about the w*r.
Id like to have an evening withouta conversation about the w*r.
Darling, youshouldnt smoke so much.
The weight you loseisnt worth the wrinkles.
See, I think the sponsorsare for the w*r.
They dont want to haveany dissent.
Don, youre a writer.You know this is censorship.
I am a writerand Im against the w*r,
but when you buy a commercial,
youre hoping that the consumer
is in a good mood whenthey hear your message.
So if you agree ona wholesome variety show
and all of a suddenits filled with satire--
the most threateninghumor there is--
youre worried about peoplehating what youre selling.


Megan, lets talk about you
and how you found this man.
I could castyou, you know that.
Yes, Im sure he is a manwho plays many roles.
Luckily you dont haveto worry about censorship
with the showbecause its so tame.
Of course its fordaytime entertainment.
Its for housewives.
It has to bea little titillating.
We have our own standards.
Although theyve beenvery liberal with us.
But, you know,
when we do things on the show,
its all very tasteful.
Well, its not real life.
Why dont you let meget the check?
We go back to our pad,smoke some grass,
and... seewhat happens.
Sounds like fun.
I dont know.Its late.
Its not.
Look, if you dontsmoke grass, thats fine.
Its not everythingwe had in mind.
Im not sure if I understand.
We like Megan.
And we like you.
And wed like to be friends.
Us, too.
Well, then...
I guess its not impossibleunder the right circumstances
for us to becomebetter acquainted.
Hey, it may not work.Its a chemistry experiment.
I have a big day tomorrow.You both know that.
Thats work.This is play.
I have to get up very early.
Thats whatblack coffee is for.
I make it delicious.
Uh...
maybe another time.
Arlene, weve heard"no" before.
I guess theres no reasonto skip dessert.
What?
This is the best seat.
St. Marks between2nd and 3rd, please.
Have you been tothe Electric Circus?
- All the time.- Were from out of town.
Lets see who kisses better.
Im not playing this game.
Because shell lose.
What the hell was that?
What? They like youand they like me.
Theyd like us to be friends.
They were so out in the open.
It was a good strategy.I kept thinking
he was going to ask me for ajob directing commercials.
Maybe he was waitingfor tomorrow morning
- when we were basking in the afterglow.- Dont.
Just a pile of arms and legs.
I dont know whetherto laugh or be sick
because now I think
thats the reasonthey gave me the scene.
Im sure theyve tried that
with plenty of peoplewho havent gotten scenes.
Don, I have to goback to work with them.
Itll be better than ever.How long have they been married?
18 years.
Im busy.
Come up for air.
Oh, hey.
Would you mind?
This is my friend.
Im Johnny.
Joan. Pleased to meet you.
Johnny and Joan.
Bonnie and Clyde.
- Do you want a drink?- I have one.
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
Whatd I say?
What did he say?
He said Id want you.
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
Well, w*r or no w*r,
Nixon doesnt think hesrunning against Johnson.
He thinks hes running againstthe ghost of Kennedy.
So does Johnson.
I dont know where Helen is.
How are you both this morning?
Frankly, were a littleembarrassed.
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize.That was not my intention.
How are Jennifer,Bea, and the twins?
Its Nathan and Steven, right?
Yes.
Theyre well, thank you.
That displayyesterday of--
well, of initiative
really caught our attention.
This is a check for $23,500.
Thats the full commissionon "Broadway Joe."
Well, thank you.
Thats a lot of money.
So, anything else to say?
Im puzzled. What do youmake a year, Mr. Crane?
22. So what aboutthe partnership?
You want some of the spoils.Well, there you go.
We have to get biggerbefore we get bigger.
What a load of crap.
- You know, Joans not even in yet.- Leave her out of this.
Bert, you knowhow important I am
to this company.You were me.
I was different than you,Mr. Crane, in every way.
- So you dont want the money?- No, Ive earned the money.
But Ive also earneda partnership.
I really hope some other firmdoesnt figure that out first.
That was the mostimpressive thing hes done.
Should we fire himbefore he cashes that check?
- Arent you gonna be late?- Arent you?
I love you.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Im really wakingyou this time.
Kate.
Honey, wake up.
Now you two layaboutshave to bathe him.
I have an appointment.
Mom, Im still going to work.
Do you need to throw up?
Mother, can yougive us a minute?
Why did I do that?
You had some fun.
I just wanted to try it.
Now youll go home and youll findeverything right where it belongs.
Im really not you, am I?
Why would you want to be?
Are you kidding?
Look what you did.
You came out here,
you staked this outon your own.
I always had Dennisto fall back on.
Even when I went to Mary Kay.
You didnt.
And I never will.
Howd that happen?
The whole reasonI even talked to Avon
is because I wanted...
I dont know,
what you have.
Its not what you think.
Youre an executive.
Its a title.
And money.
Ive been working therefor 15 years
and they still treatme like a secretary.
Whats it have to do with them?
Youre there, Joan.
And from where Im sitting,its damn impressive.
I dont carehow they make you feel,
its right in frontof you for the taking.
Ill be back in an hour.
There you go.
Oh.
Okay, Ill draw the bath.
Its clean, its simple,
and its tantalizinglyincomplete.
Whats missing?One thing.
"Pass the Heinz."
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.
Its Heinz.It only means one thing.
It feels like half an ad.
The greatest thingyou have working for you
is not the photo you takeor the picture you paint.
Its the imaginationof the consumer.
They have no budget.They have no time limit.
And if you can getinto that space,
your ad can run all day.
Well, Pete,you said Id say it.
Its pretty bold work.
I think I stillwant to see our bottle.
I thought thatat first, too, but--
We will test it both ways.
Its a testament to ketchup
that there can be no confusion.
Let me chew on it, fellas.
Youre going to be thinkingof ketchup all day
and you didnt even see it.
Thank you.
Well be in touch.
Well, hello.
Hello.
Ted, you want to come in?
I hope you left us something.
Good to see you.
Its a bake-off?Since when?
- Come on, Don.- Go wait by the elevator.
Peggy.
So, whats the differencebetween ketchup and catsup?
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,
comes in a bigger bottle,
is cheaper, but tastesjust like ketchup.
Now, we know thats not true,
but thats whatyour competitors are saying.
Over and over.
And theyre selling theirwatered-down, flavorless sauce
by pretending that theyre you.
Makes you angry, doesnt it?
Me, too.
But I always say
if you dont likewhat theyre saying,
change the conversation.
"Heinz.The only ketchup."
Imagine this 40 feet tall
in Times Square.
Ketchup versus catsup--
end of conversation.
- Good morning.- Good afternoon.
Thank you.
Joan, may I have a word?
Im sorry I was notmore forthright with you.
I think it would only befair if you docked my pay
to cover the hoursScarlett did not work.
Fair to whom?Scarlett?
I dont know.Fair to the company?
This is the keyto the supply closet
and this is the keyto the time cards.
You will be responsiblefor monitoring both.
What?
Okay.
- Thank you.- Dont thank me.
You dont understandthat this is punishment.
Well, I dont careif everybody hates me here
as long as you dont.
Well see.
So theres two of us.
Were boththe same size agency.
Youre not afraid ofa little heads-up baseball.
I only did it because no oneelse was supposed to know.
I think everythingshould be done in secret.
Lock me in that Project K room,Ill work on anything, Don.
I miss it already.
Mind if we jointhe Lonely Hearts Club?
Who says were not celebrating?
J. Walter Thompson.They bought it in the room.
Are you kidding me?We paid for that room.
What do you know?
The biggest agencyin the world.
Oh, Im glad youre here.
See, I just got offthe phone with Raymond Geiger
and he said that youwere at the Roosevelt
giving a presentationto the ketchup brand manager.
But I said that was impossiblebecause how could that happen
at my firm without me knowing?
Because no onewas supposed to know.
Let me get a rye rocksand an Old Spanish.
Im sorry, Ken.Damn it.
Ill call him.Ill work it out.
Dont bother.
He doesnt even wantto give us 90 days.
Theres nothing better thanbeing known for your loyalty.
You hear that, Ted?
Vinegars, sauces,and beans is available.
Help yourself.Its a gold mine.
Theyd love that.
Theres a pie and theyslice it into pieces
and they throw the tiniestpiece into the yard
and let all the smallagencies fight over it.
Speak for yourself.
It was worth the risk.
I think I see a friend.
Please, Rafe,you have a family.
I have a familythat ignores me,
that treats me likeIve never been there.
But you, you make mefeel new again.
I work for you.
And for her.
Shes good to me.
Stop fighting.
I dont know how muchlonger I can take this.
This is your bedyou share with her.
I cant.
Rafe, we cant.
Corinne, dont deny this,whats between us.
Dont deny me whenI know you feel it too.
I do.
Rafe.
You like to watch, do you?
Oh, Rafe.
And were clear.
Everyone tothe conservatory set.
- Very nice, everyone.- You did great.
Thank you.
