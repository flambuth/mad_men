So you haven't officially told anyone
you're looking to change your life?
Yes.
Why put Doyle Dane into hysterics
when all I want to do is have what NASA calls
an "exploratory mission" with your agency?
Still, Timmy, Don has some anxiety about--
well, obviously about Raymond.
Heinz Baked Beans has given us
national recognition and Raymond's a friend.
I'm not used to telling people what my account is worth.
Not just in billings,
but in the prestige that comes with ketchup.
Don knows that or he wouldn't be here.
He's not that polite.
Just relax.
If you do the work and I like it,
I guarantee that Raymond will fall in line.
I have that power.
And if you don't like our work?
Raymond never has to know.
I don't know if that solves my problem.
Look, I understand your risk.
Or we could have met in your office again.
In fact, we can have the presentation here, too.
No, we'll get a hotel.
I am supposed to be meeting someone in about 20 minutes
and she likes me to wait for her.
Well, take your time.
And remember,
I don't need much of an excuse to come to Manhattan.
When I say a small team, I mean Stan.
Just the three of us.
We bill it under Project K.
Nice place.
Well, it's available to you.
You know, if you ever have to spend the night in the city.
I live here, Pete.
It's been 7:00 for 20 minutes.
I'm starving.
I'm sorry I'm late, but I have a job.
You know what, Dawn? You have another job,
which is being my maid of honor.
Well, I can't lose that one, can I?
Well, I have some bad news.
Al called me
and he said both the caterer and your date fell through.
William? What happened?
Al doesn't think he's ready to settle down.
And he didn't want you to spend the night defending yourself.
You tell Al to keep looking
because I'm never gonna meet someone at that office.
Al and I met at church.
Church is impossible.
You can't stand out in that crowd of harlots.
You stand out.
You must run into somebody downtown.
I get on the train and it's just us...
and then it gets thinner and thinner until about 72nd.
Sometimes it's just me and this old shoeshine--
and he won't even look at me.
Bea Carter says her son Anthony ran into you.
But that's what you don't understand.
We were walking through the plaza
and we passed each other and we just nodded.
Someone told me he said that,
but he didn't talk to me.
And I didn't talk to him, either.
Well, I'll keep looking.
That might be too much blush.
If you look a little rusty, it's 'cause I'm a little rusty.
I need all the help I can get.
The makeup's not the important part.
Mary Kay always says it's really about making yourself feel better,
and that starts with doing something for you.
Well, that'll be a first.
- Kate! - Shh, I just put the baby down.
- You have not changed. - Well, you have.
How did you suddenly get younger than me?
Because she's in the beauty business.
What do you think?
- How much did she spend? - It's free.
This is my old stuff. I'm a sales director now.
- How are your boys? - Good.
- Did you see Kevin? - She looked in.
Why don't we let him sleep while we eat dinner?
I made a pork roast.
And I made reservations at Le Cirque for two.
Well, I want to catch up. And, more importantly,
Kate has a job interview tomorrow and I don't want her tying one on.
- Who are you meeting with? - The competition.
Can we take a raincheck?
Splendid.
She hasn't changed.
Why are you getting on the elevator going up?
Because the door opened and you were standing there.
I pressed down.
Where have you been?
I missed you.
Working all the time. Don't tell anyone.
Like who?
Arnie's on call Thursday or Friday.
I'll leave a penny under the mat when he's flown the coop.
I have to go.
Can you be more specific?
Nope.
Good night.
Dennis must be doing well.
- That's from the company. - My goodness.
What do you have to do to get this?
Just have a lot of my recruits sell a lot of Mary Kay.
How much? Those are diamonds.
Just has to be the most.
They know what they're doing.
I know. They do.
But there's no way for me to move up there.
So is that why you're going to Avon?
There's women above me at Mary Kay,
It's just working out of Spokane,
there's only so far I can go.
Well, Joanie's a partner and I don't know if anyone
would want all that extra responsibility.
You should visit more often.
Turns out someone's proud of me.
I'm a monster.
Believe it or not, "My daughter is a partner
at a Madison Avenue advertising firm"
is something I enjoy saying.
It does sound pretty good.
Well, so much for keeping my wits about me.
I should be getting back to the Waldorf.
Well, I wish you the best of luck tomorrow.
But if worse come to worse,
you're appreciated somewhere.
What are the "Life" magazine closing dates for Birds Eye?
Ken, it's Monday.
I got a perfect cup of coffee and a Danish on the way.
You want to start with "Good morning? How was your weekend?"
I spent it with my in-laws listening to Ed complain
about how much the world hates Dow Chemical.
And I know that every gripe he has is directed at me and this company.
Is it possible that this has turned Ken Cosgrove into a neurotic?
If he wants people to stop hating him,
he should stop dropping napalm on children.
I know you just came here to complain,
but I actually think that I can help you.
God, that's really true.
I just came in here to complain.
How hard would it be to meet with Ed, just you and me?
If I have a good reason?
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosgrove, but it's the last one.
- Did you find your keys? - I did.
Can you get Pierre Cossette on the line?
I have an idea. Let's see what happens.
Harry has great ideas.
I saw this thing on a spy show.
It's a clock with a tiny camera in it.
All we have to do is get it in there.
If you can get in, you don't need a clock.
I would guess it's a military account.
And I would guess they picked Stan
because he has no conscience.
So Project K stands for what?
Project k*ll Machine!
That's not what it stands for.
So what does it stand for, Bobby?
I don't know what it is.
Are you saying that because you do know what it is?
No.
- Stan come through? - Stan who?
I know one thing-- he's not in a room with tinfoil on the windows.
How are things, Don?
There's nothing in here.
'Cause you're gonna fill it with work.
- If you don't fall asleep. - Mmm.
I'm telling you, it clears the cobwebs.
I think a hot dog and a hamburger are too similar.
Plus, a hot dog cries out for mustard.
No, I think a hot dog cries out for ketchup.
A squiggly line.
Hmm.
I think we should order lunch.
Mmm.
My goodness. Someone's having a party and didn't invite us.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Is Clara's birthday today?
It's tomorrow and it's $2 a head.
And, actually, I don't know what I'm going to get.
- Do you want to come? - I can't.
Mr. Draper always needs me.
Could you punch me out when you leave?
Really?
How long are you going to be gone?
Well, if you punch me out...
Okay.
I heard Mr. Draper's in there.
No.
- Did you get the pages? - No.
Are you two rehearsing already?
Call me when you see them.
Arlene, are you sad it's not you?
You know Mel is my husband.
I could have him write you into a hospital bed
or a grave.
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Well, you're going to have a love scene with Rod.
And between you, me, and soon a national audience,
it's more of a love affair.
Oh, my goodness.
That's so exciting.
Thank you for telling me.
Oh, I did more than tell you.
Mel's been on the fence,
but I think he really believes in you.
Now, don't embarrass me.
You've done this before, haven't you?
Um, well, of course.
Does a high school play count?
No.
It's gonna be exciting at first
and then it'll be part of the job.
It's pretty exciting.
The hard part is how "James Garner" there will deal with it.
Some people think it's better to wait till after it's happened
or not tell them at all, but I think it's best to be up front.
Well, obviously he's not going to like it.
Would you be upset if he did?
I don't know.
Why don't Mel and I take you two out to dinner?
You know, to make him comfortable.
And, honestly, all of us should be better acquainted.
I mean, Mel has big plans for you.
I'm gonna leave you alone with these.
- Did you send Scarlett somewhere? - No, Meredith.
Well, it's just I can't find her or Mr. Crane
and there's someone to see him.
I'm dying for you to meet Ken.
How are you?
Busy.
Have Scarlett see me when you find her.
Oh, good. You're home on time.
I am. It's only because I have a lot of work
and I don't want to do it in a windowless room.
So why don't you have a seat?
I'm gonna get you a drink.
And then I'm gonna stuff you with coq au vin.
I know you're very busy,
but I want us to have, I don't know--
I want us to be able to talk about things other than work.
Megan, what happened?
Just once I'd like to be that wife
that lays a trap and has her husband walk right into it.
Okay, first of all, Arlene,
you know, she plays Penelope Aldridge.
She basically owns "Berkshire Falls."
She's married to Mel the head writer
and they want to have dinner with us.
Does it get worse?
Well, my storyline is getting more developed
and that means
I'm gonna have a series of love scenes.
- With whom? - With Rod Holly.
He plays Rafe Jackson. He's Arlene's nephew.
Megan, I don't care.
What's a "love scene" consist of?
It's just kissing and hugging.
It's TV. We can't really do anything.
What am I supposed to say?
That you trust me.
And that you know it's part of my job.
And maybe that it was bound to happen if things went well.
Keep going. I'm dying to hear what I say next.
Should I have hidden it from you?
I don't know, Megan. I need to think about it.
Look, I know I wouldn't like it,
but I'd look on the bright side.
Okay, I guess if I wasn't your husband,
I would be happy for you.
It does mean they like you.
Do you like me?
Honey, I can tolerate this, but I can't encourage it.
You're perfect.
And, honestly, Ed, it's not just Ken who's been losing sleep about this.
I mean, last week when half of Colombia got into your lobby--
It was 15 people.
Look, you've been in the news every other day
and a couple of articles placed in business journals
are not going to make that stop.
They acted like they were storming the Bastille.
This is their country, too.
What exactly is your point?
Pierre.
A one-hour prime-time TV special sponsored by Dow,
starring Joe Namath and 15 or so of his best friends
putting on a show drawing from America's most beloved musicals.
"Broadway Joe on Broadway."
Joe Namath sings?
Don't you want to watch it just to find out?
And who are his "friends"?
I have access to the greatest talent available.
There'll be sex appeal. Joey Heatherton, for example.
Pipes, Julie Andrews. And punch.
How about John Wayne in a sketch version of "Camelot"?
We're mostly household products.
Women don't like football.
Have you ever asked them about Joe Namath?
Forget demographics.
How would you like Dow to be responsible for making people smile?
And is there anything that makes people smile
more than Broadway and football?
"Yankee Doodle Dandy" and the Notre Dame fight song
playing at the same time.
♪ I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy... ♪
♪ Yankee Doddle, do or die... ♪
Okay, okay.
Kenny, did you tell them I went to Notre Dame?
No, I told them about Joey Heatherton.
So it's tailor-made for us?
What's our commitment?
Well, you'd be a corner tenant.
There's six minutes of commercials in the hour,
you'd get three and then two 10-second billboards
at the beginning and end of the show.
"Brought to you by Dow Chemical,
family products for the American family."
Just imagine Joe Namath in a straw hat.
I'm sorry to bother you, Scarlett,
but is Mr. Crane in?
Okay. No, he's in a meeting.
Is there something I can help you with?
Well, if he's expecting any special guests,
you should let us know because he had someone come yesterday and you weren't here.
I must have been in the ladies' room.
No, and it's strange because you didn't leave until 6:47.
Oh, Joan, it's Clara's birthday today
and I tried to go at lunch, but I got stuck at my desk.
So I left Mr. Crane on his own
while I attended to this company business.
We got her a Givenchy scarf from Gimbels.
I have the card here for you to sign.
But you never came back and you had Dawn punch your time card.
No, Dawn and I were working together.
But we were all over the place.
But mostly in accounting.
Thank you for clearing that up.
Dawn.
Have you spoken to Scarlett this morning?
We're missing the big hole punch and I think you were the last one to see her.
The hole punch is in the creative lounge.
Dawn, Scarlett told me everything.
Scarlett, you're fired.
Joan, please. It won't happen again.
Not here it won't. Go get your things.
Dawn, could you get Stan in here
- before the partners meeting? - I'll deal with you later.
Girls do it all the time.
Just go before you really embarrass yourself.
I hope you realize this means now you're on Ed's radar.
So will I be invited to Sunday dinner?
Something like that.
I don't know where you're going, but I want you to bring back champagne.
Oh, Harry, I'm not coming back.
What are you talking about?
Joan, you owe Scarlett an apology.
Harry, please don't involve yourself in this.
I'm tired of your petty dictatorship.
So whatever capital crime or treason she committed, she's in my department.
I didn't realize you were that attached to Scarlett.
- We're not attached. - We are attached!
I have something more important to do.
I would hope you do, too.
Scarlett, do whatever you think is best.
You are to do whatever I think is best.
Let's go. Back to work.
Everything's fine.
I understand the confidentiality,
but I need to know how to bill Project K.
Don't.
Meredith, why don't you step out?
I don't know what she said because I'm not privy to these conversations,
but I would like the chance to defend myself.
- Mr. Crane, I haven't-- - No, please.
Let him go on.
Well, it's this simple-- Scarlett works for me and Joan tried to fire her.
She left work early and had Dawn punch her time card.
It's pay for a minimum of five hours of work
that she didn't do that we are paying for.
Well, it's either me or her.
- Joan? - Scarlett.
I think you mean, "If she goes, I go."
"Broadway Joe on Broadway."
Is there anybody in here who thought of that?
- I did. - What the hell is that?
It's $150,000 worth of incremental business
I generated while solving a problem. For what?
So I can stand outside that glass and watch you all in here?
- What did Dawn do? - Well, I'm almost positive--
Just keep talking to her because she's a partner.
You know what?
I'm sorry my accomplishments happened in broad daylight
and I can't be given the same rewards.
What is that supposed to mean?
You know damn well.
The next time this group is called to order,
I expect to be sitting at this table.
I've actually earned it.
Don't worry, dear. That's not going to happen.
Joan, I don't want to put myself in the same camp as Harry,
but I might remind you and everyone
the Commission on Human Rights is continuing to investigate
our industry regarding the employment of Negroes.
She's a good secretary.
Of course.
What about Scarlett?
I think this humiliation will suffice.
Can we continue with the billings?
Yes.
Where were we?
"Meredith, why don't you step out?"
Well?
Oh.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't leave.
I don't care as long as you brought those bridal magazines.
What is wrong with you?
I had a day today that pushed your stupid wedding
to the bottom of the list.
- Did you get fired? - No.
I don't think so.
Who can tell at that place?
What happened?
One of the girls asked me to punch out
her time card and we got caught.
I told you, those girls aren't your friends.
Yes, they are. She got in more trouble than me.
Why do you think she asked you?
You can't say no 'cause you're too scared.
All they see is, "Yes, sir."
Everybody's scared there.
Women crying in the ladies' room.
Men crying in the elevator.
It sounds like New Year's Eve when they empty the garbage,
there are so many bottles.
And I told you about that poor man hanging himself in his office.
Oh, they got it so bad,
they must all be jealous of you.
What am I gonna do? Throw a brick through their window?
I want to keep my job,
so I'm gonna keep my head down.
Well, I couldn't do it.
Well, you don't have to.
You're getting married.
And dinner.
I should have brought Dennis.
You're not even listening to me.
I'm sorry. I need a drink
and this place is a soda fountain.
I feel like I'm in high school right down to the clientele.
Hello?
We're sitting here waiting for a phone to ring.
This actually is high school.
So what do you do to have fun?
I don't look in a guidebook.
This wasn't in a guidebook, okay?
My friend told me about it.
Is she a nun or just the right age for this place?
Apparently there are quite a few men here
who go for a certain type.
Oh.
Joanie, don't judge me. I'm in New York.
Good evening, ladies.
If there's anything you need, I'll be over there.
Catherine's got a lot of tables, so don't hesitate.
I'm Leo.
I'm Kate. And this is Joan.
Actually, I don't think our phone is working.
- Can you test it? - I'll see what I can do.
How many girls come in here and complain that their phones are broken?
He's cute. Reminds me of Scotty.
Well, don't marry him.
That was the worst six months of my life.
You always did everything first.
But you did everything smart.
Well, tonight we're just a couple of young secretaries.
Answer it.
Ahem. Hello?
How did you do that?
I didn't do anything. He likes you.
What?
Oh.
Just a minute. Let me ask my girlfriend.
He wants us to meet him after his shift.
Well, tell him you know a place.
But I don't. Do you?
- Should I invite him to my room? - No.
We were just trying to think of a place.
Tell him to think of a place.
Do you know of a place?
Oh, good.
- Hang up. - Till then.
Okay, now I need a drink.
Do you honestly believe a few jokes
on the "Smothers Brothers" are really upsetting people?
I think it's the sponsors and the network
don't want to have a conversation about the w*r.
I'd like to have an evening without a conversation about the w*r.
Darling, you shouldn't smoke so much.
The weight you lose isn't worth the wrinkles.
See, I think the sponsors are for the w*r.
They don't want to have any dissent.
Don, you're a writer. You know this is censorship.
I am a writer and I'm against the w*r,
but when you buy a commercial,
you're hoping that the consumer
is in a good mood when they hear your message.
So if you agree on a wholesome variety show
and all of a sudden it's filled with satire--
the most threatening humor there is--
you're worried about people hating what you're selling.


Megan, let's talk about you
and how you found this man.
I could cast you, you know that.
Yes, I'm sure he is a man who plays many roles.
Luckily you don't have to worry about censorship
with the show because it's so tame.
Of course it's for daytime entertainment.
It's for housewives.
It has to be a little titillating.
We have our own standards.
Although they've been very liberal with us.
But, you know,
when we do things on the show,
it's all very tasteful.
Well, it's not real life.
Why don't you let me get the check?
We go back to our pad, smoke some grass,
and... see what happens.
Sounds like fun.
I don't know. It's late.
It's not.
Look, if you don't smoke grass, that's fine.
It's not everything we had in mind.
I'm not sure if I understand.
We like Megan.
And we like you.
And we'd like to be friends.
Us, too.
Well, then...
I guess it's not impossible under the right circumstances
for us to become better acquainted.
Hey, it may not work. It's a chemistry experiment.
I have a big day tomorrow. You both know that.
That's work. This is play.
I have to get up very early.
That's what black coffee is for.
I make it delicious.
Uh...
maybe another time.
Arlene, we've heard "no" before.
I guess there's no reason to skip dessert.
What?
This is the best seat.
St. Marks between 2nd and 3rd, please.
Have you been to the Electric Circus?
- All the time. - We're from out of town.
Let's see who kisses better.
I'm not playing this game.
Because she'll lose.
What the hell was that?
What? They like you and they like me.
They'd like us to be friends.
They were so out in the open.
It was a good strategy. I kept thinking
he was going to ask me for a job directing commercials.
Maybe he was waiting for tomorrow morning
- when we were basking in the afterglow. - Don't.
Just a pile of arms and legs.
I don't know whether to laugh or be sick
because now I think
that's the reason they gave me the scene.
I'm sure they've tried that
with plenty of people who haven't gotten scenes.
Don, I have to go back to work with them.
It'll be better than ever. How long have they been married?
18 years.
I'm busy.
Come up for air.
Oh, hey.
Would you mind?
This is my friend.
I'm Johnny.
Joan. Pleased to meet you.
Johnny and Joan.
Bonnie and Clyde.
- Do you want a drink? - I have one.
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
What'd I say?
What did he say?
He said I'd want you.
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
♪ Bonnie and Clyde... ♪
Well, w*r or no w*r,
Nixon doesn't think he's running against Johnson.
He thinks he's running against the ghost of Kennedy.
So does Johnson.
I don't know where Helen is.
How are you both this morning?
Frankly, we're a little embarrassed.
Well, if that has anything to do with me, I apologize. That was not my intention.
How are Jennifer, Bea, and the twins?
It's Nathan and Steven, right?
Yes.
They're well, thank you.
That display yesterday of--
well, of initiative
really caught our attention.
This is a check for $23,500.
That's the full commission on "Broadway Joe."
Well, thank you.
That's a lot of money.
So, anything else to say?
I'm puzzled. What do you make a year, Mr. Crane?
22. So what about the partnership?
You want some of the spoils. Well, there you go.
We have to get bigger before we get bigger.
What a load of crap.
- You know, Joan's not even in yet. - Leave her out of this.
Bert, you know how important I am
to this company. You were me.
I was different than you, Mr. Crane, in every way.
- So you don't want the money? - No, I've earned the money.
But I've also earned a partnership.
I really hope some other firm doesn't figure that out first.
That was the most impressive thing he's done.
Should we fire him before he cashes that check?
- Aren't you gonna be late? - Aren't you?
I love you.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
I'm really waking you this time.
Kate.
Honey, wake up.
Now you two layabouts have to bathe him.
I have an appointment.
Mom, I'm still going to work.
Do you need to throw up?
Mother, can you give us a minute?
Why did I do that?
You had some fun.
I just wanted to try it.
Now you'll go home and you'll find everything right where it belongs.
I'm really not you, am I?
Why would you want to be?
Are you kidding?
Look what you did.
You came out here,
you staked this out on your own.
I always had Dennis to fall back on.
Even when I went to Mary Kay.
You didn't.
And I never will.
How'd that happen?
The whole reason I even talked to Avon
is because I wanted...
I don't know,
what you have.
It's not what you think.
You're an executive.
It's a title.
And money.
I've been working there for 15 years
and they still treat me like a secretary.
What's it have to do with them?
You're there, Joan.
And from where I'm sitting, it's damn impressive.
I don't care how they make you feel,
it's right in front of you for the taking.
I'll be back in an hour.
There you go.
Oh.
Okay, I'll draw the bath.
It's clean, it's simple,
and it's tantalizingly incomplete.
What's missing? One thing.
"Pass the Heinz."
You mean the Heinz Ketchup.
It's Heinz. It only means one thing.
It feels like half an ad.
The greatest thing you have working for you
is not the photo you take or the picture you paint.
It's the imagination of the consumer.
They have no budget. They have no time limit.
And if you can get into that space,
your ad can run all day.
Well, Pete, you said I'd say it.
It's pretty bold work.
I think I still want to see our bottle.
I thought that at first, too, but--
We will test it both ways.
It's a testament to ketchup
that there can be no confusion.
Let me chew on it, fellas.
You're going to be thinking of ketchup all day
and you didn't even see it.
Thank you.
We'll be in touch.
Well, hello.
Hello.
Ted, you want to come in?
I hope you left us something.
Good to see you.
It's a bake-off? Since when?
- Come on, Don. - Go wait by the elevator.
Peggy.
So, what's the difference between ketchup and catsup?
Well, catsup has more tomatoes,
comes in a bigger bottle,
is cheaper, but tastes just like ketchup.
Now, we know that's not true,
but that's what your competitors are saying.
Over and over.
And they're selling their watered-down, flavorless sauce
by pretending that they're you.
Makes you angry, doesn't it?
Me, too.
But I always say
if you don't like what they're saying,
change the conversation.
"Heinz. The only ketchup."
Imagine this 40 feet tall
in Times Square.
Ketchup versus catsup--
end of conversation.
- Good morning. - Good afternoon.
Thank you.
Joan, may I have a word?
I'm sorry I was not more forthright with you.
I think it would only be fair if you docked my pay
to cover the hours Scarlett did not work.
Fair to whom? Scarlett?
I don't know. Fair to the company?
This is the key to the supply closet
and this is the key to the time cards.
You will be responsible for monitoring both.
What?
Okay.
- Thank you. - Don't thank me.
You don't understand that this is punishment.
Well, I don't care if everybody hates me here
as long as you don't.
We'll see.
So there's two of us.
We're both the same size agency.
You're not afraid of a little heads-up baseball.
I only did it because no one else was supposed to know.
I think everything should be done in secret.
Lock me in that Project K room, I'll work on anything, Don.
I miss it already.
Mind if we join the Lonely Hearts Club?
Who says we're not celebrating?
J. Walter Thompson. They bought it in the room.
Are you kidding me? We paid for that room.
What do you know?
The biggest agency in the world.
Oh, I'm glad you're here.
See, I just got off the phone with Raymond Geiger
and he said that you were at the Roosevelt
giving a presentation to the ketchup brand manager.
But I said that was impossible because how could that happen
at my firm without me knowing?
Because no one was supposed to know.
Let me get a rye rocks and an Old Spanish.
I'm sorry, Ken. Damn it.
I'll call him. I'll work it out.
Don't bother.
He doesn't even want to give us 90 days.
There's nothing better than being known for your loyalty.
You hear that, Ted?
Vinegars, sauces, and beans is available.
Help yourself. It's a gold mine.
They'd love that.
There's a pie and they slice it into pieces
and they throw the tiniest piece into the yard
and let all the small agencies fight over it.
Speak for yourself.
It was worth the risk.
I think I see a friend.
Please, Rafe, you have a family.
I have a family that ignores me,
that treats me like I've never been there.
But you, you make me feel new again.
I work for you.
And for her.
She's good to me.
Stop fighting.
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
This is your bed you share with her.
I can't.
Rafe, we can't.
Corinne, don't deny this, what's between us.
Don't deny me when I know you feel it too.
I do.
Rafe.
You like to watch, do you?
Oh, Rafe.
And we're clear.
Everyone to the conservatory set.
- Very nice, everyone. - You did great.
Thank you.
Megan, your agent's here.
That was steamy.
So I should go change and we can go.
I'll keep you company.
What are you doing here?
Because you didn't want me to see that?
No, and I don't understand why you'd do that to yourself.
It's a hell of a lot better than letting my imagination run wild.
The first time you come to set is for this?
I've been here for months. What did you think was going to happen?
I didn't expect you to enjoy it.
It's acting, Don.
Were you gonna brush your teeth at least before you came home?
I'm sick of tiptoeing around you every time something good happens to me.
This is my job. No, my career.
You kiss people for money. You know who does that?
You couldn't stop it, so I guess ruining it was enough for you.
Would you rather have not known?
You never watch the show. It'd be like it never happened.
Why don't you have dinner with Arlene and Mel tonight?
They're much more open-minded.
That's been out there all day.
Was it going to be out there all night?
Yes.
- Take that off. - Why?
It doesn't mean anything to you.
It does to you.
It does.
So what do you do when I leave here?
Get on your knees and pray for absolution?
I pray for you.
For me to come back?
No.
For you to find peace.
