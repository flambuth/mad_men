I dont care if its windy or rainy,
theres no reason for a shake roof to failif its laid right.
Except that one.
No flashing around the chimney.Thats gonna cost them.
Go around!
Now, Im gonna push it upto 25 miles an hour.
Thats what were allowed to do here.Youve got to really pay attention.
Fifteen minutes of newsand nothing about the Holy Father.
Hes still dead, Ma.
- The shower cap hold up?- Yes.
Piece of junk.
If you want, Ill have Gerry come overand fix your shower.
It was fixed, but I think Ronnie the supersneaks in and breaks it.
For all I knowhes going through my things right now.
You dont like gettinga little bit of attention?
Anita, this man does not lookthe way you want him to.
Id offer you a room,but since Mom moved in, I dont have it.
I want to move to Manhattan.
Really? Its so far away.
It is far, and I commute almost two hourstotal every day, five days a week.
- Thats an extra week of work each month.- My goodness. I never thought of that.
Pegs, the rents there, theyre outrageous.
I know, but Im already spending a fortunebetween subway fare,
cab fare on late nights,
pantyhose... If I cant find a newspaper,the cane on the seats destroys them.
And itll be easy with that savingsand a roommate.
Jeez Louise,youve really been thinking about this.
Ma, its not good for it!
Why dont you move in hereand we send her to Manhattan?
You gonna be one of those girls?
I am one of those girls.
Well, Ho-Ho, I observed your wishesfor secrecy, but now is the time.
Gentlemen.
Imagine the perfect mixture of athletics,spectacle and speed.
Jai alai.
Jai alai is like handball,only you fling the ball
and catch the ball with this basket thing.
Its more complicated than that.And dangerous.
Ill leave the loose-leaf, but it showsthe way jai alai attendance is growing.
In seven years, itll eclipse baseball.
Go ahead, you can laugh,
but its got the same fingerprint as baseball,only better.
A special stadium called a fronton,
and you can sit real close, which is a thrillbecause the ball goes 175 miles an hour.
And its got Patxi.Hes Babe Ruth, only handsome.
This is Patxi.
I was looking for boxers,but I bought his contract instead.
- Hes the greatest player in the world.- Mel Ferrer.
Im terrified of him catching ballsin the face.
So, lets say theres enough money.
How would you chop it up?
Well, most of its goingto end up in television.
Perfect, because I want a TV show.
- A sports show?- Did you see Patxi?
You dont see him flying around the world,solving crimes and banging broads?
Harry has excellent relationshipswith the networks.
- Well, itll probably have to be ABC.- No, no.
I want to be on all the networks, like whenthe President addresses the nation.
Tuesday night, 8:30 to 9:00,all three networks, the same show.
- No ones ever done it.- Because...
Thats true.
How about a star-studdedbig musical special with a jai alai match.
- Desi Arnaz.- What else you got?
- Well, theres print.- Womens magazines.
A glamorous night in Miamiwith a free admission.
- Tuesday night is ladies night.- And, of course, newspapers are key,
but you cant limit yourselfto less than 10 markets.
This is impressive.
- Dont get up.- Horace, this is Don Draper.
- I told you hed be stopping by.- Well, dont let me interrupt.
So far, for the jai alai campaign,
Sterling Cooper will producean adventure program
starring your handsome fellow,a musical spectacular...
On all three networks,and it has to be in color.
CBS doesnt have color.
Fine. Id like to getthe ladies magazines in color,
and maybe a color pagein the Sunday paper.
- What about radio?- Youll have to take radio the way it is.
I dont think its worth anyones timeunless youre willing to commit to at least
- $1 million, to start.- Sure, but thats a third of my ad budget.
Well, as they used to sayat the freshmen mixer,
- "When you get a yes, you go home. "- Only, Humps, you never got one.
Listen, Draper, Id love to buy you dinner,run some slogans by you.
Actually, Ho-Ho, we buy you dinner.
That was fun.
Im going to have to buy Campbella case of something.
Patxi.
During the Depression, I saw somebody
throw a loaf of breadoff the back of a truck.
It was more dignified.
Are you going to have troublesleeping tonight?
Ive seen clientsfar more defenseless than he.
Well, as the Bible says,"Enjoy your fatted calf. "
Campbell, did you tell himwho this idiots father is?
He said hes a shipping magnate,not a client.
Horace Sr. Is connected to Bert Cooperin a million ways,
and I dont know if he would likewhat just happened in there.
You want to run it by his daddy?
Hes my age.So he was born with a lot of money.
He has a dream,and its our job to make it come true.
Well, there you have it.
Nicely done, my boy.
Elizabeth. Get off your feet.Its bad for the baby.
- As soon as I finish the dishes.- Sit with me.
Cleaning up for the maid.Youre just like your mother.
I dont like watching you commit su1c1de.Neither do your kids.
What do you want, Daddy?
Its all laid out in here,
my arrangements.Just follow the directions.
I dont want to talk about this.
We talk about it now and thenwe dont talk about it. Thats the idea.
- Fine.- Jesus. Smoke your cigarette.
Funerals are a dishonest business.
People dont want to think about it.Thats how they get you.
Remember what happenedwith your mother?
The wills translucent or transparentor something according to the lawyers.
You run the show.
- You took me in.- Anything else?
I want you to have your mothers coats.
I gave Judy the Hudson seal,but I want you to have the chinchilla
and obviously the mink.
Theyre in the cedar closet.They keys in Glorias end table.
Okay, Daddy.
You dont want to hear about it,Scarlett OHara?
I have the folder.
Youve always been sensitive.Thats my fault for shielding you
from all the dangers out there.Thats probably why you married this joker.
If youd even known what was possible...
But thats that. I wrote it down.We never have to talk about it again.
I dont understandwhy you like talking about this
when you can see so clearlythat it upsets me.
Youre being selfish and morbid.
Im your little girl.
And I know it must be horribleto be looking at whatever youre looking at,
but cant you keep it to yourself?
- What kind of mood is he in?- Im never right.
- Anybody been outside? Do I need a coat?- Id take it.
Don, George Caan dropped out of Patioto direct a picture in LA.
I look forward to his average work.Replace him.
Theres no time and theres no talent.
What were you gonna doif you had to fire him?
- Have Sal do it.- Are you serious?
- Sal, do you want to do it?- Of course I do.
It sounds good,but it makes me very nervous.
Its lifted straight from Bye Bye Birdie.Its a single sh*t.
Sal did the storyboards. I could go on,but I dont think I should have to.
- Allison?- Keens chophouse.
Thank you, Don.
Tag. Youre it.
Hey. You dont wantto cut towards yourself.
There we go. Get down.Ive got some great things in here.
This is an exact imitationof the Gettysburg Address.
- You know about Honest Abe?- He learned to read by candlelight.
Thats right.
Well, Ill be.
Don, look at this.
Victory medal, France.
I should have another for b*at the clap.
Here we are.
Wow!
That spike, its Prussian.
Germanys greatest soldiers.You had to respect that.
Thats where I got him.
- You see that? Dried bl*od.- You sh*t him?
I think so. I sh*t lots of them.They were trying to k*ll us.
- w*r is bad.- Maybe,
but it makes a man out of you.
Living off the land, battling the elements,standing alongside your brothers.
- Ask your pop.- Gene.
- What?- Gene, dont.
- Come on.- Bobby, give it back.
Let him have it! Thats why I got it!
- Cant I have it?- There was a person in that helmet.
- An enemy.- Bobby, its a dead mans hat. Take it off.
Keep it on. Its yours.
There was this girl...
You like? It was on sale at A&S.
Looks like a lot more than 20% off.
Kitty.
Kitty.
Im working.
- Somethings wrong, isnt it?- No.
No, no, no, dont say that. Dont say that.
- Im not myself.- What does that mean?
Why are men so embarrassedto share their emotions?
Please. Sal...
The past few months... Somethings wrong.
- Well, thats not true.- It is true.
You know, I dont need that much, but...
I do need tending.
- Im so sorry.- Well, what can I do?
You wont even tell me.
Make some excuse.
For the last six months, maybe a year, even,Ive watched my job disappear.
Nobody wants illustrations anymore.Its all about photography.
And yes, Ive been nervous.
And now I have this opportunity
to do somethingthat really does have a future.
So its been building to this,and tomorrow you will triumph
and come home a conquering hero.
- Whats wrong with you?- Well, I do have one horrible flaw.
I love you.
I dont want to fail.
Just... With a single mistake,the entire sh*t is ruined.
So what? Youve seen the movies.Take two. Take three. Do it again. Action.
Its one sh*t, the whole thing.
- Its the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.- Im trying to remember.
She starts singingagainst a blue background,
and her voice is very girlish.
- Yes. Yes, I remember that.- And shes offering us this can of Patio.
And shes on a treadmill,but you cant see it.
- Shes walking back and forth?- No, no. She walks towards you.
The wind is blowing in her hair,
and she sings abouthow Patio is low in calories.
And then she extends her hand outand she waves goodbye.
Then we move back, too,
but she stops,and she takes her dress in her hands
and she runs forward as fast as she can.But then she turns her back
and looks seductively over her shoulder.
The treadmill pulls her back againand she comes towards you one last time,
dancing right up to the camera.She sort of pushes her shoulders together
and leans over with the canand she smiles. "Hello, Patio. "
Something like that.
Sound good?
Youre gonna do great.
- You really think so?- Yes.
Don, Id like you to meet Horace Cook.
- Weve met. Lincoln Center.- Of course.
Have a seat.Lane has brought it to my attention
that Mr. Cooks sonhas approached us for work.
Actually, it was Don who thought it best,out of deference, to include you.
Were not psychiatrists.There is no confidentiality.
Thats not strictly true, but you are familyand, well, it appears to be a lot of money.
Bert seemed alarmed.What exactly happened in this meeting?
- Well, you know, your son has a dream.- Yes, jai alai.
When he first mentioned itI assumed he was gambling,
but he seems convincedof its financial potential.
And theres no reason to doubt that.
Are you drunk? Its like Polish handball.You cant even play it if youre left-handed.
Theres no wall on that side.
Well, then, thats done with.We neednt be involved.
Bert, you know thats not the waythe marketplace works.
A man comes through your door,
he knows what he wants,hes got the money to back it up,
- you do your best.- Perhaps Im unclear
because Im childless, but theyre not.
Well, should you be lucky enoughto strike gold,
remember that your children werent therewhen you were swinging the pick.
Ive seen his plan. Its gibberish.
But if you refuse him,hell only find someone else.
My son lives in a cloud of success,
but its my success.
Perhaps when that evaporatesand his face is pressed
against the reality of the sidewalk,hell be of value to someone.
"k*ll or be k*ll, eat or be eaten. "
Thats how I was raised.
So you want us to proceed?
When we put that money aside for him,he was a little boy.
We didnt knowwhat kind of person we were making.
Dont be so hard on yourself.
Easy for you to say.He doesnt have your name.
Youll stay for lunch. No discussion.
A pleasure to see you again.
Pleasure.
- Ill sign him tonight.- Very good.
These are ideas.
You can skip some if you want to,but do not go out of order.
Hello, this is Margaret.
Hello, my name is Elaine and Im 22,
and I have a good joband Im interested in a roommate, too.
Well, its nice to speak with you, Elaine.Where do you work?
Well, I live in Teaneck, New Jersey,
so I want to be in this cityto be near my job.
- I work in a tannery on the West Side.- Really? They make leather?
Im a secretary,
but I am around animal skins and carcassesmost of the day,
so I dont keep pets.The smell makes them go crazy.
I dont know if the West Sideis what I had in mind.
I need someplace near a major hospital.
My face is very badly b*rned
and I need frequent prescriptionsfor unguents and salves.
- It would have to be two bedrooms.- Two bedrooms is good.
Now, about the bathroom,
Im going to need some help there.
Who is this?You know something? Youre a jerk.
- Why do you do that?- Ive got a salt tooth.
- Its right here in the back of my mouth.- Grandpa.
Its getting harder to fool you.I got two spoons.
Mommy doesnt let ushave ice cream before dinner.
Is she afraid youre going to be fatlike she was?
Your grandma Ruth used todrive her to town to run errands
and make her walk herself home.That put a stop to it.
- You remember Grandma Ruth?- She gave me a ukulele.
- Did you learn it?- No.
You can, you know. Youre smart.
You remind me of your grandmamore than your mother.
You know, she did draftingin the 20s for this engineer.
- A little bald man. He wasnt a threat.- Thats good.
You can really do something.Dont let your mother tell you otherwise.
You know, she wont let me eat this either,and I dont want to be the only one,
so Ill tell you what.Im gonna keep a lookout.
Okay. Go ahead. The coast is clear.
- Shes coming! Quick, hide it!- I knew you were gonna do that.
This tastes like chocolate,but it smells like oranges. You smell that?
A year from now therell be nothingbut rum and Mexican beer in this place.
- You ever have Mexican beer, Humps?- I dont drink a lot of beer.
You have to when youre there.Amoeba, dysentery.
Patxi caught a bug, lost eight pounds.Thats a lot on his frame.
Ho-Ho was saying a photo of Jack Kennedyenjoying jai alai
would be a tremendous endorsement.
My father hates Kennedy,
cause he knew Old Joewhen they were criminals together.
Plus, Dads against integration.He called Patxi a w*tback.
Jack Kennedy certainly ended upwith a better job than his father.
I know this idea sounds crazy,but read your history.
Ive got a 50% chance, at least.
My fathers dead,but I know hed be interested.
This is his kind of investment.
I think about the waymy father made his fortune,
renting ships for troop transportduring the w*r.
He didnt care about the Germans.
And then I think,I could really do something.
I might not be president, but I could...I could build something.
And people will like it,and Im going to be the father of this sport,
and people are gonna be dyingto do business with me, even my father.
I have this image in my mind.
Its his 75th birthday,
and I give him a team.
I want to give you a piece of advice.
Ive been doing this a while,and I applaud your enthusiasm,
but I think you should take this decisiona little more seriously.
- What are you saying, Don?- Let him... Let him talk.
You have a great fortune,and thats not just money. Thats the future.
And we will take all of your money,I promise you,
but I think you should reevaluatethis particular obsession.
You can do better.
Thats a sales technique, isnt it?
You zig away from meand I zag back into your arms.
You know,Ive got the galleys of this book by Ogilvy.
Learned a lot about advertising.
Then why arent you eating dinnerwith Ogilvy?
Cause Campbell talked me out of it.
Now lets get one thing straight.
If jai alai fails, its your fault.
Im sorry, but thats the way it is.
Dont apologize. Everybody thinks that.Nobody says it.
Are you removing that or moving it?
Did everybody in Manhattan decideIm not allowed to live here?
No. Actually, I think the right girlcould have a very good effect on you.
I do, however, find your ad unfortunate.
Its perfect. I proofed it thoroughly.
"Clean, responsible, considerate.
"I have some nice furnitureand a small television. "
It reads like the stage directionsfrom an Ibsen play.
So what, then? Youll give me some ideas,
and Ill use them,and youll all have an even bigger laugh?
No, I thought Id tell youhow to get a roommate.
This is not the way.
Fine.
Please, Joan, tell me how to do it.
- For one thing, why "Margaret"?- Its my name and its more adult.
But this is about two young girlsin Manhattan. This is about an adventure.
Am I wrong?
If this were me, I would say something like,
"Fun-loving girl, responsible sometimes.
"Likes to laugh. Lives to love.
"Seeks size six for city livingand general gallivanting.
"No dull moments or dull men tolerated. "Or something like that.
Well, thank you. Thats very helpful.
And dont put it up there.Everyone here knows you.
Branch out.
Good night, Peggy.


Don. There you are.
I was just on my way over to Lane.Ive got signatures.
Horace Cook, Jr. Is all dressedand ready for the oven.
In light of all of the trepidation,
perhaps you should deliver thisto Lane yourself.
- Are you following me?- I spent two years at Dartmouth
hiding him from shylocks.Let me enjoy my payday.
Mr. Hooker,has Lane stopped by the clubhouse?
Ill go and get him.
Thats called a cesta.Its made of reeds from the Pyrenees.
The ball is called a pelota.They just sent all this over.
So did Horace have any more ideas?
For one thing,he wants us to call it the NJAA.
National Jai Alai Association?
He has no idea how confusedAmericas gonna be about that "J."
Look at this camaraderie.
Perhaps weve discoveredAmericas pastime after all.
Full steam ahead.
- Bravo, boys.- How about Patxi: The Motion Picture?
God, I wish I was a part of this.
Ive informed the home office.There was a flutter of adding machines.
Well, you heard him, boys.
Dont stop until you see the whitesof his pockets.
Cosgrove.
Good God.
Bill it to the kid.
- What the hell is that?- Its an English muffin.
The hell it is. Put it away.You can eat at school.
I already ate my breakfast.
Well, dont keep me waiting this afternoon.
I want you dressed and ready for balletat 3:00 on the button.
- No dawdling.- Okay.
Im gonna buy fruit. What do you want?
- Peaches, please.- Peaches give me a rash.
Your sister likes them.
Are you Peggy?They just sent me back from reception.
- Im Karen Ericson.- Yes, I am. How nice to finally meet you.
You have your own office.Wowee! At the travel agency, it takes years,
and Martha Winstons the only girl,and shes married to the boss.
Well, its different up here.
Everyone on the first floorloved your humorous ad.
You seem like someoneI could really be friends with,
not like the last girl.
Well, Im fun and I love to have fun.
She was always keeping her door shut,
and I think you should only close your doorfor one reason.
Whats that?
I just dont get along with womenlike I do men,
but she left to get married,so I must be some kind of good-luck charm.
- Do you have a steady?- No, Im still playing the field.
There are so many interesting menout there. Except sailors.
I have a couple of rules.One of them is I dont like sailors.
- No sailors. I agree.- So, Peggy Olson, I have to ask,
- are you Swedish? Because I am.- Norwegian.
Well, we wont tell my parents.
Ill make appointments and come by at 5:00.Or do you want your girl to do it?
I finish up around 6:00.
- Well, then tomorrow?- Most days.
Can we look on Saturday?
- But not this Saturday...- You work on Saturday?
Not every Saturday.And Saturday nights never.
Im out in the city, ready for fun.
Well, okay. Ill call you, roomie.
I got you a sandwich.
- Im gonna walk around the park.- Well, have fun, roomie.
Its Mommy.
- Wheres Grandpa Gene?- It mustve slipped his mind.
- Where is he?- Probably at home.
Im sure hell be there when we get home.
Bye, bye, sugar

Hello, Patio
Hello, Patio
Hello, Patio
- I cant even tell you how thorough Sal was.- Well, I appreciate that, but this is...
I dont know.This is not what I thought it was gonna be.
Glad Im not alone.
Look, I dont think theres any ambiguityabout this being exactly,
and I mean exactly, what you asked for.
I know,but theres something not right about it.
- What?- I cant put my finger on it.
- I wish I could, but I cant.- Its an exact copy, frame for frame.
Ill tell you what. Why dont we send a dupeback to the office with you?
No. Im sorry.
I wish I could explain it,but its just not right.
Im gonna be magnanimousand say its our idea and our failure,
but it is a failure.
That is magnanimous.
- Im sorry about that.- Maybe next time.
Its true. Its not right.It doesnt make any sense. It looks right,
it sounds right, smells right.Somethings not right. What is it?
Its not Ann-Margret.
Mommy, theres a policeman! Hurry!
Yes, may I help you?
- Are you related to Eugene Hofstadt?- Yes, I am. What is it?
We regret to inform youthat he passed away.
- Oh, God.- No! No!
Im fine.
- What happened?- He collapsed in line at the A&P.
Im so sorry, maam.
I...
I...
Well, we need to knowwhat youd like to do with his body.
Yes, of course.
- Mr. Romanos here to see you.- Send him in.
I figured Id bring myself to the woodshed.
It must be horriblehaving a client insist on something
and then change their mindonce theyve seen it.
- I hope it never happens to me.- I was the director and I let you down.
- Im in a meeting.- I have Mrs. Draper on the line.
- Its urgent.- I can go.
Whats the matter?
Im sorry, Betts.
Im...
Im very sorry.
Do you want me to call William?
Just stay put. Ill be right there.
- I have to go.- Is everything okay?
Theres nothing you can do.
Dont ruin the only good thingto come of this.
You are now a commercial director.
How do I know youre not just saying thatto make me feel better?
Youll know when I hire you again.
Allison, Im going for the day.
Okay, Ma.
Oh, my goodness. Its beautiful.
Is that all the noise that this was?Why didnt you wait for Gerry to help?
Because hes playing cardsand Peggy gets up early.
- Say thank you, Ma.- Thank you, sweetheart.
An Admiral. You must be doing well.
- I am.- Whats the matter, peaches?
Sit down, Ma.
Whats this about?
Dont, Anita. Stay.
Ma, Im having problems with my apartment,
and my commute is very long and...
It doesnt mean nothingif you want to stay here with us.
Your father and I livedwith grandma and grandpa for years.
Your sister was born there.
Ma, Im getting an apartment in Manhattan.
- Well, that makes sense.- It really does.
Yeah, I guess Im the kind of mother
whod rather have a new TVthan a daughter.
I got you a new TVbecause you needed one.
You got me a new TVcause you think I was born yesterday.
You belong in the city.
Do you see this, Anita?This is what they do. Family is cheap.
Well, take it back, okay?
Because its just going to remind meof how stupid you think I am.
Ma! You knew shed haveto move there eventually.
Now, someday both of youare going to feel this,
this... This broken heart Im carrying.
Youll get r*ped, you know that?
Its just as dangerous as here,and Im going to have a roommate.
Shes a nice girl. Her nameis Karen Ericson. Shes Norwegian.
- Theres a man, isnt there?- No.
Why would I ever believe anything you say?
Stop it, Ma. Youre being cruel.
Good night, Ma.
- That wasnt so bad.- Really?
Shes been through a lot of change lately.
The Holy Father dying,that was very hard on her.
It has become one country
because all of usand all the people who came here
had an equal chanceto develop their talents.
We cannot say to 10% of the populationthat you cant have that right,
that your children cant have the chanceto develop whatever talent...
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.
Eugene Hofstadt, number two.
What does that mean?
There were two Eugene Hofstadtsat his bank,
so he had to be called Eugene Hofstadt,number two.
Well, hes with Ruth now.
I hope so.
Once he asked,
"Whats gonna happen when I get to heavenand I have two wives?"
Knowing Gloria,I dont think thats gonna be a problem.
Betts, dont eat that.It was in his car all day.
I dont care.
- Why are you laughing?- Sally, sweetheart...
- We werent laughing, honey.- I heard you. I heard you laughing.
How can you be sitting therelike nothings happening?
Like hes not gone?He was here, now hes not here.
Hes gone foreverand nobody even knows that.
Stop it.
- Youre being hysterical. Calm down.- Hes dead!
Hes dead and hes never coming back!And nobody cares
- that hes really, really, really gone!- Sally, go watch TV!
