I lay on my pillowat the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
Delicious and destroyed.
Inhaling the fragranceof the sheets.
Feeling the warmthof where you were just laying.
You make me new with laughter.
You make me old with wisdom.
You make wine taste sweeter.
Who wrote that?
I write a lot of poetrywhen Im inspired.
I guess I shouldnt be surprisedby anything you do.
You shouldnt.
Its insulting.
I have to keep you in line,or Ill lose you.
Yes, you will.
I dont like the ideaof making you older.
I just meant...
I dont know.
It doesnt matter how old I am.
Our souls are the same age.
Oh, God.
Youre getting to me.
How do I know Im not just goingto eat another mushroom and
this room will disappearand Ill be back on a train to Trenton?
Because I love you, Jane.
This is hard for you.I know it.
You dont want meto talk about it, but
Margaret and Mona have beenyour life for the last 40 years.

Listen,
Im not being impulsive, becauseIve been thinking about this all the time.
I want you to be my wife.

Well, if youll all swearGillette dropped in.
Are you kidding?
Absolutely.
Ill pretend theyre hereif you give me some actual ideas.
Right Guard already hasa great campaign, men being men.
You know, women smell bad, too.Not you, of course.
- Women have perfume.- "Perfume does not fight wetness."
Loretta Young.Shes my dads favorite.
The aprons.
The nauseating upholstery on the couch.Strangers who drop by.
- Hear from Kinsey?- What do you mean?
Did you read whatsgoing on down there?
In this day and age.
The papers said its goingto be Little Rock all over again.
I dont know why peoplekeep stirring up trouble.
Its bad for business.Just another reason not to watch TV.
- Kurt doesnt even have one.- You have to have one. Its your job.
Youre going to miss the playoff.
Its a different lifefor single men.

The convention doesnt startfor another day.
You want to be the hundredth personto shake someones hand at some convention?
For what, a free pen?

Take your list, target some of these guys,and make them feel special.
Didnt Roger give you leads?
He did.
Im going to need sunglasses.
Come on.
You wanna be on vacation, Pete?Cause I can make that happen.
Old-fashioned.
Excuse me.
My friends and I havebeen speculating about you,
trying to decide who you areand what you do.
Why?
Are you an actor?
- No.- Are you an astronaut?
No.
Someone over there would liketo meet you, a young woman,
only if you werenone of these things.
Im Vicompte Monteforte dAlsace.
- Willy.- Don.
This is Don.
Shes been staring at you all day.
Cant stop talking about you.
Im Joy.
Oh, and this is Rocci.
You look so
comfortable aloneby the pool all day.
I wonder if youre waitingfor someone.
I am.
Hmm.
Do you smell that jasmine?
Mmm. Dine with us.
- Maybe another time.- Well. That never happens.
Hello.
Pete, this is Joy and Rocciand Vicompte Monteforte.
Very good.
DAlsace. Willy.
Thats quite a name.Peter Dykeman Campbell.
Have we met somewhere?Newport?
I have a terrible memoryfor faces.
Nice meeting you.
Yes.
A pleasure to meet you.
Look for us.
Everybody hereis late for everything.
Oh. I just saw Tony Curtisin the mens room.
Handing out towels?
Tony Curtis, Don.
A thing like that.
- Whos for dinner?- Rodney Barnes.
Classic salesman turned executive.And this interesting scientist,
Caleb Sawyer.
He has this "optiman" thesis.
In addition to rockets,
theyre going to start engineering man,you know, for travel in space.
Uh, new organs, super strength.
You know the Sovietsare working on it.
Are all of our meetings like this?
Its American Aviationand Rocketdyne.
Its not a joke.
Can I get a drink here or what?
Raphael was a little tired.
But the Fifth Arrondissementhas most of your good restaurants.
Of course, we kept getting lost, andevery time Sherry asked for directions,
it turned out to beanother American.
Well, there you go. Ill take Janeto Paris, and Ill send Mona to Reno.
You dont have tomarry her, do you?
No.
Maybe you and Mona could work outone of those modern arrangements.
George, stop.
It is possible that youll get tiredof her, and then where will you be?
Mona doesnt have a right
to anything not my company money,not my family money.
Shes lucky Im giving her anything.You know what?
Weve been miserable for years.I dont want to die with that woman.
Calm down.
I didnt know that.
This is the lifeI was always meant to have.
Congratulations.
Mona has the marriage license,and she was to hurt you.
If you want to be withthis 20-year-old girl,
youre going to have to buy it from her.And I have to warn you.
Women in this situationbecome extra irrational.
Well, how badlydoes she want to hurt me?
I have a list of conditionsand an alimony that could
support Rita Hayworth.
Think of all the good thingsin life and cut them in half.
I want you to push as hard as you can,but I want it done.
Mr. Phillips is here.
In a minute.
Ill proceed.
But I want you to think about it.
Duck Phillips,this is George Rothman.
Actually, we know each other.
Roger.
Its good to see you, Duck.
Was he for you or against you?
Hes supposed to be the best.Him or Marvin Hughes.
Thats who Mona has.
Hes her cousin.
How bad was it?Do I want to know?
I dont think my circumstanceswere the same as yours.
What can I do for you?
Actually, this might not bethe best time to talk about this.
Cant you tell Id welcomea change in subject?
Well, good, then.
What the hell, right?
Listen, were coming upon two years together here.
Did you get me something?
I think were at a point in time
where I need to knowwhat your plans are.
A partnership.I think Ive earned it.
Right.
Ill bring it up at the nextmeeting of the partners.
Thank you.
Of course you might have to come inand be an advocate for yourself.
Id be proud to presentmy accomplishments.
Good. Because Im at a loss.
What is that supposed to mean?
You havent exactly deliveredon that 30% you promised.
I think weve really performedin a very dismal year.
These things are cyclical.You know that.
Is there some questionabout my value to Sterling Cooper?
Just think about the board.Bert Cooper hates everyone,
and his sister, well,she does whatever he says.
Don...
Don... hes only 121/2%, but I cant sayhes your biggest cheerleader.
- What are you saying?- Everyone thinks youre a fine fellow.
But if I were you,
Id go out there and make rain.
Thank you for being so candid.
This year
we have seen an historic collaborationin American aerospace.
Building on Lockheedsnew Polaris A3,
Bell Aerosystems,Areojet General, and NASA
have developeda restartable rocket engine.
Can we get the lights, please?
We at Space Technology Laboratories
have set our mindsto the challenges of the future.
In July,
Khrushchev said the Soviet Unionnow has an m*ssile
that can hit a fly in outer space.
Space Technology Laboratories
is leading a coordinated effort
to create an invulnerable warhead...
multiple, independently targetable
re-entry vehicles, MIRVs.
And North American Aviations vernierthruster allows the primary m*ssile
to correct its trajectory beforesh**ting off several warheads
hidden inside its nose cone.
The MIRV can be launched from a submarineor land into the stratosphere.
Then it splits offinto 14 individual warheads.
Thats 14 different targets.
14 different cities.
14 individual warheads,
each with ten timesthe payload of Nagasaki.
Even if Khrushchev hits 35%,
thats 5 out of 14.
Secondary strike capabilitieswill be extremely limited...
... due to the decreasein infrastructure and population.
Total annihilation.
Do you realize that one of thesecompanies spends more annually on media
than three Lucky Strikes?
Its a gold rush.
Where are the valets?
So much for cheap labor.
Go see if General Dynamicsb*at us here.
Drop these by the front desk.
You dont want themunder your arm.
Hello.
I think youre happyto see me.
Well, take a good look.I have to be on my way.
Are you working?
Yes.
Oh. Thats too bad.Im going to Palm Springs.
You should come with me.
I dont know about that.
Why would you deny yourselfsomething you want?
You want to get your things?
No.
Well.
Why dont we give it a few more minutes?Enjoy the scenery.
Order some drinks.
I think Don needto make a phone call.
Hello?
Just leave the bags there.
- Who lives here?- Friends. Theyre in Sardinia.

Its medicinal.
Alguien importante?
Good-bye, Carlos.
Come for a swim with me?
You can go inside and ask for sometrunks, or you can goau naturel.
I think I should... go inside.
Youre white as a sheet.
Don, are you okay?
Where am I?
Youre with me, remember?
You have heat exhaustion.
- What are you doing?- Its fine. Its medicine.
Klaus is a doctor.
No. Its okay. I just needsome water and some aspirin.
Everybody out.
I thought you weregoing to break your neck.
Next time you feel faint,lean towards the pool.
See you at dinner.
Little girl, dont get any ideas.
This man needs rest.
I found you some clothes upstairs.
Who are these people?
Theyre friends.
Were nomads together.
What are you all doing here?
Theres an open door policy.
You should rest up for dinner.Have you ever had Mexican food?
- No.- Youre going to like it.
Come out when youre ready.
Youre spoiled. This is great food.This is Mexican.
Its not. I dont like Mexican.I wanted the French again.
Sweetheard.
Mexican does pig. I dont eat pig.Ive already told you.
Okay, well.

Klaus, will you let Don sit here?
Would you like some wine, Don?
- Klaus, is that okay?- Hmm, he looks healthy enough.

Joy and Willy thinkthat youre a spy.

Youll never meet a group peoplemore interested in professions, and yet
there is not one of us herewho has one.

But you dont work.
So I assume youre all well off.
I should take something up. Im smarterthan Ive ever been in my life.
Not only do I know so much,

Hello, all.
How the hell was California?
Looks like Draperlet you off the leash.
Did you see this?
Yes, I did. Strange, isnt it?
Americans are free in short
to disagree with the law,but not to disobey it.

Spectacular, business-wise, but Idont know that Id want to live there.
Here. These are for everybody.
Id like to see it for myself.
Whats wrong with it?
The people.
I dont know.
Im glad to be home.

could long deny that man...
You look different.
Its my hair.
Right.
Kurts a h*m*.

No.
So? What, then?
What if I told you thatthe international divisions

and Chrysler can allbe part of Sterling Cooper?
How is that possible?
St. John Powell,
of Putnam, Powell, and Lowe,called me the other day.
They want to open up a New York officeto deal with their American clients.
They love the idea of just stickinga key in the door at Sterling Cooper.
Really?
Is this as solidas American Airlines?
I guess youre happy having to scrambleon the third tier of this industry
waiting for minor divisionsof major companies to drop in your lap.
On the table will bemountains of money,
international prestige,
a chance at going public,and we dont have to change our name.
- I guess we could think about it.- No.
I need to knowthat youre open to this.
If so, Im giving themfive business days to try to impress us
with a price for controllinginterest in the agency.
There he is.
Theres the manI heard so much about.
Five days to make an offer.
Or you can give me a priceand Ill pass it on.
