The good news iswere going to be out of your hair.

Bikinis that match the drinks and new copy.Something cute.
"Its Bacardi-licious. "
"Its Bacardi-lightful. "
Were supposed to sit hereand pretend like were on vacation?
- Theyre probably drinking mint juleps.- Booze puts me to sleep.
I will take grass any hour of the day.It helps me think.
When I was at Princeton,I wrote my senior thesis
on the passions of the Stoics.
Mary Jane was my muse.
Paul helps me sleep.
Peggy, go get a blender.Maybe we can turn this into a frapp?.
- You get it.- Im eating.
Olive?
- What are you doing here?- Well, if youre working, Im working.
- Its okay for you to go home.- I already canceled my plans.
Phil and I were going todrive up to The Cloisters.
And Steven, my son,hes at Boston College.
He was thinking of coming downwith his girlfriend,
but Im not sure thats working out.Hes picky.
Anyway, so Phils taking a trip to the dump,and here I am, no worse for wear.
Dont I seem as important as Cosgrove?
I mean, Campbell makes sense,to the manner born.
- So you like to get high?- Whenever I can.
My cousin used to know someone,but he got married.
Whos your friend?
A guy like you?There must be somebody you can call.
Yeah. No. Of course.
Sally, get up here.
I just walked backwardsall the way from the living room.
Zip.
You look pretty.
I look like an open umbrella.
Grandpa says youre going to a soir?e.
Dont bother him.
Go watch TV.
- Grandpa?- Im indisposed.
What are you doing?Youre going to break it.
- Who told you that?- Ive done it.
If it happens, Ill go get my littlescrewdriver and put on a new one.
Jesus, I stink.
I can finish up out here.You take a nice, long bath.
No. No, no, no.Ettinger goes at the head of the table.
Hes the chief of surgery.Its where he always sits.
Not in your home, Greg.Host at the head, hostess at the foot
or whichever is nearest to the kitchen,
- and then its boy, girl, boy, girl.- Who says?
Emily Post. Everyone.
Ronald Ettinger does not read Emily Post.Hes going to expect to sit there,
and hes going to expect meand Rick Stolich to be his footstools.
Well, I wont have their wives think
you have a wife who doesnt knowhow to set a table.
Joanie, I dont wantto have a fight right now.
Then stop talking.
A buffet would be slightly more casualand people could sit where they will.
And we could put the chafing dishthat they gave us right in the middle.
Perfect.
Hey.
...urged by Republicansto appoint a special prosecutor
to investigate the scandal-riddenState Liquor Authority.
The governor has expressed confidence...
Carla.
Carla?
Is she here?
Look at you.
I know I look good for my condition,but Im still in my condition.
- Did they leave yet?- No, I think theyre in the living room.
Well, Ive been robbed.
I had it right here and now I dont.
Daddy, what are you talking about?
I had $35. Now I have $30.

Daddy, you know how forgetful you are.
Im missing $5.
Ill give you $5.
Don, will you give him something?
- Here, Gene. Here you go.- No, I dont want your money.
You people, you think moneyis the answer to every problem.
No, just this particular problem.
Daddy, Im sorry.I dont know what you want.
I want my $5!
Well, I think I am finally ready to go.
Come on, lets go out in the yard.
I forgot how many tourists there arein midtown.
Theyre like vermin.
Jeffrey, this is my colleague Smitty.
- How you doing, Jeff?- Not bad. Not bad at all.

Ive got Dexies, Benzedrine strips, boo.

Youre looking at the two great cocksmenof Princeton 55.
The times you must have had.Can we buy some dope?
Ill give you all four for $10, plus delivery.
Im just kidding, but I should.I mean, you never call me.
Whens the last time I saw you?
- Give me your sweater.- Its mohair.
- May I?- Relax. Sit down.
You ever look out this window?
Its beautiful.
Nice to see you both. Isnt this something?
Betty, you remember Trudy.
Harry Crane. My wife, Jennifer.
Ken Cosgrove. Weve met.
- Nice to see you all again.- When are you due?
Any minute. Cant you tell?
That last month was the worst,
- but of course this is your second.- Third.
- How old is yours?- Eight months. b*at Grace.
Should we take a tour?
- I grew up in a club just like this.- Me, too.
That portly fellow in the glen plaid,second at DuPont.
The one next to him, Pan Am.
Dont hand out your card.
- Now youre getting ridiculous.- Maybe it fell out of your pocket.
- It didnt.- Well, I didnt take it.
- I didnt say you did.- Not yet.
Will you stop it, Viola?
My names not Viola. Its Carla.
Do you know Viola?
We dont all know each other, Mr. Hofstadt.
Done looking already?
Really?
- Are they still here?- Yes, theyre in Mr. Kinseys office.
I know what theyre doing.You dont want to go in there.
- What are they doing?- All Im saying is,
they obviously dont want to work,so you should just go home.
I love the commercials where the dog runsright up to the bowl of food.
How do you make him do that?
- You starve him?- So you two got a lot of girls?
Shit.
Is that that old lady again?
- Let me in.- Go away.
It stinks out here.
Come in quick.
What are you doing?
I know what youre doing. Who are you?
Jeffrey Graves, Princeton, 55.
Look, I need it for inspiration.
Its Saturday, for Gods sake.
You can go home. Well do the work.
Are you kidding?Well end up with nothing.
Ive got some ideas we can kick around,
but youre gonna have to tell me your name,sweetheart.
Im Peggy Olson,and I want to smoke some marijuana.
You wont like it.
How do you know what Ill like?
You never ask me how I feel about anything
except brassieres and body odorand makeup.
Id like to know how you feelabout a lot of things.
- Jesus. Give it a rest.- Come on.
Just like a strong cigarette.
Can you believe this?
The sun shines bright
On the old Kentucky home
Tis summer
And the darkies are gay
The corn tops ripe
And the meadows in the bloom
While the birds make music all the day
The young folks roll on the little cabin floor
All merry, all happy...
Can we go?
What about the horse race?What about supper?
Dont disappear. I want to dance.
And my old Kentucky home
Good night
I did this at home for herwith a little shoe polish.
She thought it was a scream.
I love it.
Weep no more
my lady
Oh, weep no more today
Can I get an old-fashioned?
Were on the same mission.
This bar looks like it was set upby a blind man,
and theres no bourbon.
Theres a hole at the end here.
I dont have a lot of time.
- Rye okay with you?- You look like you know what youre doing.
Im Connie, by the way.
Don.
Service always this good around here?
- Youre not a member either?- No, no.
Nice piece of property, though.
Who are you hiding from?
I am at work disguised as a party.
Im at work disguised as a wedding.
I hate other peoples weddings.
- Whys that?- Make me nervous,
all those expectations.
And these poor kids in here,
that is a match made in the boardroom.
When I was a boy,
there was a mansion on the riverI used to paddle by in my johnboat.
Twinkling lights, violins,girls giggling about something.
Its different inside.
- Where you from?- San Antonio, New Mexico,
before it was a state. Dont ask me that. Old.
You look fit.
You ever see
A Midsummer Dream with Mickey Rooney?
A Midsummer Nights Dream?
By golly, youre prickly.
Im Republican, like everyone else in there,
but somehow,no matter how expensive my cufflinks,
I feel like Ive got the head of a jackass.
Where I grew up, there was a roadhouse.
It boasted live music.That meant a drum, a bass
and a player piano with nobody at it.
I parked cars.
Fancy people would go there.
Theyd get loud, theyd get drunk,but they wouldnt let me use the toilet.
So when nature called,Id open up a trunk and relieve myself.
- You didnt.- I was 15.
Theres probably some kid out theredoing it to us right now.
Where you come from?
Pennsylvania by way of Illinois.
We lost our farm, ended up in coal country.
And here you are.
A pleasure to meet you, Don.
Hell of a cocktail.
Rum. Have some.
Some rum?
If you were feeling it, youd be hungry.
I am hungry, but its not worth moving.
She is a riot. Makes me wish I had a job.
Bacardi Eisenhower.
What are you laughing about?
You do have a job, Jeffrey.Youre a drug pusher.
What is that, an English accent?
Its a little different than freshman year.
Kinsey was a real Jersey.
I guess thats why they have scholarships.
Get out.
Youre arrogant. And you know what else?You cant sing.
Take it back.
Dearly beloved,we are gathered here not to fight.
Take it back, Graves.
Fine. I guess they kicked you outof the Tigertones because you were too tall.
Graves...
Were done here.
And by the way,I left the Tones because I had mono.
Fine. Why dont you sing a littleand let them be the judge?
I am so high.
I wish you were waiting for me.
So who are you waiting for?
A friend.
What is that like?
I dont know.
I dont think about it.
Right now, its uncomfortable, mostly.
But it moves around in there.
It does.
Im going to blame this on martinis, but...May I?
Shes not moving now.
Who are you waiting for?
My date.
You cant show up to these things stag,
but then you run into people.
I apologize. There was a line for the mirrorand I feel like Im melting.
No trouble at all.
I hope they start playing some real music.Im in the mood to dance, arent you?
Martinis.


Please, dont stand on ceremony. Dig in.
Ill cut the cheese.
What are you laughing about?
Everything is some private joke with them.
What were you gigglingabout the other day?
- A code pink.- Whats that?
They put a call over the PA
whenever theres anattractive unconscious female.
Ive never heard of that.
- Me either.- Sounds like where I work.
- Im gonna check the roast.- You need a hand?
- I dont think so.- Nonsense.
- Allow me.- Thank you.
Thanks.
You really have a lovely place.
Im glad you like it. I did most of it myself.
You must do well.
Its not easy. Not that Im complaining.
You think they make no money now?
You shouldve seen back whenRonald and I were first married.
I taught kindergartenand made three times what Ron did.
We lived in a pit.
But one dayyoull look back on this time and smile.
Just dont get pregnant.
Excuse me?
The last thing you want right now is a child.
I told her the same thing,but she doesnt listen. Shes a nurse.
You do what you want.
If Greg becomes chief resident,then things will get easier.
The fact that Greg canget a woman like you
makes me feel good about his future,no matter what happens.
Bobby, Sally, suppertime!
You have to eat something.
You dont tell me what to do.
You either eat or you dont eat,but therell be no more of that.
I told you Im not hungry.
- I want my money.- You dont even know that you lost it.
Maybe you should lie down. Sally!
Grandpa, is this it?
Grandpa, is this your money?
I dont know. Let me see it.
Yeah, thats it, all right.
Well, thats a relief.Sally, your foods getting cold.
Excuse me.
Why, thank you.
Hes pretending likewe didnt have a fight on the way over.
He seems amenable right now.
I warned him that with this set
there was a good chanceone of my old beaus might appear.
- And yet they didnt.- Which is a relief.
I dont want to. All I have to talk aboutis work, which is verboten.
Well, thats nonsense.Youre very charming.
Come on. Ill talk.
They want to knowwere having a good time.
Well, were really having a good time.
Havent seen you two on the dance floor.
I dont move that well right now.
Don loves to dance,
but I think Im disappointing himbecause I dont feel like it.
Your asses are going towear out those chairs.
Roger.
Don, Betty, this is Henry Francis and...
Sherry Ardmore.
Henry works in the governors office.
Don Draper. This is my wife, Betty.
Hank, tell them whereyou were this afternoon.
- Roger...- Theyre gonna read about it in the paper.
He just came from Pocantico.Rockefeller married Happy.
She just got divorced a month ago.She has four children.
You see? Thats the first reaction.
Divorce is political hari-kari.
Now well be stuck with Goldwater.
The primaries are still a long way off.
- Why did Rocky marry her?- Theyre in love.
Were going to dance.
Betty, Don,are you sure youre not up for it?
I have got to bring a date next time.
"This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world ends
"This is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper"
We got it. Youre educatedand you sang in the Tiger...
- What are they called?- Tigertones.
I went to the University of Michigan.
I went to Miss Deavers Secretarial School.
Can you believe her?
I keep thinking about rum,and I keep thinking about Cuba,
and I keep thinking abouthow were all going to die.
- We almost died.- But we didnt.
How about something about life?
Lets go on the roof.
And do what?
Think about Daiquiri Beach.We need five more situations for rum.
On the roof is a good idea, actually.A hammock right between the clotheslines.
And you still say Daiquiri Beach.
Are you working?
I think so.
You both can leave.
Im in a very good place right now.
You left your purse in your office,unattended.
- Someone could have stolen it.- No ones here.
You think I dont knowwhat youve been doing in there?
- I dont know what to say.- Ive got nothing to hide.
Well, youre free to do whatever you want,but youre not thinking about your future.
The thing is,
I have a job.
I have my own officewith my name on the door,
and I have a secretary. Thats you.
And I am not scared of any of this.
But youre scared.
Oh, my God. Youre scared.
Dont worry about me.
I am going to get to do everythingyou want for me.
Im going to be fine, Olive.
I really am.
Your expense report is readyfor your review. Its on your desk.
I need you to get the Dictaphone set up,
and I need a glass of water,and then you can go.
Thats very pretty.
Thank you.
- When are you due?- Early September.
You and the First Lady.
Well, I think she looks a lot better.
You could dress like that.
Go to Lord & Taylorand ask for my friend Bunny Appelle.
- Shell take care of you.- You really know everything, Joan.
Honey, would you talk to your husband?
I dont know what Im going to do next year.
He is going to be a tough act to follow.
Those people in Texaswill be crawling all over you.
If I ever need a pneumonectomy,thats the man.
You heard me say it. Great hands.
Look, Greg, its a complicated operation.
Christ, thats not what I meant.
- It happens.- What happened?
I dont like to worry Joanieabout those kinds of things.
Come on. Everyone getsa bad result every once in a while.
You know what? Enough shop talk.This is not civilian conversation.
Do you want to play charades?
- Come on. Youre terrible.- No, Im not.
Well, Joanie has many, many talents.You should play for them.
- No.- Come on. Ill go get it.
- Youre all gonna love this.- What do you play?
I am out of practice.
- Come on, Joanie.- Wonderful!
Come on, just sing a little something.
Itll be just like the olden days.
We used to sit in the parlor after supper.
My mother would play the pianowhile we read.
Just let me have another biteand then we can go.
I guess were the last ones to eat.Thats what my mother always said.
Family holds back.
You shouldnt be filling your plate.Youre the hostess.
- Ill get you some food.- Come on. Come on.
- You should sit down.- Okay.
Oh, my God! Youre pregnant.
- Youre so beautiful.- Thank you.
Dont you just love looking at her?
Arent they a beautiful couple?
I knew you two would get back together.
I never had any doubt,no matter what the problem was.
Ill take care of her.
You dont like me.
Im a nice person.
Whats going on here?
I shouldve eaten something.
Will someone please get hera glass of milk?
Don, can I talk to you for a second?
What the hell was that?
Your wifes drunk.
I dont know what I didto get under your skin.
Roger, its late.
You know, my mother was right.
Its a mistake to be conspicuously happy.Some people dont like it.
No one thinks youre happy.They think youre foolish.
You know, thats the great thingabout a place like this,
you can come here and be happy,and you get to choose your guests.
Good night, Grandpa.
Get in here.
Sit down.
Where were we?
