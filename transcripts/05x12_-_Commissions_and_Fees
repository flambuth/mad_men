Previously on Mad Men.
Tell them I want a partnership.
Not silent.
How am I supposed tofind $     in two days?
Theyll bury your desk in awards,but theyll never work with you.
Not after that letter.
Bye.
Ill see you in two weeks.
Jaguar is calling thepresident every agency
well that is terrific news.
Bravo!
( Theme music playing )
( opera playing )
Buongiorno, gino.
Mr. Covington, youre early.
Im not in a rush, believe me.
Don?
Jed, Jed Covington from Dancer.
Jed, nice to see you.
Please have a seat.Im almost finished here.
Believe me, hesimpossible to bother.
This is a man who won Jaguar.
What is that?
Its like an expensive,unreliable Dodge.
What, they didnt go for that?
We tried writing sexylike you did,
but frankly our creativewent home early.
Well, well see whats left of what wedid after working with them for a month.
And Peter...
Campbell, is that his name?
Boy, were theyimpressed with him.
This is a big winfor your little agency.
You really eat English muffins?
Yes, but theyre not English.
Well, to those of us at   As,everything about you is American...
your sense of humor,your hard work.
A lot of people joinprofessional associations
and just use itas an excuse to drink
and hand out business cards.
Well, there has beena bit of that.
Im sure there areothers more deserving.
Who?    months afterlosing Lucky Strike
to landing a car...you kept that place afloat.
I suppose the worldcould see it that way.
Well, the   As could usea little of that.
And theres a little tripto the greenbrier
for the conferencewith wives... or without.
Well, I suppose I accept.
But dont expect any miracles.
Great.And dont be so modest.
Joan:Thank you, gentlemen.
This shouldnt belonger than an hour.
Scarlett, you have to makesure the freelance squatters
are relocated beforethe partners meeting.
- Also?- Also there should be Danish.
- All partners present?- Partners: Aye.
Shall we beginwith old business?
- Ongoing.- Ongoing.
If I may begin.
Weve received a confusingrequest from Jaguar.
They want to explore theidea of going with a fee structure.
as opposed tostraight commission.
- Is there a difference?- Well, its a very interesting issue.
In its most simplistic form,
the money we receivefor work on an account
is derived from the   % commissionincluded in our media purchases,
plus the markupon production costs.
But under a fee structure,
the client merely paysfor the work being done,
plus a negotiated  / - % profit.
Well, that is interesting.
The client asked for it.Thats not good.
What if Dunlop tireswants to do that?
Thats a good hypothetical.
If they can get it,wont everyone want it?
Whatever it is?
Its not hypothetical. Dunlop called last night.Theyd like to meet.
Well, why didntyou say something?
I was going to waitfor new business.
- Is it new business yet?- I dont know.
- What are the billings?- A little under a million
including sporting goodsand tubing.
But every Jaguar wears them,
so you know theyve heardgood things about us.
Incoming calls... what a welcoming sound.Thank you Mr. Campbell.
Shouldnt we have a vote
on the fee versuscommission, um, question?
I already said no.
Or should I leave so you allcan do whatever you want?
I move we tell themwell look into it,
and then well look into it.
I second that.
All in favor?
So more new business?Back to ongoing business?
- Do we have any birthdays?- ( Laughs )
Is there a TV there?
Its nights wild west.
You guys will miss school andyoure getting to go skiing.
I think the wild westis very low on that list.
Now put your bowl in the sinkand go get dressed.
Henry will be home in an hour.I wanna b*at the traffic.
Try these.Theyre the biggest.
I dont wanna wearsomeone elses shoes,
especially ski boots.
You know that theyre sweaty.
( Sniffs ) Oh, my gosh!
- Try them on.- Eleanor has smaller feet than me now.
And Im not goingskiing anyway.
You think youre going to get sent inthe lodge and read a book, forget it.
I would have rather gone to school andcome home and found you all gone.
Is this your plan...to ruin our ski trip?
Im old enough that I can stay alonewhile you go laugh your heads off.
Fine! Ill leave youlocked in a trunk.
Just let me go to daddys.
Do they ever take youon vacation?
Megan and daddy took meto Disneyland where its warm.
You want to spendthe weekend there with her
because she lets you dowhatever you want?
She lets me eatwhatever I want.
- ( Buzzes )- Mrs. Francis on line  .
Hello?
I wanted to know if youwould have any problem
with me strangling Sally.
Should we be having thisconversation on the phone?
Im not joking.Shes fresh.
And Id prefer not to haveher sour puss ruining our trip!
( Thumps )
Well, if you think k*ll heris the only way out of that.
- Were dropping her off.- ( Intercom buzzes )
- Mr. Cooper here to see you.- Send him in.
Im gonna be busy all weekend.
Its your child brideshe wants to spend time with.
Are you still askingfor a favor?
Im not asking.
Were dropping her offin an hour
and she can sleep with thedoorman for all I care.
I have a question I dont know how tophrase other than as an accusation.
- What?- I took it upon myself to evaluate the fee issue.
And upon examinationof our books,
I found this canceled checkin an unopened statement.
Id ask youif you knew about it,
but your signatureson the check.
- So it is.- I thought we agreed to forego bonuses.
- We did.- And yet you gave him one.
Bert, Ill take care of it.
You know, you cant keepbeing the good little boy
while the adultsrun this business.
Dawn, could you getMr. Pryce in here?
( Sighs )
( Knocks )
- You wanted to see me?- Close the door.
Did you hear about the   As?
I hope its all right.I accepted on behalf of the firm.
What the hell is this?
Oh, this.
Uh, I remember.
I didnt sign it.
Of course you did.Right there.
You want me to play detective?
- Don, we all sign a lot of things.- Is this the only one?
I wont sit here and bearthis interrogation.
You want a professionalto do it?
- ( Liquid pouring )- Im giving you a chance to come clean.
Is this the only one?
How did you get this?
Cooper opened the latest bankstatement and the books.
It was a   -day loan.
But then we canceledthe bonuses.
You delayed them,and then you canceled them.
Then you wantedthe money for Joan.
And Im the onewhos committed the crime?
- Are you gambling?- No.
I owe taxes on my portfolio.
Which I liquidated
to put $  ,    into this firmafter we lost Lucky Strike.
If you needed it so badly,why didnt you ask?
Why suffer the humiliationfor a   -day loan?
That was my money!
Im gonna needyour resignation.
( Stammering ) Just a moment.
Im sorry and I am remorseful.
I dont knowhow it came to this,
but the companysin ship shape.
And I will make good by easter,
even if I have to pullmy son out of school.
You embezzled fundsand you forged my signature.
I apologize deeplyfor involving you.
I suppose I picked you because youvealways been the most decent to me.
Im doing the most decent thingI could possibly do, Lane.
Im letting you resign.
I have never been compensated
for my contributionsto this company,
including my rolein its very existence.
Who would ever have dreamtof the word Jaguar, hmm?
I took away nothing from P.P.L.While you lined your pockets.
And I have operatedon a loss for three years!
Please reconsider.
Im sorry.
I cant trust you.
Ill cover the moneythat you owe.
( Laughs )
That  ,    is nothing to you.
Do you knowhow the rest of us live?
And in the end, whosbeen harmed, really, hmm?
Can you imagine what wouldhappen if a client found out?
Ill lose my visa.
I cant go back toEngland, not like this.
What would I tell my wife?
( Weeping )What would I tell my son?
Youll tell them that it didntwork out because it didnt.
And youll tell themthe next thing will be better,
because it always is.
Take the weekend.
Think about an elegant exit.
Cooper doesnt know anything.
I feel a bitlight-headed.
Thats relief.
Ive started over a lot, Lane.
This is the worst part.
( Sighs )
Were you celebrating with Don?
Celebrating?
Scarlett told me aboutyour   As chairmanship.
Congratulations.
You look busy.
Im thinking about takinga vacation this easter.
Oh.
Where are we going?
Do you think there is a differencebetween Bermuda and Hawaii?
Well, neither is suitable for commemoratingthe death and resurrection of our Lord.
Can you imagine melocked in a hotel room
with a baby and my mother?
I suppose youd ratherI imagined you
bouncing in the sandin some obscene bikini.
I think you should takeyour party elsewhere.
Well...Bon voyage.
I had to get up very earlythis morning. To go to work.
To make more money,buy you more champagne.
( Laughs )
Go back to bed.
Shes a   -year-old coatcheck girl from Long Island
or Rhode Island.
Shed never had room service before.Its too easy.
Why do we do this?
For the sex,
but its always disappointing.
For me, anyway.
I dont like what were doing.
So youre drinkingwith a purpose.
Im tired of this piddly shit.
Im tired of living in thisdelusion that were going somewhere
when we cant even giveChristmas bonuses.
What about your speech about howwe were arriving and so forth?
Or how we arrived.I dont remember but it was good.
So you feel differentsince Jaguar?
- Were getting incoming calls.- Pete is.
Look, I dont like him, but heskind of turned things around.
He still thinks small.
Dunlops another Topaz.Its another Mohawk.
Its another coat check girl.
- So you dont want it?- No.
I dont want Jaguar;I want Chevy.
I dont want Mohawk;I want American.
I dont want Dunlop;I want Firestone.
Dont yell at me.Id love to have Firestone.
I spent the nightat the American Cancer Society
with my handin Jim Bartons pocket
and you told me I was wasting my time.You told me he was dead.
Because Ed Baxter told methe Lucky Strike letter
poisoned us with allthose companies.
What? Why didntyou tell me that?
Because I wrote that letter.
You let that wax figurinediscourage you?
Why didnt you just ask me?Ill get you a meeting with Firestone.
- It doesnt mean its not true.- Jesus, Don.
You used to love no.No used to make you hard.
And whether you admit it ornot, things have changed.
You just b*at outtwo huge firms
for that shitty car account.
Caroline, get me JamesBarton at Firestone tires.
- No, get Ed Baxter.- Let that go.
Whats down chemical bill?   million?
Its about the same sizeas Lucky Strike.
Im telling you, Ed Baxter is Moby Dick.There are easier whales.
So you cant get me a meeting.Theyre three buildings away.
Look, Im surehell meet with you,
even if its just to watch youeat shit, but its complicated.
What about Kenny?
In case youve forgotten, he squeamishabout working with his family.
Then fire him.
( Door opens, closes )
( Doorbell rings )
- Hi!- What are you doing here?
My dad didnt eventell you, did he?
Im spending the weekendhere because I didnt want to go skiing.
I thought youd be excited.
I just didnt know.Whats wrong with skiing?
I hate her so much.Shes such a phony.
You know thats not true.
Can we have tea?
Go ahead and put the water out.
( Piano music playing )
Sorry Im late.
I dont mind waiting   minutes for an unspecified
meeting with my boss.
I mean, its not like your imaginationwould run wild.
( Laughs )
So were going afteryour father-in-law.
I see.
Well, Ive told you before,I cant help with that.
- Thats what Im counting on.- What the hell does that mean?
We want the business and ithas nothing to do with you.
And wed like to keep itthat way, since youd prefer
not to jeopardize yourrelationship with your wife.
So what do youthinks gonna happen
when Ed calls methe minute you call him?
I dont know.
I suppose you couldnot answer the phone.
You might be havinga drink with your boss.
Thats very smart.
I guess theres nothingI can do to muck it up now.
What the hell does that mean?
Well, Id hate to bringit up with Cynthia,
even by accident.
Look at you.
What would it take for you to do nothing?
Some kind of partnership,assuming it works out?
No, I dont want tobe your partner.
Not seeing whats involved.
All I need is a promisethat if you get it,
youll force me on it.
Okay.
You really fought us.
And two other things.
Pete doesnt go to the meeting
and Pete doesnt goto any meetings.
As you were.
- Where are you coming from?- Hemisphere club.
Ive got good news.I talked to Ed.
- What did he say?- That hell see you Monday morning.
Monday?Are you kidding me?
You said to get you a meeting,I got you a meeting.
You think this isa serious meeting,
giving me    hours to prepare?
I think thats up to you.
Dont lose your nerve.
I like that guy I saw today.
I missed him.
( TV playing )
Oh. Whend you get here?
After lunch.They couldnt wait to get rid of me.
- Wheres Megan?- Taking a nap.
- I love when you surprise me.- I forgot about it.
Well, dont forget Bettys notcoming home until Monday afternoon,
so you can drive herout to school Monday morning.
I have a meeting.Youll have to do it.
I have an audition.Im gonna be gone all morning.
( Sighs )
Sally, youre gonna be herealone Monday morning.
Megans got plans until lunch.
- I have school.- Not any more.
Turn off the damn TV.
Anything else?
You dont even call me?
Do you knowhow insulting it is,
the assumption that I havenothing else to do?
I had to fire Lane today.
What?
What happened?
He stole moneyfrom the company.
He seems so honest.
Why would he do that?
Whats the difference?
Its all just gossipat a certain point.
You cant tell anyone.
Is the firm okay?
Well be fine.
Did you eat or just drink?
Im not hungry.
Well, youre gonna havedinner with your daughter.
- I have a lot of work to do.- So do I.
After dinner.
- What are you doing there?- Were going to dinner.
- No, dear.- Were going to celebrate.
- More, obviously.- No, damn it.
Whats gotten into you?
Ive had a dreadful day, dear.
Not all of it.
Im tired of you refusing to recognizethe successes when they come.
I know your workis unpleasant sometimes,
but Im very proud of you.
Youre very kind.
You obviously had a good daythat turned into a bad day
and you drank too much.
But you came hometo me on time.
Now youre taking me to dinner.
No arguments.
Cant we just take a cab?
I thought racing green.
- How did you get this?- I wrote a check.
I hope youre not cross.
You know what?I dont care if you are.
You never spend on yourself.
Its always about my travelor Nigels schooling.
And I told the salesmanyou were a partner
at the cars advertising agency
and he gave mea very fair price.
Come, lets takea little drive.
Its lovely.
Go on, sit in it.
( Vomiting )
Oh, dear.You really did overdo it.
( Vomiting )
Okay, found it.
You sure you dont wanna come?
He wants to work.Look at him.
Hes got a big meetingtomorrow.
Hell be miserable.
You girls have fun.
Rebecca:Its cleared up.
You could just goround the block
if youre still notfeeling steady.
Ive work to do.
I dont understand you.
Are you really going to spendyour whole weekend working?
Dont you like your present?
I love the carand I love you so much,
but I dont feelright driving it
until Ive taken care of someof these errands Ive let go.
Therell beplenty of time, dear.
You got sick from drinkagain yesterday.
Why do you continue?
Its cognac.It settles the stomach.
Well, finish up and thenwell go for a drive.
I dont think theresreally anything to see.
I was telling Sally aboutmy plan to ensnare David.
Either way, Carters gonnawanna rehearse with you alone.
- Can I get some coffee?- Ill have some, too.
Hes not gonnabring you coffee.
Um... "Georgy girl,".
"Alfie," "Gambit,."
"Night of the generals,""Blow-up"?
Anything without ab*rtionor foreigners in it?
Lets see."Fistful of dollars."
I think your father would k*llme if I see that without him.
So, I dont understand.Do you like David or Carter?
Well, Carter likes me.
Do you know what he said to me?
I cant believeI didnt tell you this.
He asked if I wasa redhead everywhere.
Stop! Okay?
No, its okay.I have a boyfriend.
- Since when?- A while.
But I dont knowif he likes me that way.
Then hes not a boyfriend.
A lot of great romancesstart out as friendships.
A boyfriends a person
that makes you feel special,
a person that knows you.
And holding hands is plenty.
You should seeif you can get a drink.
I dont want a drink.
( Distant traffic blaring )
( Engine chugging )
( Engine chugging )
( Engine chugging, grinding )
( Sighs )
- Are you using the lodge phone?- Sally: No.
I told Betty and Henry to taketheir ski vacation and shove it.
- Are you stuck with Bluto again?- No, Im at Megans.
Thats better, I bet.
Actually, Im gonna beall alone tomorrow morning.
Wanna come visit me?
- Really?- You can take the train.
Its not that easy.
Ive gotta sneak off campus,which is serious.
Plus, its a   -minutebike ride to the station
and then two hourson the train.
Forget it.
For a year youve been saying howmuch you wanted to visit me.
Are we ever gonnasee each other?
All right.
The earliest I can getto grand central is  :  ,
but Im gonna have to workon my paper tonight
to get it typed tomorrow.
    park, apartment   b.
I gotta get a pen.
( Typewriter clacking )
Do your homework, dont use thejuicer, and Ill be home around  :  .
And the first thing Imgonna do is feel that TV.
- Break a leg.- Thanks.


You gonna tell mewhat youre gonna talk about
or is my look of surprisepart of the sales pitch?
I dont want itto sound rehearsed.
No danger of that.
Just go in thereand keep your cool.
But if he baits you, I want youto punch him in the balls.
What happenedto your enlightenment?
I dont know.
It wore off.
- ( Doorbell rings )- Sally: Just a minute!
- Hey.- Come in.
You didnt check the peephole.
I knew it was you, silly.The doorman sent you up.
- You dont look that different.- Well, you do.
What do you think?
Theres a kid at school whoseparents have one better than this.
It has a second floor.
- Mm, what do you wanna do?- Are you kidding?
The museumsright across the park.
We dont go across the park.Theres bums on the other side.
Ive got money for a cab.
Okay. Let me get my jacket.
Howd they getall these animals?
Teddy Roosevelt k*ll them.
Do you thinkthey were a family?
I hope so. Otherwise,what were they doing?
Walking around saying, "we just needa baby to finish this diorama"?
( Both laugh )
Theres this kid,Anderson, hes a senior.
He keeps picking fights withme and hes twice my size.
What a jerk.
All the senior lacrosse guyspeed in my locker.
They ruined my jersey.Theyre a bunch of sadists.
Henry got picked onwhen he was little,
and now he runs a city.
Thats true.
I keep wishinghe would leave her.
I know its wrong.I feel really bad.
Dont. You cant makeit happen.
Just so you know,I could get in trouble, too,
but I really wanted to see you.
Yeah, I cant believeI almost didnt come.
My stomach hurts.
Maybe youre hungry.Want some caribou?
( Laughs )
Listen, I feel kind of bad.
They were teasing meand I might have told them
that I was coming to the cityto, um... to do it with you.
- Really?- Yeah.
They dont knowhow old you are.
I hope thats okay.
You can say whateveryou want, but I...
Im not sure thatsthe way I like you.
Yeah, good.
Yeah. I always thinkthat youre, like,
my little sister, except smart.
You have a mustache.
I usually shave on sunday night.
- I didnt think youd care.- I dont like it.
I really dont feel well.Ill be right back.
Okay.Meet me in Africa.
( Toilet flushes )
Woman: Mr. Baxter will see you now.You can leave your coats.
An hour and    minutes.
Better than I thought.
( Chuckles )
This is Tom Schafer,director of marketing.
Jack Schmidt,head of household.
- Roger Sterling.- Don Draper.
( Clears throat )
Ed, you said theyre gonnabring your son-in-law.
Ken knows better.
So, Don, whats so urgent?
I didnt say urgent.I said imminent.
Well, Ed, I wanna talkabout your business.
What about it?
See, Ive been lookingat what youre doing
and I think yourein desperate need of change.
- And youre just the guy to do it.- I am.
Are you still the guywho wrote that letter?
I dont wanna hearabout that letter again.
Do you know how hard wefought to save that account?
And they stabbed usfirst, believe me.
And nobodys gonna wanna bein the cigarette business.
The governments in theprocess of k*ll it.
- So youre vindictive.- Not as vindictive as you, apparently.
( Chuckles ) I had a feelingthis is what this was all about.
Its not. This isabout your business.
Well, we appreciate that, butwere very happy with Macmanus.
Im sure theyrevery happy with you,
but you dontowe them anything.
All they have to do is keeprunning the same work.
Youre on the back burnerover there,
subsidizing all the greatcreative work theyre doing
and paying fornew business lunches.
As soon as you walk away, thatplace will fold up like a tent.
Were at   % market sharein almost everything we make.
Because you have a big line ofdiverse and charismatic products
and you keep making more...Ziptape, Styrofoam, Rovana.
And why do you do that?
Because even though success is areality, its effects are temporary.
You get hungry, even thoughyouve just eaten.
At the old firm, we hadLondon fog raincoats.
We had a year where we sold  % of the raincoats
- in the United States.- Name another raincoat.
But we didnt stopworking for them
because   % isnt enough.
Tell me about napalm.
You mean that stuff those kidsoutside your building are screaming about?
Napalm was invented in     .
The government put it inflamethrowers against the n*zi,
impact b*mb againstthe Japanese.
It was all over Korea.I was there.
And now its in Vietnam.
But the important thing is when ourboys are fighting and they need it,
America needs it,Dow makes it and it works.
( Ed clears throat )
But it doesnt change the fact
that were happywith our agency.
Are you?Youre happy with   %?
Youre on topand you dont have enough.
Youre happy becauseyoure successful for now.
But what is happiness?
Its a moment beforeyou need more happiness.
I wont settle for   % of anything.I want    %.
Youre happy with your agency?Youre not happy with anything.
You dont want most of it.You want all of it.
And I wont stopuntil you get all of it.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you for stopping by.
Ill buy you a drink if youwipe the bl*od off your mouth.
Sally?
Sally?
Henry: Sally!
- Whats going on?- She just pulled up in a cab with a $   fare.
I got it.
Sally? Let me in.
Is Henry out there?
No. Let me in.
I got my...my period started
and I didnt know what to do.
I just wanted to come home.
Its okay.Well take care of it.
Its okay, sweetheart.
Its okay.
- Im sorry to bother you, but can I leave these here?- Why?
Mr. Pryce hasnt come in yetand his door is locked,
and I dont feel comfortablewith the companys records
parked on the edge of my desk.
Just leave them.
Please tell him to call methe minute he gets back.
Thank you, Dawn.
- Can I help you?- Is Sally here?
Shes not.Who are you?
Im Glen.I... I left my bag here.
- Do you know where she is?- No. I just asked you.
- What is going on what are you doing here?- I dont know, okay?
We went to the museumand she said she wasnt
feeling well, and thenshe just took off.
I looked for her and finally justthought maybe she came back here.
I just need my bag, okay?
Calm down.
- When was this?- I dont know.
I was at the museumfor a long time.
I... I really lookedfor her.
I didnt do anything.I just want my bag.
I would have left it,but Ive got a book
on Nat Turner in thereand my papers due tomorrow.
- ( Phone ringing )- Dont move.
- Hello?- Yes, Megan.
I was just calling to sayif you or Don were wondering
where Sally is,she found her way home.
( Sighs ) Thank God.
I just found outor I would have called.
What happened?
Well...
She became a woman today.
She started.
Oh.
I think she justneeded her mother.
No, of course.
Well, let her knowthat Im glad shes okay.
I will.
What happened?
She wasnt feeling well.
- Was that Betty?- Yes.
Where are you going?
To grand central to getthe train back to school.
Ive already lostone kid today.
Ill put you on the train.
Well, it doesntleave until  :  .
( Sighs )
Look, just wait here,finish your paper.
Ill take you later.
Do you want something to eat?
If you dont mind.
Oh.
( Laughter )
Whats going on?
I think somethingsterribly wrong
in Mr. Pryces office.
I cant get the door open.
Dear Lord.
( Crying )
Jesus.
Here.
Are you feeling better?
- Im so embarrassed.- Dont be.
And if you ever get in trouble likethat again, just ask another woman.
- Theyll understand.- Oh, gosh, I dont wanna talk about it.
Move over.I wanna lie down.
Theres a lotof responsibilities,
but thats what beinga woman is.
And when it happens every month,
even though its unpleasant,
it means everythings working.
It means everythingsready for a baby
when you want one.
And maybe youll havea beautiful girl
and you can tell her all this.
( Laughing )
Well, Ill tell youone thing...
if they haventcalled the agency,
they probably calledthe men in white coats.
Pete: Hello?
I think you should sit down.
Whats going on?
Lane hanged himselfin his office.
What?
( Crying )
Cooper sent everybody home.
Told them there wasa building emergency.
Nobody knows.
What the hell happened?
Who knows?
Come on, Im taking you home.
- No, I wanna wait.- For what?
Were waiting for the coroner tocut him down and take him away.
What, hes still in there?
You cant leave him like that.
They said notto disturb the body.
- Its a crime scene.- Come on.
You cant leave him like that.
Get something to cut him down.
Here, cut.
Jesus.
Come on.
Lets go.
"To my fellow partners."
Open it.
Its a resignation letter.
Its boilerplate.
What are you doing home?
Um, hello, Mr. Draper.
Who are you?
This is Glen.Hes Sallys friend.
Hes waiting for his train.
Wheres Sally?
She went home. Ill explain later.
I dont understand.I gotta lie down.
Weve met before.
I used to live down thestreet in Ossining.
You know my mother,Helen Bishop?
Oh, right.
I should just go.
And sit in Grand Centraluntil  :  ?
- Ill be fine.- Where are you headed?
I go to Hotchkiss.
Its up in Lakeville.Its a couple of hours away.
Thats fine.Lets go.
- Are you sure?- Yes.
Are you okay?
I had a bad day.We can talk about it later.
Thank you very muchfor your hospitality, Megan.
It was very nice to meet you.
( Sighs )
Why does everythingturn out crappy?
What do you mean?
I dont know.
Everything you wanna do,
everything you thinksgonna make you happy
just turns to crap.
Youre too youngto talk that way.
But its true.
What do you wanna do?
If you could do anything.
What would you do?
