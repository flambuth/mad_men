- Hello?- I apologize for the hour.
You instructed me to avoid your offices.
But we have good news.
Thank goodness.
The Hansard procedure negotiationshave concluded as promised.
You need only wirethe full ?2,900 by Thursday
and your slate will be clearwith the Inland Revenue.
As promised?
Your promise was to extricate mefrom this situation altogether.
My promise was to keep you out of prison.
Thursday.
How am I supposed to find$8,000 in two days?
Thats not possible. Thats no help at all.
Look, Lane, you gaveHer Majestys portion to a foreign power,
and the tax man is keento make an example of an expatriate.
This is the very best news there could be.
You should get a pencil.
Ill give you the information.
What are you doing out here?
Business. Get back to bed, dear.
- What are you looking for?- Go back to bed this minute!
Scarlett, hold this and stand here.
No.
Mr. Kinsey called regarding lunch.
- What does he want?- I think he wants to have lunch.
- Whats wrong with him? Hes very polite.- Yeah.
You should have seen himat Kens bachelor party.
- I think he was on LSD.- Really?
Hes sort of been threatening to "spot" by.
Scarlett, here you are.
Im sorry, Mr. Pryce. Do you need me?
Only in that I wanted youto direct me to Mr. Crane.
Please leave us.
Ill meet him for coffee.
I was hoping we could discussthe first quarter media projections.
Sure.
These numbers are very positive.
Theyre projections.
Theyre derived from reality,but theyre hopes and dreams.
January and February look great.
Heinz, Mohawk, Vicks, all pretty stable.
When will they become commitments?
I cant predict the future, Lane.
I dont knowwhat the Russians are going to do.
We may be living undergroundby Lincolns birthday.
Thats my only copy.
Hope you dont need any actual paperworkbecause everythings out by my desk
and my desk is out by Chuck.
Hows Rebecca?
About the same, underfed and underpaid.
And Laura?
She calls me during the dayand shes peachy.
But I come home and shes blue.
- To the holidays.- To gin.
So, Walt, what do you thinkabout extending our credit by $50,000?
I didnt know we weregoing to talk real business.
Should I slow down?
How do things look for 67?
The projections suggest...
No projections.Were only interested in commitments.
Yes, the commitments are firm,
but no ones been payingtheir bills on time.
I got it. Done.
Are you going away?
No. I love Christmas in Manhattan.
Can you take care of it today?Id like to start writing checks immediately.
Sure.
Were heading to Florida.
I want to fly,but I think were going to drive.
- Roger, Coopers office.- Coming.
Whats the hurry, Harry?
Are you drunk?
Pearl Harbor Day. Show some respect.
How are you doing with your b*mb?
Remember Lanes fool at Jaguar,Edwin Baker?
You mean Bazooka Joe?
Three weeks ago,he was replaced by Hugh Hibbert,
and we are back in the running.
- He called you?- No, I called him.
In fact, Ive been workinga few prospects over there for months,
waiting for Edwin to self-destruct,
and he did...
Spectacularly, apparently.
He vomited in the lapof the head of the dealers association.
Who else?
It sounds like Foote Cone,Ted Bates, DArcy.
Everyone who doesnt have a car.
- What is that, nine of us?- No, its five.
And size-wise, were the smallest,
so lets all start boning upon the wonders of Jaguar.
We have a meet-and-greet next week
and the presentationsare sometime in mid-January.
Thats a lot of work.
Yes. You may have to stay past 5:30.
Id live here if I thoughtit was more than a pipe dream.
We reject the material world
in favor of the recognitionof ones true identity.
I dont understand what youre saying.
Paul?
Harry Crane, as I live and breathe.
What the hell happened to you?
Krishna consciousness.
Dont pretend this isnt strange.
Thats why I wanted you to see it.
Consider it seen. I really should be going.
Harry, Ive been tryingto get you down here.
Remember how anxious, how insecure,how terrified I was of living life?
Its gone.
Can you imagine living that way, Harry?
Im sorry, this is giving me the willies.
Please, keep an open mind.
Can we do this for a few minutes?
Am I allowed to be here?
- Everyones allowed to be here.- Hello, there.
Harry, this is Mother Lakshmi.
Hare Krishna, Harry.
- I get it.- Get what?
- I should go.- No.
Chant with us.
Youll like it. I promise.
Rogers not coming.Hes on Battleship Row.
But Ive already told him.
I called this meeting.
Wheres Joan?
Its best Joans not herefor my announcement.
I dont know about yours.
- Go ahead.- Very well.
A recent pass of the booksshows that we have
a surplus of $50,000,
and I believe that enables usto distribute Christmas bonuses.
Equal shares to full partners,half shares to juniors,
2% gifts to S.N.C. and 4% E.N.C.
God bless us, everyone.
And I shall see to it thatthe checks are distributed immediately.
Actually, lets waittill the Christmas party.
Someones not going to be happy,and Id rather not stare at her for a month.
Approved.
- Don...- I have to announce
that were in the running...I mean, actually this time
for Jaguar.
So its time we all get some learningon this fine automobile.
I intend to drive the Mark IIthis afternoon.
Don,
dont you think the bonuses wouldmake more of an impact now?
Theres nothing like a surprise for morale.
Not my morale.
The Jaguar announcementshould be good for morale.
And, as much as it affects me personally,
I think we should sit tight on the bonuses.
Jaguar will provide only a little seedand well have to supplement.
Damn it!
We can afford to do both.
- What ghost visited you, Ebenezer?- Pete.
You asked me to stop this last time.
Yes, other than Roger,
who started drinkingat exactly 7:55 this morning,
no one has given me the reaction I desire
from this blessed event.
Bert.
Theyre lemons. They never start.
Meeting adjourned.
You like my shirt?
Its very festive.
You know, its sacrilege to say this,
but Pearl Harbor was an act of genius.
The only thing they didnt plan forwas success.
The Japs wonand they didnt know what to do with it.
Mr. Sterling,
seeing as youre dressed for fishing,
youll have more success if youre quiet.
Dont be like that.
I couldnt care less.
I know why youre mad.
But Jane is not going to take everything.
It never occurred to me.
Because the Army istaking such good care of you?
- Have I asked?- No.
And you shouldnt have to and you dontand you keep sending it back.
Because its a short-term solution.
- I told you, Ill cover Kevin through college.- No.
Its better this way for him.
And if youre not careful,you wont even be a family friend.
- Joanie, I had an experience.- I know, Roger.
Its not about honor.
Its about the fact thatwe created a human life.
We made a baby.
Yes.
And now its some other lucky girls turn.
Scarlett.
Hello.
All of us have a very close connection.
Krishna.
My head is humming.
And your mind is clear.
Yeah.
I should be getting back.
Holy shit, how long have I been here?
- Are you hungry?- I am.
Paramatma, take him for some food.
Yes, Mother Lakshmi.Thats a beautiful idea.
- Harry, will you eat with me?- Just the two of us?
But when we are
in the material, conditional life,
we forget this.
It is so good to see you.
Its good to see you, too.
But Im not gonna join.
I dont want you to.
But I can tell you really got into that.
I can tell you really got into Lakshmi.
I love her deeply, Harry.
Absolutely. Shes my kind of religion.
Its not like that.
Lakshmi lived most of her lifeas a girl named Janet,
whose promiscuityled her to drugs and prostitution.
The movement saved her life.
So whats your excuse?
I was at rock bottom.
I had really degraded myself.
- At McCann?- No, damn it.
Listen,
I love what the movement has given me,
but I dont understandwhy I have to live like that to love God.
Are they making you stay?
Its just Lakshmi.
- So you dont wanna share, huh?- You dont understand.
I want to make a life with her,but not there.
So what does that have to do with me?
She was a runaway, and she wont leave
unless she knowsshe wont wind up back on the streets.
You want money. I knew it.
You know what? Go eat by yourself.
Stop, stop.
Money solves today, not tomorrow.
Up here on the right.
And for your information,Prabhupad is buying.
Im sorry I said
I couldnt come because of the accident.
Im sorry.
Excuse me.
"Can you help me, doctor?" I asked him.
"It started... It started," I said,
"when I was sitting in frontof the television set
"with my feet on the coffee table.
"Now, Ive sat there hundreds of times,
"thousands maybe,with a can of beer in my hand.
"I like to have a can of beer in my handwhen I watch the beer ads.
"But now, for no reason I could think of,
"the ad was making me sick.
"So I used the remote controlto get to another channel,
"but each channel made me just as sick.
"The television was one thing,
"and I was a person,and I was going to be sick.
"So I turned it off
"and had a panicky moment.
"I smelled the beer in my hand.
"And as I vomited,I looked around the living room
"for something to grab onto."
- Do you want something to eat?- Nope.
Come on.
I didnt have dinner.
- You want a drink?- Yep.
"Yep. Nope."
Should have been our wedding vows.
Im just tired.
No, youre not.
I dont understand.
Ive heard you saya lot worse things about advertising.
The mighty theaterpunches its audience in the face
with its subtle message.Theres a challenge.
Let me tell you, people buy thingsbecause it makes them feel better.
We could have had dinner with Charles.
Hes an understudy.That may be his only performance.
I dont mind picking upthe check for your friends,
- but not if they insult me first.- Im sorry.
People make fun of acting all the time,and you love it.
And I didnt think it wassuch a strong stand against advertising
as much as the emptiness of consumerism.
No ones made a stronger standagainst advertising than you.
You know, I was scared when Bea was born,but shes such a joy.
I actually sawher face float by while I was chanting.
Really? You had a vision?
I guess.
And you kind of thinkyoure tied to this person forever.
Not my little girl. You know, Jennifer.
And now with another one on the way...
I want a family with Lakshmi.
And a farm, maybe outside Frisco.
Youre gonna have to doa little less recruiting
and a little more working.
About that...
I dont have a job for you, Paul.Ive thought about that.
Its the whole reasonI didnt wanna see you.
But you can help mebecause I have been working.
Youve been writing?
I think this is the most meaningfulwork Ive ever done in my life.
Its a speculative episodeof the hit television show Star Trek.
Are you kidding me?
I think it should betheir season opener next year.
If there is one.
Its a tough time slot.My Three Sons, Bewitched,
- that things a juggernaut.- Itll be there.
Where the hell do you watch it?
Through the windowof a pizza parlor on MacDougal.
- What, do you lip-read?- Ive seen the show,
and I think Ive made a good effortat matching the moral complexities
tinged with adventurethat draw people to it.
Just read the first 15 pages.
If you dont thinkits good enough for network television,
then you dont have topass it along to the executives at NBC
or even think about tryingto get it to Mr. Roddenberry.
Thats kind of a line you dont cross, Paul.
Who do you think youre talking to?
How much do you buy at NBC?You dont have any leverage?
Okay.
- Is it about Hare Krishna?- No.
Not literally,but they dont tell literal stories.
Look, you had a vision your first time.
Not that I wasnt in a state of blissfor the first few months,
but something happened.
I try to clear my head, but I cant.
Its too busy in there.
Everybody else looks so happy.
You know, I got thereand I started trying to figure out
who Prabhupad likes best.
Its the same as everywhere I go.
He doesnt like me.
No one likes me.
Sometimes I think Krishnadoesnt even like me.
No one but Lakshmi.
Will you read the script?
Can I ask you something?
Why didnt you bring in Paul Kinseywhen you hired Ginsberg?
He wasnt submitted.
- You didnt consider him?- Was I supposed to?
As far as I know, he was at McCann,
and then Y&R, then he rolleddownhill through K&E and B&B.
And last thing I heard,he was in-house at A.M.P.
Whos A.M.P.?
No, Im sorry. The A.M.P.
Will you read a scripthe wrote for Star Trek?
Harry, if he asked you to pass it along,
I dont think this is what he meant.
I know what he meant,but I need a second opinion.
Arent you curious?
Is it going to give me a caseof the "nee-groan complex"?
Its really bad.
And its pronounced "neh-grahn"because it rhymes with "katahn,"
which the negronpick under slavery to the caucasons.
Thats a twist.
No, the twist is that the negron are white.
Great. Now Im notgonna get anything done.
He really hopes this will change his life.
What am I gonna do?
You really wanna help him, dont you?
So what?Really, do you know how lucky we are?
If you really wanna help,
be honest with him and tell himhe needs to write a better script.
I think it was really hard for him.
Then he shouldnt be doing it.
Mr. Campbell to see you.
Send him in.
So whats your favorite Jaguar?
Did you send over a packet?
No, I drove them.
Someone drove me.
I dont know how to operate a stick shift.
Ill go this afternoon.
See that you do, because your opinionmeans a lot more than mine.
Take Megan.See how they deal with a couple.
Well see.
You know, if I told you last December thatwed be in the running for a car,
you would have kissed me on the mouth.
Maybe you and I should go as a couple.
Well, that is good to hear.
Pity having to depletethe resources this time of year,
but it had to be done.
Ive been assured the funds shouldbe accessible immediately.
Very well.
There is the matter of my fee.
Yes, of course.
After the holidays? Good day.
Joan, you have a guest in reception.
He needs a signature.
Are you Joan Harris?
Yes, thats me.
- Youre served.- What?
Damn it.
Why did you let him in?
- He said he needed to talk to you.- About what?
I dont remembereverything everybody says.
Because youre an idiot!
Dont talk to me like that.
Do you understand having you out hereis the same as having no one?
He said he knew you.He said it was a surprise.
A surprise?
Thank you for that. Heres a surprise!
- Joan!- Surprise!
Theres an airplane here to see you!
Youre not allowed to do that.
- Come on.- Stop it.
- Whats going on?- Nothing.
- Come with me.- Im fine.
Don.
Come on, lets go.
Its too early for lunch.
- Were not going to lunch.- I dont even have my coat.
Look at your watch.
Well, hello.
What brings you in today?
We got tired of waiting for a cab.
Thought wed buy a car.
Lets see if I can get out of your way.
Whats this one?
Its the Mark II.
Its roomy, quiet,good for a night on the town,
but can also accommodate children.
Do you have any?
Altogether, four.
This is a car for the American road.
Its too much power for England.
They dont have the space.
Yeah, plus I hear the dampness ism*rder on the electrical system.
Weve worked that out.
Honey. Whats that?
Thats the most beautiful car ever made.
The XKE, or the E-Type.
I want one.
Im thinking aboutpaying to have you drive around in this.
Go get me the keys.Ill drive her around for free.
Ill have to take you out one at a time.
Theres no room for three.
Why would we want you along?
She really wants me to take it for a ride.
I cant.
She can drive it herself.
So youre going to ride with her?
Can I?
How much is the car?
That one?
$5,600.
Heres $6,000.
If we dont come back, consider it paid for.
I dont know what it is.That car does nothing for me.
Its because youre happy.You dont need it.
Okay.
You do not knowhow hard Ive tried to ignore this at work.
I know what Im doing, I have some control,
but then he found a way to ruin that, too.
Youre gonna need to definesome of these pronouns
if you want me to keep listening.
Dr. Captain Harris served mewith papers in the office.
Hes divorcing me.
Like he has the moral high ground.
Its hard on a marriage when youre apart.
Really? He loves it.
Im sorry about that girl, but, you know...
It used to beif someone needed to see me in reception,
they were delivering flowers.
Those flowers...
God, my first week hereI thought you were dating Ali Khan.
My mother raised me to be admired.
But no flowers from you.
You scared the shit out of me.
Burt Peterson told meyou were the one person in the agency
I shouldnt cross.
He and Freddy had a standing argumentthat you were a lesbian.
You think they neverbrought that up with me?


Congratulations.
For what?
For getting divorced.
Nobody realizes how bad it has to getfor that to happen.
Now you get to move on.
To what?
To start over? With a baby?
On what date do you share that news?
Right after you go all the way.
Youll find somebody better.
You did, didnt you?
You found someone perfect.
I did.
I feel like the office misses her.
Maybe I should have kept her at reception.
I dont think you shouldhave thrown those papers out the window.
Give me some change. I want music.
Hello?
Theres a Lakshmi here to see you.
Shes got a whole story.
Bring her back.
Scarlett, please hold all my calls.
A pleasure to see you.I hope you understand,
Jennifer wants to bevery thorough in our search for a nanny.
Thank you, Meredith.
If this is some kind of shakedown,let me stop you right now.
I know youre trying to recruit me.
Can I have a drink?
Isnt that verboten?
Listen to me.
I dont know what it is,
but when you were chanting, I felt this...
Intensity, you know?
Everywhere on my body...
Especially one place.
Really?
I was in such a state.
Stop it. I thought you were with Paul.
Nobodys with anybody.
Paramatma does what he wants and so do I.
It doesnt mean thatwe dont love each other.
So theres no reason for you to say no.
What about the fact that Im married?
Im burning for you.
Does your wife burn for you?
So this is completely allowed?
Take me like this.
Not even a little Sinatra?
Jimmy Durante.
Look at all these peopledancing to my music.
You wanna dance?
I dont think we should.
You sure look like you wanna dance.
You and me in Midtown?
You with that look on your face?
What look, baby?
God, youre irresistible.
You know what this womansaid to me once?
"I like being bad
"and going home and being good."
I bet that stuck to your ribs.
It was a disaster.
And you enjoyed every minute of it.
God, I miss that.
Theres a gentleman over at seven-thirty
who looks like he wants to dance.
Who do you think he is?
Advertising?
Insurance?
Lawyer?
And who do you thinks waiting at home?
I bet shes not ugly.
The only sin shes committedis being familiar.
So you think its all him?
Because she cant give him what he wants.
Because he doesnt know what he wants,
what hes wanting.
He knows.
Its just the way he is.
And maybe its just the way she is.
Im gonna go.
- I can still drive, I think.- I can drive.
You can stay.
Ive been sitting with yousince he walked in.
Poor me, I struck out.
Whos gonna believe that?
Carfare,
in case it doesnt work out.
Mad money.
Thank you.
Good night, sweetheart.
Stand over by the jukebox.
That looked pretty good before.
Are you okay?
I dont know. I...
My hearts b*at like a rabbit.
Smokings not gonna help.
Dont get all strict on me, Mother Lakshmi.
But I am strict.
I did this for the movement.
Good to know, but I aint joining.
Although your techniquesare more persuasive than...
Pauls.
Youre disgusting.
Im only here because I dont want youshaking his devotion.
What? How does that work?
Youre the worst girlfriend in the world.
And youre the best friend.
Thats why youre giving him false hopefor his awful teleplay.
He wants to have a life with you.
And you know that evenif that was possible, thats not the way.
Look, he doesnt know that.
So why dont you just let him go?
Because hes a devotee of the Lord.
Youre just a karmi and a sense enjoyer.
You wanna make himinto a gross materialist
when hes living in the spiritual world.
And also hes our best recruiter.
I mean, he really can close.
So Im confused. Why did we just do that?
Because youre going to stay away from him
and let him be happyin the light of Krishna consciousness.
You thought I was some confused little girl?
Im trading the only thing I have.
But you already gave it away.
Stay away from him.
What do I do about the script?
Tell him the truth.
That always works.
Youre drunk.
And you left work at lunch.
Where the hell were you?
You wanna get the rolling pin?
What the hell?
I wanna know where you were.
I left work, I test-drove a Jaguar,
had a drink with Joan,drove around some more and dropped it off.
And you never thought to call me?
Why did you want me to think that?
Calm the hell down.
I put a plate in the oven for you
and sat here like an idiot,waiting for someone
who doesnt give a shit about anybody.
- You like to get mad.- No, I dont.
- Thats what gets you going.- That is not what this is.
Now sit down!
Youre gonna eat dinner with me.
Do you want any cheese?
- No. Do you want...- Ill clean it up later.
You used to love your work.
Well, its different there now.
You loved it before you ever met me.
My mother is not a good nurseand he hides his symptoms.
Hes a rugged chap.
I do think more than everwe should pay them a visit at Christmas.
Or I could just take Nigel.
Certainly we can afford that.
I shouldnt be sharing this,but I truly dont want you to go.
You see, Edwins left Jaguar.
Thats why she left in a hurry.
If he had been sacked,hed have lost his visa.
Yes, well, it allowed Jaguarto come crawling back to me.
The firm cant do it without meand I shant spend another Christmas alone.
Darling.
Im so happy for you, so proud.
Of course well be here by your side.
Christmas in New York will do just fine.
Dont get excited.
Well, get excited, but theyre not from me.
Thank you for delivering them.
I had to. The girl in receptionis too scared to bring them back.
I also had to sign for themand tip handsomely.
Do you want a tip, too?
How many times have I left you alonewith a card from another man?
Hare Krishna.
Great to see you. Well?
Ive been meditating on the ideathat you have good news,
especially since you called me so fast.
Then I realized its probably not,since you wouldnt tell me over the phone.
I have news, but its complicated.
They loved it. They said it was oneof the best scripts they had ever read.
Who?
The reader at Mike Weinblatts office.
But he apparently cant give it to Mike
or anyone over therebecause of legal reasons.
And you can never call himbecause theyve had some lawsuits,
but he said you have a futureand I agree with him.
Did you tell him Ill get a lawyer?Ill sign anything they want.
Yes, but he was firmly discouragingin every way
except in his unbridled enthusiasmfor the writing.
Really? What did he say?
Can I talk to him?Does he want to talk to me?
Never.
But...
In this envelope is your future.
This is your destiny.
Is it a contract?
Theyre not interested.
But I am.
This is $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles.
I want you to leave the Krishnasand go out there and try.
I dont think Lakshmi...
Im not giving you this unless you promise
to leave your things and go from here.
I dont have any things.
Good. This is all you need.
You dont understandwhat its like out there.
This failure, this life...
Itll all seemlike it happened to someone else.
Harry, you dont understand Lakshmi.
If you go back there,youll never be strong enough to go.
And then shell try and talk you out of it.And what does that tell you?
Its $500. You can call her on the wayfrom Philly or something.
You know, all these people saidtheyd do something for me.
Youre the first one who did.
Break a leg.
Everyones assemblingfor the announcement.
Well, theres a little bad newsto go with the good.
Mohawks machinists are going on strike.
Despite the fact that theyre flying,
theyre suspending their advertising.
They made so much money all summeras scabs.
- Whats going on?- Mohawks on strike.
Theyre suspending all work.
Theyre not leaving the agency,
but what they save by cutting the ad budget
goes straight to the bottom line,and its the end of the year.
Then therell be no bonuses.
No!
No Christmas bonuses three years in a row?
I know.
Theyre going to be workingall through the holidays on Jaguar.
Fine. Just the partners will defer.
Even the junior partners?
Yes, till the end of January.
Thats prudent.
Well, here we go.
Don, you up to joining us?
Lane, go ahead.
Well, we have a few announcements,
the first of which is
that we have received some bad newsfrom Mohawk Airlines
that they will be suspendingtheir work indefinitely.
This puts significant financial strainon the company.
It was our plan to distributeChristmas bonuses this year,
but quite selflessly the partnershave elected to forego their share
in the interests of rewarding the stafffor a job well done.
Youre all getting Christmas bonusesand we arent.
Now, understandthat the financial straddling required
is for a very good reason.
Weve been includedin an elite group of agencies
invited to pitch Jaguar cars.
So congratulations.
Anything else?
Yes, actually, Id like to say something.
Would you?
Last year at this time,whether you knew it or not,
the survival of this companywas on the line.
I look at the faces in this roomwho have given their all
to this tenuous recovery and I say,
prepare to take a great leap forward.
Prepare to swim the English Channeland then drown in champagne.
There are six weekendsbetween now and the pitch.
We are going to spend them all here.
We will celebrate Christmas here.
We will ring in the new year together.
And in the end, we will represent Jaguar,and it will be worth it.
Every agency on Madison Avenue
is defined by the moment they got their car.
When we land Jaguar,the world will know weve arrived.
Creative, in my office.
