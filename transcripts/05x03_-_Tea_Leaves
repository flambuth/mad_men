Betty, are you ready?
Its stuck.
What about now?
Betty!
Ill get it. Just go.
Betty? The car is here.
Whats going on? Weve got to go.
Darling, I just dont thinkI can go tonight.
Whats the matter?
Its a womans thing.
Is there any way you could play with pain?
Its the Junior League of New York.I dont want to do it without you.
Your mother will be there.Itll be very endearing.
Forgive me on the way?
Thank you.
Say au revoir.
Bonjour, Marie.
Marie, I cant understand you.
- Moustiques?- Mosquitoes.
We cant let Heinz b*at us there.
He has a name, you know.
And do you know what that is?
Are you kidding me?
Hes the only manI want to please more than you.
And your father.
Im the baby. They miss me.
So, Megan, youre French. I supposeI should ask you what looks good.
Im Canadian.Although, for all we know, they are, too.
You know, back in Pittsburgh,
everybody is pretty muchwho you expect them to be.
Or you know them forever.
Raymond and I met in high school.
Well, then weve beenmarried longer than you.
- I told you he was smooth.- How did you two meet?
- Well...- At work.
Don was divorced.
Well, thats none of my business.
You have a teenage daughter, Emily.
- Hows her summer?- Its tough.
Shes around the house all the time.
Too old for camp, too young for a job.
- I say let her enjoy it.- I agree.
You dont sound so happy about itwhen I get home.
Well, the music is so loud.
Do you know the Rolling Stones, Don?
- Sure.- The Stones.
She cant get enough of them.
The other night, shes playing this song,"Time, time is on your side..."
- Time Is On My Side.- Yes, it is, dear.
Well, its catchy. And I was thinking,what if they were to sing, you know,
"Heinz, Heinz, Heinz is on my side"?
Or something like that. I dont know.
Theyre gonna be in New York.
Emily almost jumped in our bags with uswhen she heard we were coming.
Maybe you could, you know,get them to record it while theyre here.
Well, thats not exactly the way it works,but we can certainly approach them.
This is boring. Am I right, Megan?
Yes.
Clara, where is Roger?
Caroline says the meeting is in his office.
- You wanted to see me?- I was waiting in my office
to give you some good news.
Drinking good news?
Mohawk called.
Youre welcome.
They havent informed their agency,but Im told its a matter of hours.
Welcome back, suckers.
I think you should handle the account.
- So, they asked for me.- They enjoy your company.
And since you were here when they werehere, they think you know their business.
I know Hank from the w*r. He likes vodka.
Jack likes Jack. Anything else?
So youre aware theyve taken on$54 million in debt to replace their planes
and theres a mechanic strike looming?
- Although theyll likely be spared.- So far, so good.
Don and I have beentrying to explain to Lane
this is a daily businessand well need a dedicated copywriter.
I dont understandwhy Miss Olson cant handle it.
Because these guys aregonna ask her to make drinks.
Were still paying Don, arent we?
Dons not going to write local fare adsthree times a week.
Thats all it is?
Just get a guy with basic retail experienceand run with it.
Congratulations.
Lane, smile. Weve got an airline.
Morning. Im here to see Don.
Yes, just a minute.Mr. Draper, Mr. Crane to see you.
Just a minute, Dawn.
Is Don in a meeting?
Hes with Mrs. Draper.
Thank you, Dawn.
Youre welcome.
Its so confusing.
People keep saying that,but we havent had any problems.
You havent. But out in the office,its really hard to tell whos who.
- Hello, Harry.- Good morning.
Backstage, Forest Hills Tennis Stadium,Saturday night,
put your hands togetherfor the Rolling Stones.
And how would you gauge their interest?
The manager sounded greedy.I thought wed take one car.
- Ill drive.- It starts at 8:00,
but apparently theyre always late.I thought we could grab a bite.
Theres a dynamite Italian restaurantwith a first-rate veal parm.
- Nope.- Good.
Then I will be ready at 7:30, having eaten.
Have Dawn pencil it in.
- Hello, Pauline.- Hello, dear.
I just wanted to see how you were feeling.
Arent you sweet tocome all the way over here
when a phone call would have sufficed.
Are the children home?
Theyre at day camp. You know that.
Betty, you were sorely missed last night.
Well, thats good to hear, I guess.
Youve missed a bunch of these, Betty.
- Pauline...- And Im sure he never shows it,
but it upsets Henry when youre not there.
I want him to be happy.And you being with him is part of that.
I wasnt feeling well.
Honey, I know how it happens.
You get comfortable,and you give up a little bit,
and then it just gets out of control.
There are things you can do about this.
There are pills you can take.
Why havent you taken them?
Believe me, I would if I could.
I have a heart condition.
And honestly, at my age,I dont have to please men anymore.
But you...
Dont you want to get back intothat incredible closet of yours again?
Itll be easy for you.
Youre just one of those girls.
Thank you, Dawn.
- Whats so funny?- She was the most qualified.
Weve got great news,but assume this is for your ample ears only.
Is it about Heinz and the Rolling Stones?
- What?- No.
Harrys such a liar.
Baked beans and the Rolling Stones.
A clients idea if I ever heard one.
Mohawk Airlines is returning.
Thats great. Thats a big fish.
Its a minnow, but its our minnow.
Well, I obviously have experience,I mean, at a low level,
but I saw how it worked.
Your plate is full,
and, frankly, Mohawk is going toinsist on a regular copywriter.
- Someone with a penis.- Ill work on that.
Call in books. Youre the search committee.
- Okay, when?- Immediately.
Now, this is gonna be my account,
so I dont want just some hackwith retail experience.
He should be brilliant and have awards.
I want you to bring mea good-looking version of Don.
Thatll be easy.
- Mrs. Francis.- Hello.
So nice of you to see me so quickly.
Well, slow day.
What seems to be the problem?
Well, its just that Ive been wondering...
Ive put on a few pounds
and I havent had much luckreducing on my own for some reason.
Well, with middle-aged women, it gets easierto put it on and harder to take it off.
Well,
a friend told me itd be easierif you gave me diet pills.
Just to give me a little jump-start.
Is your friend a doctor?
No.
Well, Im not going to give youa prescription without giving you an exam.
What, for diet pills?
If you think its necessary.
Mrs. Francis, when a housewifehas a rapid weight gain,
the cause is usually psychological.
Unhappiness, anxiety, boredom,things that cause us to lose our self-control.
But first,
we have to rule outdiabetes, hyperthyroidism...
I dont need to take the pills forever.
I dont like that.
What?
Could you swallow?
Henry!
Mrs. Francis is on line one.
- Betts, you there?- Don.
- I dont know what to do.- About what?
I went to the doctor this morningand he found this thing.
Its a node or a nodule
or something, and its on my thyroid.
And they dont know what it is,but its a lump, Don.
And hes sending me to the cityto some specialist for tests.
Okay, okay, calm down.
I cant, Don. I cant.
Betts, what exactly did he say?
Nothing. You know how they are.
Do you want me to take the kids?
The kids.
The kids. Oh, God.
Birdie.
Say what you always say.
Everythings gonna be okay.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
If I see one more Volkswagen adwith something else in it...
You can do an ad on anything you want.Dont pick toilet paper, shitbird.
Too fat.
Too thin.
Shelly Parker.Might be a woman, God forbid.
Irony. Thats promising.
Have I lost my sense of smell,or is this good?
Thats bitching.
Whats this guys name?
"Michael Ginsberg."
Nice knowing you, Mike.
What are you doing?Thats the best one Ive seen.
This is why girls dont play sports.
Youve been working on Heinzfor four months.
Somebody else is gonnacarry the ball across the goal line?
Bringing him in for Mohawk.
I hope you like him.Hes gonna be your boss someday.
I like working with talented people.It inspires me.
Im not talking about me.Im talking about another writer.
Are you suddenly not competitive?
The chick who races people to the toilet?
Im going to bring him in.
Stick to mediocre. Youll sleep better.
Can I come in?
Of course.
I just got off the phone with Jim.He said tomorrow at 11:00.
Tomorrow?
My boss made a call.
You told Mayor Lindsay?
Hes got bigger secrets than this, Betty.
- I dont know if tomorrow...- You want to wait on this?
- Well, if it is something...- If, if, if.
Betty, lets not play that game, okay?
Come to bed.
You want some brandy?
I see you all the time. Youre beautiful.
Youre sweet.
Im gonna have a brandy.
Betty.
Betty Draper. I almost didnt recognize you.
Joyce, hello. How are you?
Not good. Im here.
Mrs. Francis, the doctors waiting.
Its Francis now.
My husbands name is Henry, too, actually.
Look, you know what?
Im gonna be in radiology forever.
Mrs. Darling, theyre waiting for you, too.
Why are you here?
You want to get some lunch after?
I dont know. My husbands picking me up.
You think you dont want tohave lunch, but you do.
Okay.
Okay, okay. Im going.
Hello. Im Peggy Olson.
Michael Ginsberg. Lead the way.
No, were meeting here.
So whats he like?Is he like a firm handshake kind of guy?
- Excuse me?- Don.
I want to make a good impression.You could help me out.
No, Im interviewing you. Im a copywriter.
Have a seat.
So, is Don stopping by?
No, its just me.
- Can you hire me?- Well, no, but Im the first round.
Wouldnt you want to talk tothe person who could hire you?
I spent three weeks dancing at thatcrappy New York satellite of Leo Burnett.
Never met him at all.Turns out Leos not a real person.
- Yes, he is.- Is Don a real person?
Cause Id really like to meet him.
Im the personyou need to impress right now.
You looked at my book.What more can I say?
Okay.
- I liked your work.- And I like your work.
You thought I was a secretary.Do you have a current resume?
- Allen Ginsberg?- Hes the most famous Ginsberg there is.
I figured we got to be related somehow.
And whats he gonna say?
Okay, well, it was nice meeting you.
Nuts. Listen, my stuff is good.
You can see advertising aint my day job.
Look, youre a fair woman.
I insulted you because Im honest.
And I apologized because Im brave.
I didnt pick this profession. It picked me.I didnt have any control over it.
Turns out its the only thing I can do.
- Your works very impressive, but...- Heres some other advantages...
I have no hobbies, no interests, no friends.
Im one of those peoplewho talks back to the radio.
No girlfriend, no family. I will live here.
Then youre like everyone else.
Ive never been accused of that,but I really am trying.
I dont know.
You cant act like this with Don.
Like what?
- Well call you.- Okay.
You know, your bookreally does have a voice.
Thats what they said about Mein Kampf.
The kid really has a voice.
- Youre sure youre okay just with tea?- Yes.
Everything tastes like sawdust to me.
Everything still tastes good to me.
Turns out I have the only kindthat makes you fatter.
Look, Im sure youre fine.
When do you find out the results?
I dont remember.
It wasnt until the third visit that I knew.
Because Hank was waiting there.
Have you told your children?
They know Im going to the doctor a lot,
and they know Im sick,but Ive always been in a bad mood, so...
I joke with Hank.He should just tell them I got hit by a car.
Itd be easier todeal with than saying goodbye.
The scene.
Im leaving behind such a mess.
Youre not going anywhere.
Hes my second husband.
His mothers domineering.
And Dons girlfriend...
Well, theyre married.
Shes 20 years old.
Theyll never heara nice word about me again.
Im sorry, but I have to ask you.
What is it like?
Well,
its like youre way out in the ocean,
alone, and youre paddling,
and you see people on the shore,but theyre getting farther and farther away.
And you struggle because its natural.
Then your mind wandersback to everything normal.
What am I gonna fix for dinner?Did I lock the back door?
And then you just get so tired,
you just give inand hope you go straight down.
Thats horrible.
No ones ever asked.
Hello, ladies.I am Cecillia, and I have the gift of sight.
Could I offer you a reading?
Youre gonna predict our future?
- Go ahead.- Really?
Its always good.
- Oh, my.- What?
Youre a great soul.
You mean so muchto the people around you.
Youre a rock.
Im sorry.
Were done. Thank you.
You need some more tea.
- Are you okay?- I had drinks with Mohawk.
I sat down with two of themand I swear by the end there were three.
Did you hire him?
No, he was crazy. Im calling in more books.
Define crazy for a copywriter.
Sleeps all day, disrespectful of authority,drunk half the time. Did he smell like pee?
- Who smells like pee?- Writers. Just hire him.
I cant. Don will hate him.Hes certifiable.
I order you to bring him in.
You have to. I already told Mohawk.
Why would you do that?
I wanted to smooth the groundabout working with a Jew.
Turns out everybodys got one now.
Tell you the truth,it makes the agency more modern.
Between that and its always darkestbefore the dawn over there.
At least this one were hiring on purpose.
I can find another Jew,if thats what you care about.
Look, I know what youre afraid of.
Sweetheart, no ones gonna replace you.
Im not threatened by his talent.Hes not that good.
I just think Don will hate him,and then hell hate me.
Ill be there. Ill handle Don.
- How can you hear anything?- Im following your advice.
Im being bathed in commercials.
My God, youre so square,youve got corners.
I have to make sure I look like the man.
If Betty calls, you know, or the kids,tell them Ill call them in the morning.
What did she want anyway?
Who knows?
Well, have fun.
And I dont mean that.
This is backstage.Thats the real backstage.
Nice to see you.
- Were here to see the Rolling Stones.- Theyre not here.
Well, actually, were here tosee their manager, Allen Klein.
- Hes not here either.- Im Harry Crane. Im on the list.
Theres no list.
Will you let us know when they get here?
Sir, I promise youll know.
Should have talked himout of this at the dinner table.
Well, we either wait for them to show upor wait for them to come out of there.
Hey, mister, tell your friend Ill trade hima joint for a cigarette.
You can have one for free.
No, I just wanted to make sureyou guys werent cops.
Can you light this for me?
- Theres a cop right over there.- Hes cool.
- What are you doing?- Theyre cool.
They dont look cool.
- What are you two doing here?- Were here on business.
- What kind of business?- Advertising.
Like Bewitched?
Youre Derwood and hes Mr. Kravitz.
Are you sure you want to?
Its been too long.
I thought thats what you wanted.
You know who has the best stuff?
- Charlton Heston.- Whos that?
We went to his house, he came out naked.
Hes a very good-looking man.
I guess if I looked like that,I would be naked a lot, too.
In fairness,I dont think he knew we were there.
It was kind of an impromptu meeting.
We wanted him to be the voice of VapoRub.
Right? Wouldnt that be perfect?
She just said she doesnt know who he is.
Come on, theyre letting us in.I told them how important you are.
- Thank you.- No, just Harold.
- Whod you tell them I was?- Just go.
Hey, hes getting me in, not you.
Ill send for you.
She knows what shes doing.
You really thinkyoure gonna get the Rolling Stones
- to do a TV ad?- They did one for cereal in England.
It must have been a long time ago.
It was three years ago.When you were probably, what, 11?
You see someone do that in a movie?
You need to relax.
So what do you like so muchabout the Rolling Stones?
Why dont you get me backstageand youll see?
What do you feel when you hear them?
Brian Jones.
Hes a troubadour.
So you feel romantic.
God, youre like a psychiatrist.
What do you know about psychiatrists?
Do you have a business cardor something I could try on the doorman?
Ill make breakfast.
If, if, if.
You know what? I am hungry.
Im so sorry, sweetheart.
So what do you think? They gonna show?
Stop looking at your watch.Theyre gonna come when they come.
Theyre gonna come right down that hallwayand Im gonna jump on Brian like Jack Ruby.


And what do you expect to happen?
Ill get into that dressing room
and Im gonna stare at himwhile he tunes his guitar.
Hell see me from across the room.
Im Lady Jane. Hell know that.
Then what are you gonna do?
I dont know. Whatever he wants.
And what do you think he wants?
None of you want any of us to havea good time just cause you never did.
No, were worried about you.
Got it! I got it!
They want to do it.I have never seen people more excited.
Wait, you met them?
- Theyre here. Theyre here.- Theyre here.
Who were you talking to?
They even sounded just like themwhen they were singing.
They played for me.
Im sorry I failed, Don.
We can try again tomorrow. Asbury Park?
Forget it. Manager looked right through us.
You want the last one?
There were 20.
I thought you were getting itfor your family.
You know what? Let them get their own.
You bring home a bag of food and theygo at it, and theres nothing left for you.
Eat first.
Thats my recommendation to people whosay theyre getting married and having kids.
Eat first.
- Sure you dont want it?- Harry, you have to go.
Just let me sit here for a second.
I have to get home.
Those girls, Don.
Those young girls.
They are so much fun.
Everybodys having fun.Theyre all on drugs.
Youre on drugs.
You signed the Tradewinds.Who the hell are they?
Just go inside.
What are we gonna tell Raymond?
That the Rolling Stonesarent good for Heinz.
Yeah.
His daughterjust probablywanted to meet them.
I dont think theyre good for her, either.
Im gonna leave the bag.Jennifer has me on a diet.
- We should do this again.- Bye, Harry.
I waited as long as I could,but weve got to go.
Really?
Drink too much with the Stones?
No, we didnt get to meet them.
Well, youll have plenty of time to tell me.It takes forever to get to Fire Island.
Did Betty call?
No. Lets go.
Megan.
What?
I have to tell you something.
- What happened?- Its Betty.
She might be sick. Really sick.
What?
They found a tumor.
Thats terrible.
Why didnt you tell me?
I didnt know how youd react.
What, did you think Id be happy?
I dont know what I thought.I just knew she wouldnt want you to know.
Well, it affects me.
Theres a possibility that its nothing.
And if its something, well deal with it.
- You know I love Sally, and...- No, no, no.
I dont want to have that conversation.
Great. Then lets go.Your trunks on the dresser.
No.
I just cant.
Megan, you are 26 years old.
So I dont understand death?
I understand you went tothat concert last night,
but now its suddenly too overwhelmingwhen were supposed to go see my friends.
Come on.
Theres nothing you can do.
Its okay.
This is very provocative.
That one. I was at the movies.
Well, not the movies.I was in Times Square at a peep show.
- Shouldnt we wait for Roger?- For what?
He doesnt even come to the meetingsthat are important.
- Go on.- Theres a resume in there.
Okay.
So you were at Needham for a long timeand a lot of other places for a short time.
I checked his references thoroughlyor I wouldnt have brought him in.
Would you let him talk?
Im opinionated,but I know if you were my boss,
I would have no problem saying,"Okay, Don."
Unless you want me to call you Mr. Draper.I worked for someone like that.
- Kirk Whitby?- Im not gonna say.
You wouldnt want me runningall over town telling your secrets.
Well, I wouldnt want yougrumbling behind my back, either.
Youre right. I shouldnt have said that.
I just wanted to make you smile.
Ill be honest.
Ive admired you since the letter.
I thought it was the funniest thingI ever read.
And the fact that I can say "The letter"and everyone knows what Im talking about.
I just want to be a part of this place.
I think its on the way up.
Between you and Margaret,
shes very interesting.
And I think I made it clear, so are you.
Pleasure to meet you, Michael.
Good work.
Thanks.
Promise me you didnt justhire the handsomest one.
Anything else?
Get him set up and let him haggle with Lane.
Roger, I see youve met Mr. Ginsberg.
Yeah, turns out we both have a dream ofthrowing something through this window.
- Howd it go?- Good.
See? Im proud of you.
Mr. Ginsberg, follow me.
Im sorry. My stomach rumbles sometimesand it can sound like the "F" word.
You know, I thought you were crazywhen I met you,
and you have confirmed it bynot acting the way that you acted with me.
You told me not to act that way.
And the fact that you can control itreally scares me.
So Im not getting the job?
No, you start tomorrow.
I would like to pick you upand spin you around right now,
but I dont want people to thinkthats how I got the job.
Well, Im glad youre excited.
Come on, be proud of me. I need it.
Nobody in the world caresI got the job but you.
Then Im happy.
I cant believe this.
You should have just gone into work.
Come on.
- Do you want me to turn down the TV?- Its fine.
Henry Francis.
Well, tell JimHis Honor is not going to Michigan.
Because Romneys a clownand I dont want him standing next to him.
Because hes got a city to run.
Can we talk later?
Francis residence.
This is Betty.
Okay.
Yes.
Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Its benign.
I knew it.
Im so happy.
Youre okay, you know.
I feel like I just got offa boat from China.
Hey, everythings okay.
No, its good. Its good.
Its nice to be put through the wringerand find out Im just fat.
Betty, come on.
Youre exhausted.
Thats what it is, isnt it?
I dont know how many ways to tell you,
but I dont see it.
I know.
- Your mothers obese.- Hey.
Listen to me,I feel like Ive been given a gift.
Like Scrooge seeing his tombstone.
Oh, my God, this is what it could be.But its not gonna be.
Saturday night was fun.
Okay.
Id like to say thatIve gathered you all here
so you may rememberhow small this agency once was.
Mohawk Airlines has chosen to returnto Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Now, now.
Im just pleased that after a long effort,I was able to sign them.
Ive also hired a new copywriter
and look forward to great success,with your help.
And, of course, Mr. Sterlingwill be handling the day to day.
But rest assured,everything he knows, Ill know.
You gonna break that over its nose?
Forget everything I said before.
- Excuse me?- Thats the last guy I hired.
Hey.
- Roger.- What?
Little prick dangled it in front of meand took it away.
It was disrespectful.
You know, I used to love that kid.
I would hold his handand help him up on the swing set.
He grew up.
- What did you expect?- Im tired of it, Don.
Im tired of trying to prove I still haveany value around here.
Im exhausted from hanging onto the ledgeand having
some kids foot on my fingertips.
b*mb away.
Betty has cancer.
Really?
I dont know.
Theyre waiting on tests.
Well, that would solve everything.
You want me to make a call?
She probably knows already.
Im the one that has to call.
Shes a fighter.
Come on.
I just imagine themgrowing up without a mother.
I never had one.
Megan will try,
but what are they gonna do?
How does that end up?
Actual life and death.
Ive given up on that.
I cant do that.
When is everythinggonna get back to normal?
- Henry Francis.- Hi, Henry. Its Don.
Hello, Don.
I wanted to know if there was any news
about Betty.
I didnt realize she...
Shes fine. Shes out of the woods.
- Well, thats great news.- It is.
You know, were aboutto put supper on the table.
Ill let you go.
Who was it?
Nobody.
Bettys fine.
Im glad to hear it.
Youre such an optimist.
She just needs to havesomething to call you about.
Take you to dinner?
Sure.
Pete Fox died.
Fifty-seven years old, for crying out loud.
I dont know who that is, Pop.
Red Sox.
Right field, he played.
I got the job.
You dont say.
What do you want to eat?
What do I want to eat?
We should get girls.
An old one and a young one.
I got a rye bread and some farmer cheese.
Look at me.
What are you doing?
Come on.
- Dont you like it?- Its good.
Arent you going to finish?
Im full.
Can I watch TV?
Go ahead.
