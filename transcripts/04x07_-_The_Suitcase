...Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11.
Thats two for the Campbells...
Where are these exactly?
Its a movie theater,no bad seats...
the Cosgroves,
and Joey, Stan, Danny... $10 each.
How come we have to pay
when everyone knows damnwell they were free?
Youre such a Jew.
Your friends in Hollywoodknow you talk that way?
And let me tell you-youre the Jew,
trying to make 30 bucks onsomething you got for free.
25 on Clay by a knockout.
Liston is favored for a reason.
- Cassius Clay is scared.- Of what, pray tell?
He had an elevated heartrate before the last fight.
Who says that means youre scared?
It happens to me all the time.It runs in my family.
Liston has the weight.And hes never been knocked out.
Sonnys old.
Hes experienced.
Don, Ive got your ticket.
You want to put something down?
Stans got a barber who makes book.
Yeah, who do you like?
I was just saying
I think Clayd makeone hell of an adman.
Youre right. Gimme 100 on Liston.
Joining us for a littlepre-fight steak and cocktails
at the palm?
Absolutely. Samsonite team,in my office.
Listen, if it comesup with Jennifer,
I did pay for the seats.
Can you make a dinnerreservation before the bout
for Mr. Sterling and meanywhere but the palm?
I dont know why everyonecares so much about it.
If I wanted to seetwo negroes fight,
Id throw a dollarbill out my window.
I thought we were doingthis at 9:00. Its 11:15.
Im late, but youre not.Good work so far.
- Where do you want me?- Behind the desk is fine.
Youre in a white studio,like in some limbo.
Theres two no-namefootball players holding
an American tourister and a skyway
going against Mr. Joe Namath
and his defender, a sexy girl
holding a samsonite,and maybe a referee.
So we hear "hut hut,hike!" Namath fades back.
"Oh no, its a blitz!"...
punch in on Namath,he says something like...
"The secret to victoryon the road is samsonite.
I carry it because its tough
and no matter what comes at me,I know Im protected."
As they fall,
the competitors will bust open,clothing flying out.
Touchdown, samsonite!
- "Ive got it, honey."- "You sure do, Joe."
"Samsonite... its tough."
Endorsements are lazy,
and I dont like Joe Namath.
He hasnt even played ina professional game yet.
Hes very handsome.
And women dont buy suitcases.
Dr. faye says they do.
Could you leave us, please?
Peggy, Im glad that this is an environment
where you feel free to fail.
You wanted to go with Dannys idea.
Because it works...
"only samsonite is tough."
Its the executionthats the problem.
- Okay, should it be funny?- Actually funny?
Maybe. Funny likewhat I just saw? No.
- Hello.- You remembered my birthday.
Did you open my present?
I am. Hold on.
My goodness.
Im finally doing what Ishouldve done years ago.
Phillips-Olson- something probably,
but Ill need you.I want to form an agency
that specializes inwomens products with you
as my creative director.
I dont know what to say.
But youre smiling, right?
I have some very-sort of a little under the table,
but very high-level talkswith the people at tampax.
Peggy, its tampax-50% market share.
I mean theyre really up there.
Plus that q*eer at belle jolie
has been barking up my tree.
Plus I have myEuropean connections.
It sounds exciting.
The trains leavingthe station, honey.
Get onboard.
Where am I calling you?
Im in my office at home.
So you already told grey?
Im not wasting my talentsover there anymore.
Believe me, it was mutual.
Duck, did you lose your job?
Peggy, this is good.
Im not gonna lie.
I was a little inspiredby what Draper did.
Now I just need some accounts.
Its tough because, well...
its tough to get a credit line.
So what do you have so far?
I know its not a diamond necklace,
but I did spend somemoney on those cards.
And I appreciate the gesture.
Its just...
I dont know whetherto take this seriously,
because I suspectyouve been drinking.
Well, youre wrong.
I heard about the Clios.
I have to see you tonight.
I have plans.
What, with that Mark?Hes another one.
Duck, you are avaluable account man.
You have a bright future.
You just need to go to oneof those headhunters and...
- I need to see you, babe.- Dont do that.
Peg, Im falling apart.
Dont you knowyoure the last thing
that made me feelgood about myself?
Pull your hands outof your panties.
I cant talk right now....
I want to see you tonight.
You been farting in here?...
I have to go.
Were going to lunch.
I dont know if you could tell,but he hated it.
I was hating it toowhile we were doing it,
but not before. Im not gonna lie.
So were back to the drawing board.Still gotta eat.
Come on, its your birthday.
Well let you talk through lunch.
You got a call
while you were in thetoilet to the direct line...
Stephanie from California,
no last name. She says its urgent.
- Would you like me to place the call?- No, Ive got it.
Bad news. Our night is ruined.
I took care of that.
The kids are going to the palm.
We are going anywhere else.
Well, the brotherhood ofalcoholics anonymous...
Freddy and CalRutledge from Ponds...
will be joining us fordinner and the fight,
which means well have to
drink before dinner ifwe want to drink at all.
And then theres allthe talk about drinking
where they start withthe funny stories
and they end up crying.
Again.
15 months Ive beenwaiting for this fight.
$300. Liston has tolose by unconsciousness.
- Get rid of em.- I cant.
- I should work on samsonite.- Thats in two weeks.
Im gonna be in Florida.Now this is your job too.
- Lets go.- Im sorry. You can do that without me.
- Samsonite you cant.- Are you serious?
We can solve thisproblem with a flask.
No, I wouldnt begood company anyway.
Thats never bothered me before.
I dont know what it is,
but I look at the side of your neck
and I wish I had one ofthose James Bond pens
so I could jam a dart in it.
James Bond likes to travel.He goes all over the world.
He goes underwater.He met a girl underwater.
I think this is agood place to stop.
See you tomorrow.
Oh, great.
I dont like sitting at my desk
and looking into a garbage dump.
Although I am paid less,I am still not a janitor.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Doing something specialfor your birthday?
Mark is taking me to dinner...
the forum of the twelve caesars.
- Ooh.- Yes.
- How old are you?- 26 today.
Well, youre doing all right,arent you?
Well, hello.
- Did I hear its your birthday?- It is.
- How are you feeling?- Well, of course my days are
spent sleeping andvisiting the ladies room,
although its an incredible feeling
having this baby kick me.
Is it any differentthan living with Pete?
Youre witty.
I always assumed that,but it turns out its true.
Are you going to watch the fight?
Oh, yes. Ive been watching boxing
since I was a little girl.
My father loves bl*od sport.
Mr. Drapers looking for you.
Im sorry. I have to go.
Happy Birthday.
You know, 26 is still very young.
Have fun.
I want a rare steakand I want to see
those two men pound each other.
Cynthias at the restaurant.We should go.
What about Jennifer?
Oh, dont go in there. Dont do it.
- Shes dead.- Lets b*at it before its us.
- I was just on my way out.- Did you get California?
Do you want me totry before I depart?
Theres a time difference,you know.
I do, but it goes the other way.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Get in here.
Why dont you talk toJoan and get rid of her?
No, Joan knew exactly what I needed
and made sure that I got it.
So where are we on samsonite?
Well have something toshow you in the morning.
But the suspense is k*ll me.
Well, I kind of was on my way out.
Let me just see where we are.
I guess Ive got a minute.
Okay. We thought that samsonite is
this very rare element,this mythical substance,
the hardest on earth-and we see an adventurer
leaping through a cave.
Is this a substancemuch like bullshit?
I thought we could dropone off the eiffel tower
with a countdown-like the moonshot...
and show how it doesnt break.
- But it would, wouldnt it?- Probably.
The government has prohibited us
from doing things like that, Peggy.
They feel that it is notin the public interest.
We have a thing with samson,
because hes strong... and his hair.
I gave you more responsibility
and you didnt do anything?
That you like.We did work... a lot.
I dont care if you work 10 seconds
if you bring me something I like.
Were going to do this right now.
Oh, I know you have plans.
You were going to call mefrom a bar with an idea?
Do you think elves do this?
Youre just gonna change it anyway.
Excuse me?!
- This is Mark Kerney.- I am so sorry.
I got drawn into his web.Its gonna be a while.
A while like soon,or a while like I should cancel?
15 minutes? It shouldnttake too long.
- Hes going to the boxing match.- Hes going to Maine?
You can watch it onclosed-circuit TV
in the movie theaters.We got tickets.
How come we didnt go?
Because were having a romanticdinner for my birthday.
Well, did you tell him that?
Look, Im the only one whocan help him with this
and the sooner I get off the phone,
the sooner I can come.
Just hurry, will you?
Shes gonna be a few minutes late.
A surprise on top of a surprise.
She works too hard.
"The oysters of Hercules,
which you with sword shall carve."
I saw a tray pass by.They look like hockey pucks.
$1.65. You shouldlet Gerry get this.
Mom, dont cut thekid off at the knees.
Now what if anelephant either sits on
or steps on the suitcase?
How about a slow-movingairplane runs it over?
Do you like Cassius Clay?
- Hes very handsome.- I dont think so.
Youre not supposed to.
I remember my mother talkingabout nat king Cole in a way
that made my father throwout all his records.
Hes got a big mouth.
"Im the greatest."" Not if you have to say it."
Muhammad Ali.
Do you like the airplane?
Liston just goesabout his business,
works methodically.
Clay will dance and talk,
throw a few until hes wiped out.
A bag under an airplane looks like
theres been an accident.
Three classes of suitcase...
featherweight, middleweight,heavyweight...
for whatever class youre in.
But how do you do that on TV?
- Whats the story?- You dont like it?
No, I love it. Thats great.Thats what we should do.
Let it ring.
Ill say youre not here.
Hello? Oh hello, Roger.
No, hes not here.
I answer other peoplesphones all the time.
Im going to count to three,then Im gonna start saying
a lot of words you dont like,sweetheart.
- This should be good.- Im begging you...
Get down here right away.
You think Id rather be working?
Yeah, I do. Did you know
Freddy Rumsen collectsIndian arrowheads?
Where are you?
Theres a bar next to Keenes.
Ive been sneaking offto fortify myself.
Tell em youre sick. Go home.
I am sick. I think I overdid it.
And theyre self-so-righteous.
I never pissed my pants.
This guy Rutledge k*lla man with a motorboat.
You know what gets youover something like that?
Drinking.
Still got your ticket.
Its an attractive offer.
Look out your window.Can you see me?
Good night, sweetheart.
Go ahead. Ill wait.
- Hello.- 15 minutes? Its almost an hour.
Im so sorry.Im gonna leave any minute.
Did you at least have something?
You have to get down here.
You have to get downhere right away.
I cant just leave, okay?
But you have to, okay?
You know what? Just go to myapartment and wait for me.
We can eat there another time.
No, I dont want to do that.
- Ill make it worth your while.- Damn it, Peggy.
Ive got your whole family here
for a surprise dinner, okay?
And the only way youcan make it worse
is by not coming at all.
Oh, Mark.
Im so sorry. Im coming right now.
Thank you.
Well, so much for the surprise.
Okay, Im going to leave ifthats all right with you.
Im not so sure about it.
I mean every time we get into this,
we abandon the toughness idea.
Maybe theres somethingto the elephant.
Do you want one?
Im sorry. Do youhave someplace to be?
Maybe tap your footso I get the message.
I was supposed to beat dinner an hour ago.
Its my birthday,and Im pretty sure
I ruined everything.
- Why the hell didnt you tell me?- I dont know.
Because I thought thiswould take a second.
So now Im supposedto feel like crap?
Oh, Im so sick that Iruined her birthday.
Do you know when my birthday is?
- I was your secretary!- Well, enjoy your evening!
By the way, you are20-something years old.
Its time to get over birthdays.
Go ahead. Ill do it myself.
Yes, Im that important.
So the fact thatyoure calling means
that you havent left yet.
Im not gonna be ableto make it at all.
- Are you kidding me?- Im sorry,
but no one asked you to do this.
You said you never had a surprise.
I cant believe you.
This is your mother speaking.
Hello, ma.
I just want you to knowthat were all here...
Me, Anita, Gerry, the roommate...
and were not leavinguntil you march in here.
I cant, okay? Could youput Mark on the phone?
Hes crestfallen, you know?
- Mrs. Olson, its okay.- Its not okay.
Now hes making excuses for you.
I dont know how many nice boys
you think are lining up for you.
You should be grateful.Okay, goodbye.
- Hello?- Im sorry I ruined this
and Im sorry you hadto spend the evening
with my mother.
You know what? Shes right.
Really? Then whydont you date her?
Shes never even had a job.
How the hell are you mad at me?
Because you used mybirthday to get in good
with a bunch of peoplewho drive me crazy.
Should I have invited don?You never stand him up.
Whats the point of doinganything nice for you?
Jesus. You even soundlike my mother.
Im already intothis place for $40.
If you dont mind,Im going to enjoy my dinner
and you enjoy your work.
The fact that youwould stay there...
you know what?
- Forget it.- No. What?
You want to do this right now?
- Do what?- Fine.
Its been nice knowing you.Happy Birthday.
- So thats it?- Yup. Good night.
Hello?
Itll be fine.
Couples fight. Ask Gerry.
Whats wrong? Elevator out?
I think I just broke up with Mark.
Oh. Really?...
I think so.
So go home.
Nope. Im ready to work.
You win. Again.
You couldve just toldme it was your birthday.
Right, and theredbe no repercussions.
- So now this is my fault?- Well, its not my fault
you dont have a family,friends or anywhere else to go.
Go. Go. Run to himlike in the movies.
- You dont have to be here.- I do have to be here
because of somestupid idea from Danny
who you had to hirebecause you stole
his other stupid ideabecause you were drunk.
Dont get personal becauseyou didnt do your work.
And by the way,I know it k*ll you,
but guess what:There is no "Dannys idea."
Everything that comes inhere belongs to the agency.
You mean you.
- As long as you still work here.- Is that a threat?
Because Ive alreadytaken somebody up
on one of those tonight.
- Relax.- You know what?
Heres a blank piece of paper.
Why dont you turnthat into glo-coat?
Are you out of your mind?
You gave me 20 ideas
and I picked out one of them
that was a kernel thatbecame that commercial.
- So you remember.- I do.
It was something about a cowboy.Congratulations.
No, it was something abouta kid locked in a closet
because his motherwas making him wait
for the floor to dry,
which is basicallythe whole commercial.
- Its a kernel.- Which you changed just enough
- so that it was yours.- I changed it into a commercial.
What, are we going to sh**t him
in the dark in the closet?
Thats the way it works.
There are no creditson commercials.
- But you got the clio!- Its your job!
I give you money,you give me ideas.
And you never say thank you.
Thats what the money is for!
Youre young. You willget your recognition.
And honestly,it is absolutely ridiculous
to be two years into yourcareer and counting your ideas.
Everything to youis an opportunity.
And you should bethanking me every morning
when you wake up,
along with Jesus,for giving you another day!
Oh, come on.
Im sorry about yourboyfriend, okay?
May 25th. Ideas for samsonite.
Toughness means that......
Peggy, get in here.
- No.- Come on.


You have to come in here right now.
What do you want?
You have to hear this. Sit down.
Come on. Sit.
So this is tape #4
of "Sterlings gold," by Roger Sterling.
So where was I?
Burt Cooper hated meand I thought it was
because he thought Idbe an ally of my father,
but it turned out itwas something to do
with my joie de vivre,
My romantic prowess...
See tape #3...
Including some time withthe queen of perversions,
his secretary Ida Blankenship.
You know what? Dont use her name.
But it was all about himhating my very youth,
all because the poorguy had been cut down
in the height of his sexual prime
by an unnecessary orchiectomy.
Lyle Evans, M.D.
I think he had him k*ll.
Anyway, sometime inthe summer of 48...
No, 1932...
No, 1939.
Why are you laughing?
Its like reading someones diary.
Come on. Ida was a hellcat?
Cooper lost his balls?
Rogers writing a book?
I should go.
- Stay and visit.- Ive got nothing to say.
- Sure you do.- No, its personal.
We have personal conversations.
No, we dont, and I thinkyou like it that way.
I know I do.
Suit yourself.
Were supposed to bestaring at each other
over candlelight andhe invites my mother?
He doesnt know me.
Its not my fault.
I guess Im back to square one.
Single.
Well, as Danny would say,
theres no use cryingover fish in the sea.
Mouse!
Over there!
- What are you doing?- Get the suitcase.
- Why?- Im gonna seal it up in my nice samsonite
- and throw it off the roof.- Dont.
Come on. Every idea you haveis some version of that.
Lets do it.Whered you go, Mickey?
- I think its a rat.- Its a mouse.
I grew up on a farm.
You know what?
Theres a way out of thisroom we dont know about.
Are you okay?
I think thats yours.
Its probably Mark.I dont want to answer it.
Its still your birthday.
Let me get you dinner.
Whats the most excitingthing about a suitcase?
Going somewhere.
The acropolis.
Id like to go to Greece.
I heard all the goodcooks stayed there.
Id like to just go on a plane.Ive never been.
- Is that right?- Ive heard about it, obviously.
Ive seen it in the movies.
Its an incredible idea... flying.
I remember on the way to Korea
they told us how many thousandfeet in the air we were.
There was some other kid there...
more of a yokel than me, even...
and he screamed,"man wasnt meant to fly!"
Cooper has no testicles?
Ick. I dont want water.
My uncle Max said he had a suitcase
that was always packed.
He said, "a man has to beready to go at any moment."
Jesus. Maybe its a metaphor.
Theres something to that idea.
I dont know.
I cant tell the difference anymore
between something thats goodand something thats awful.
Well, theyre very close.
But the best idea always wins
and youll know it when you see it.
Keep banging yourhead against the wall
then it happens.
And then its done.
Yes, maam.
Not like everythingelse in my life.
I mean, I know whatIm supposed to want,
but it just never feels right...
Or as important asanything in that office.
- I didnt know you were in Korea.- Very briefly.
Did you sh**t anybody?
Nope. I saw some people get k*ll.
Thats memorable.
My father died rightin front of me...
Heart attack. I was 12.
- Im sorry to hear that.- It was pretty violent.
The TV was on.
Thats why I hate sports.
Nobody was around...
Saturday afternoon.My mother was shopping.
I saw my father die too.
He was kicked by a horse....
Youre kidding.
- What about your mother?- I never knew her.
Why is there a dogin the Parthenon?
That is a roach.Lets go someplace darker.
I hate dating. Im terrible at it.
Youll find someone.
You know youre cute as hell.
Men dont exactly stopand stare in the streets.
Do you want that?
Thats not what youwere supposed to say.
What do you care what I think?
Well, everybody thinksI slept with you
to get the job.
They joke about it,
like its so funny
because the possibilitywas so remote.
Its not because youarent attractive.
I have to keep rules about work.
I have to.
Youre an attractive girl, Peggy.
Not as attractive as someof your other secretaries,
I guess.
You dont want to startgiving me morality lessons,
do you?
People do things, right?
My mother thinks youwere responsible,
because you were the only person
who visited me in the hospital.
Jesus. Really?
She hates you.
Do you know who it was?
Of course I do.
Do you ever think about it?
I try not to...
But then it comesup out of nowhere.
Playgrounds.
Get up!
Get up!
- Come on! Get up!- Get up!
- Come on, get up!- Get up.
- Come on.- Come on, get up!
Get up! Get up!
- Come on, get up!- Come on, get up!
Get up! Get up, bum!
- Come on.- Its a fix.
- The fix is in.- What happened?
- Its over.- Already? Who won?
- Clay.- Dont believe that for a second.
No one goes down like that.
Thats what the man just said.
Some fight. I lost 100 bucksin two minutes.
Lets go back, pack up and go home.
Damn elevators like a rocket.
I think Im gonna be sick.
Are you okay?
Do you want any water?
What?
I have toothpaste and atoothbrush in my desk.
Peggy?...
- Peggy.- Ill be right back.
Peggy?
Duck?
What are you doing?
Leaving Draper a little present.
Dont! Thats disgusting.
Would you let me concentrate?
This is Rogers office.
Now come one. Pull up your pants.
Im not going anywhere
without you.
Baby. Baby, I need you so bad.
You wouldnt answer your phone
and your roommate saidyou were still at work.
Why didnt you answerthe phone, Peewee?
Whats going on?
Just go lay down.
You dont belong in here.
So, Peggy, I see youre not alone.
I guess when screwing mecouldnt get you anything,
you had to go back to Draper.
- Duck, lets go.- No.
Thats right. We were in love.
Turns out shes just another whore.
Hey!
Jesus! Would you stop?!
Stop it! Youre both drunk!
You know, I k*ll17 men at Okinawa.
Uncle.
What the hell is wrong with you?
You still thinkyoure better than me?
Come on, Peggy. Lets go.
I got rid of him. Are you okay?
Yeah.
Are you?
I, uh... I never thought...
Im so sorry. I...
you know what? I dontknow why I was with him.
- It was a confusing time.- Stop.
You dont have to explain.
Can you get me a drink?
How long are you gonnago on like this?
I have to make a phone call
and I know its goingto be bad, okay?
Oh.
Do you want to be alone?
Just make me a drink.
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
- Hello.- Its me.
Shes gone.
I know.
She wanted you to know.
Im sorry I didnt call. I was...
did she want to talk to me?
You know, she wasnt really there.
Im coming out.
Ill make the arrangements.
No need. She lefther body to science.
She said that she wanted to go
to U.C.L.A. Medicalschool tuition-free.
Of course she did.
Im coming out.Ill take care of the house.
Id like to stay hereif thats okay with you,
take some time off from school.
Of course. Thats fine.
Shes in a better place.
Thats what they say.
Its late and its been a long day.
Okay.
- Goodbye.- Goodbye.
Stephanie.
What happened?
Somebody very important to me died.
Who?
The only person in theworld who really knew me.
Thats not true.
You should go home.
You can come in late.
Ill be fine.
Im so sorry.
Good night.
Drop and give me 20.
You assh*le.
Get to work. Its 10:30, maggot.
- Oh.- Did you spend the night here?
- Yeah.- See the fight?
No.
90 seconds of boxing andthree hours of analysis.
- And we still dont know who won.- Clay won.
Read the paper.
Come in.
You look fresh. Did you go home?
I spruced up. Come over here.
Look at this.
I think you have to know the photo.
Its on the front page ofevery paper. Its historic.
How do we know its thetourister that got knocked out?
Because the slogan will say so.
How do you put it on TV?Are they animated?
Why are you sh1tting on this?
Im tired.
Its good.
Its very good.
Give it to Joey... No, Stan...
Then go home, shower,
then come back andgive me 10 tag lines.
Okay.
Open or closed?
Open.
