Paris and ty power.
How did Imarry rick?
- He has no eyelashes.- ( laughing )
So...
I have to ask.Do you ever see don?

( door opens, closes )
You think youre gonnathrow me out of myown company?
Madeline,Ive got it.
Todd, could youexcuse us?
Don has a habitof walking into meetings
Unannounced.
- Should I reschedule?- Get out!
It was cut and dry.You broke the stipulations
Of the addendumto your contract.
You set thatmeeting to force meout of the agency.
What was Isupposed to do?
You know,ted and I,
Whenever we wouldhear that your agencywas involved,
Wed always beso intimidated.
"what was that manup to?"
Such a cloudof mystery.
Now that Ive beenbackstage?
Im deeplyunimpressed, don.
Youre just a bullyand a drunk.
A football playerin a suit.
The most eloquentIve ever heard you

The contractwas very clear.
You wanna playparliamentary procedure?Lets play.
Everyone who wantsto get rid of me,raise your hand.
Fine.I have teds proxy.

Anyone else?
All opposed?
Motion denied.
That is a very sensitivepiece of horseflesh.

Whoever is in controlis in charge.
Were in control!Weve got the votes--
Except forbenedict joan.
Don cost her amillion dollars whenwe didnt go public.
So you want himout, too?
Do you understanddon draper canwork anywhere?
No man has evercome back from leave.Even napoleon.
He staged a coup,but he ended upback on that island.
So why didnt youvote him out?
Because Im a leaderand a leader is loyalto his team.
Don doesntunderstand that.
But I do.
And you havetalent and k*lland experience.
- But yourenot a leader.- And cutler is?
He has a vision,but hes not on my team.
So, "lets have anothercup of coffee, lets haveanother piece of pie"?
( door bangs )
Pilot on p.A.:Ladies and gentlemen,wed like to ask you now
To extinguishyour cigarettes as weprepare for takeoff.
Id like to saythat well be sharingthe sky today
With one othernotable aircraft,
And Id like to wishfellow pilots
Neil armstrong,buzz aldrin and mike collins
Godspeedand a safe return.
Why did you have to do that?Now I feel like werein danger.
If they dont make it,were going to have to
Postpone this thingfor a year.
Youre going to go in thereand youre going to win this.
And if cutler doesntlike it, Im sorry,
But the don drapershow is back
From its unscheduledinterruption.
I appreciate that,but Im not rattled.
Well, youresighing a lot.

Armstrong:It takes a pretty goodlittle jump.
Walter cronkite:So theres a footon the moon.
Stepping downon the moon.
If hes testingthat first step,
He must be stepping downon the moon at this point.
Mission control:Buzz, this is houston.
F2-1/160 secondfor shadow photographyon the sequence camera.
Buzz aldrin:Okay.
Armstrong:Im at the footof the ladder.
The lem footpads are only
Depressed in the surfaceabout one or two inches,
Although the surfaceappears to be
Very, very fine grainedas you get close to it.
Its almostlike a powder...
Down there.
Its very fine.
Cronkite:Boy, look at those pictures.Wow.
- Its a little shadowy, but--- ( cheers, banging on wall )
Hot damn.
Cronkite:Armstrong is on the moon.Neil armstrong.
38-year-old american,standing on the surfaceof the moon.
On this July 20th, 1969.
Armstrong:Thats one small stepfor man...
One giant leapfor mankind.
Bravo.
Wally schirra:I think that was neils quote,I didnt understand.
Cronkite:Well, "one small stepfor man,"
But I didnt getthe second phrase.
Mission control:Roger. We got you boresighted
But back under one track.
Its justincredible.
Ill tell youwhats incredible.
It cost 25billion dollars.
Be quiet, sean.

Okay.
- ( ringing continues )- armstrong: ...Underneathit says,
"here manfrom the planet earth..."
- Francis residence.- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, daddy.- Isnt this something?

And startcalling them.
Its 1:00in the morning.
The agency and the worldare closed tomorrow.
Do we haveto do this now?
Well, astragic as this is,I for one am happy
That we have a chanceto have a conversationwith the clients
About the futureof this company.
- ( sighs )- and to give don drapera send-off along with bert.
Excuse me?
I hate to remind youthat with harryspartnership
And without bert,dons dismissal isa foregone conclusion.
Coopers beendead an hour
And youre pryinhis hand open?
Roger, I knowwhat this companyshould look like.
Computer services.Media buys pinpointedwith surgical accuracy.
We can offer the servicesbeyond our clients.
Its the agencyof the future.
Is this what wouldhappen if I died?
( sighs )
( crickets chirping )
Are you the only oneout here?
Yes.Is that okay?
Yeah, I dont wantthem giving me shitfor smoking.
Smokingcauses cancer.
How does it look?Can you see it?
The moon?Nah, its already set.
Then why arent youwatching tv?
I dont wannalisten to themor the reporters.
Besides, theres otherthings to look at.
Like what?

Well, now Imgonna lose you, too.
We dont havethe votes anymore.

( sighs )well, hes consistent.
Poor bert.

Every timean old man startstalking about napoleon,
You knowtheyre gonna die.

He was hard on me,you know?
But maybehe was right.
The last thing I said to himwere the lines to someold song.

( sighs )
( sighs )
Aldrin:Okay. The hatch is closedand latched...

Theres beena change of plans.

What? No.
We have a couple hours.You can practice it withme and still be fresh.
- Are you serious?- Youre gonna be great.
No. Stopmessing around.
Its not funny.
( tv off )
( sighs )
You must have heardthat theyre tryingto get me out.
If I winthis business,and then I go,
Youll be leftwith nothing.
Theyre tryingto get you out?
I thought everythingwas finally backto normal.
Me, too, but...
Sometimes actionshave consequences
And one ofthem is I cantpresent tomorrow.
You win this businessand it will be yours.
No, don.
Its tomorrow.Im unprepared.
Youve been listeningto me for weeks.
Well, I cant just saywhat youve been saying.
Im a woman.Im the "voiceof moms," remember?
Maybethats better.
Maybe thatsthe way it alwaysshould have been.
Well, petewont stand for it.
Petes pregnant.He has to do what we say.
No. Cancel it.What about the moon landing?
- It was a success.- No, don.
I have to talkto people who justtouched the face of god
About hamburgers!
I wouldnt do thisif I didnt knowyou could.
Youve never evenseen me present.
Ive overheard things.
We have no liquor.
Good morning.
Did you see welanded on the moon?
( chuckles )is that right?
Neil armstrong, whatare you going to do withthe rest of your life?
Screw every girlin florida, I guess.
So you called meat sunrise to discussthe meaning of life?
No. I just want to knowif buick had left you yet.
Why would theydo that?
Because weve builta relationship with gm
And they know we canhandle a bigger car.
And our chevy accountman just moved there.
Uncle.
So, you madethe overture.
What did youhave in mind?
Well...
Wed want the wholechevy team.
You, jim cutler,don draper,
And ted chaough.
We both know youre inthe acquisitions business.
I think...You should buythe whole company.
Because I havea vision.
All our accounts,our cutting-edgecomputer,
And the employees thatI know to be worthy
As an independentsubsidiary of mccann.
You just lostburger chef,we may win it.
Then youd stillhave it.
And Id havemy company--
Without jim cutlerand all that baggagefrom cgc.
Thats aninteresting idea.
But this is stillall about buick.
You have to burythe hatchet withted chaough.
- Why?- Because gmthinks he
And don draperare one person.
I dont knowif I can do that.
Well, then, I dont knowif I can help you.
( low whirring )
( coughs )
( faint voicesoverlapping )
( whirring continues )
( laughing )
- ( whirring stops )- Im gonna be bold and say
That no onein this room
Knows more aboutthe burger chefcustomer
Than peggy olson.
Shes visited20 restaurantsin nine states,
Interviewed hundredsand is obviously
Uniquely qualifiedto craft thismodern campaign.
Every great adtells a story.
Here to tell that storyis peggy olson.
Thank you, don.
Thats a lotto live up to.
Because I certainlycant tell a better story
Than the onewe saw last night.
I dont know what wasmore miraculous--
The technologicalachievement
That put our speciesin a new perspective
Or the fact that all of uswere doing the same thingat the same time.
Sitting in this room,
We can stillfeel the pleasureof that connection.
Because, I realize now,we were starved for it.
We really were.
And, yes, well feel itagain when they allreturn safely.
And, yes, the worldwill never be the samein some ways.
But tonight, Im goingto go back to new york,
And Ill go backto my apartment
And finda 10-year-old boy
Parked in frontof my tv, eating dinner.
Now, I dont needto charge you fora research report
That tells you thatmost television sets
Are not more thansix feet away fromthe dinner table.
And that dinner table
Is your battlefieldand your prize.
This is the homeyour customersreally live in.
This is yourdinner table.
Dad likes sinatra,son likes the rolling stones.
The tvs always on,vietnam playing inthe background.
The news winsevery night.
And youre starving.
And not justfor dinner.
What if therewas another table,
Where everybodygets what they wantwhen they want it?
Its bright and clean,
And theres no laundry,
No telephone,and no tv.
And we can havethe connection
That were hungry for.
There may be chaosat home,
But theres family supperat burger chef.
Thats beautiful.
Thats nice to hear
Because thatsthe name of the spot.
( chuckling )
We open on a birds-eye viewof a typical kitchen table.
( elevator bell pings )
- Welcome home.- Howd you getin here?
Money.But he wouldntopen the door.
I needto talk to ya.
Cooperstill dead?
His situationhasnt changed,but ours has.
Can Iget a drink?
- Roger: Howd it go?- Great.
That why youre here?
We got an offerfrom mccann ericksonto buy the agency.
Hear me out.Wed be a subsidiary,separately operated.
We keep our name,our offices,you keep your job--
Your real job--and Ill bethe president.
- Of mccann?- No, of sterling cooper.
They know were primedfor a big car,
And they dont wantto compete with us.
Did you forgetwe started this agencyto get away from them?
Yeah, I know that.But a lots happenedin between.
Most of it good,but some of it very bad.
Without cooper, cutlersgonna lock you outby the end of the week.
- I dont wantto work for mccann.- Youre gonna work for me.
Dont fool yourself.You know theyre notgonna leave us alone.
They did with marschalk.And theyre buying 51%.Youre gonna make a fortune.
Fine, you have my vote.Whats that gonna do?
You cant evensave my job, how are yougonna sell the company?
Im working on it.Youre of essenceto the deal.
But so isted chaough.
Ted chaough?What are you doing?
They want the guyswho won chevy.
Roger, I just wannado my work. I dont wannadeal with business anymore.
And whatabout everyone else?We all send out resumes?
Cutlers not gonna stopuntil the firm is justharry and the computer.
That meanseverybody goes.
And you know it.
( door closes )
- ( raps )- ted, welcome back.
Well, Im sorryits under thesecircumstances.
Ive instructed donto gather everyoneat noon.
Did you want todiscuss the remarks?
I thought we would beginwith a poem of memorialfor bert.
"o captain,my captain"?
Then we have a lotof pressing business here
With finalizing donsdeparture and--
And I havean announcementof my own.
We dont needto deal with that today.
I havent heardanything.
- About what?- Burger chef.
- Good morning.- Im glad thatyoure here.
Would you pleaseall have a seat?
Theres coffee.I have some ratherurgent business.
I insist.
Im coming to all of youwith an incredible opportunity.
Mccann erickson wantsto buy a 51% stake in sc&p.
Well beindependentlyoperated,
And all they ask arefive-year contracts
From everyone.
- Including don?- Especially don.
And youll beour king.
Well, I didput it together.
The details haveto be worked out,
But well keep our office,our name, and our clients.
- Why would they do that?- Because we finallyturned this place
Into a legitimate threatand theyd like to neutralize itwith cold, hard cash.
- How much?- When did youdo this?
Since you asked, Illuse you as an example.
Lets say they valuethe agency at $65 million
And they buy51% of it.
That means your 5%shares worth a littleover $1.5 million.
- 25% of that upon signing.- Oh, my goodness.
Ive got 10%!
Keep countingthose chickens.
I hope you all realizethis is a patheticploy and a delusion.
It is until everybodyvotes on it.
Sorry, just heardabout the partners meeting.
- Perfect timing.- He hasnt signed.He missed the boat.
- Whats going on?- None of your beeswax.
- Ill take the deal.- Goodbye, harry.
Dont worry about it.
- Well, I wont do it.- Thats fine becauseyoure not of essence.
- And you are?- Yes, all they care aboutis me, don, and ted.
Don, youre gonna signa contract to work atmccann for five years?
- Well, Ive given thisa lot of thought.- Im sure you did.
And I agree with rogerthat we should doeverything we can
To keep jim frombreaking up the agency.
You mean,save your hide.
Look, I dont wantto stand in the way
Of everyone makingall this money,
But I am donewith advertising.
Your 20% share willbe worth at least$6 million.
Im going to haveplenty of money
From sellingmy partnershipas it stands.
Cant you do itwithout me?
You dont thinkI tried that?
If I sign a contractfor five years,
Thatll bethe rest of my life.
- Youve got to be kidding me.- Youre not just pathetic,youre selfish.
Well, Im sorry,roger.
You may have the votes,but you dont have a deal.
Now can we dispensewith this nonsense,
Go outside and saya fond farewell?
Ted.
What if I told youthat you could justwrite copy
And fight clientsand not worry about
Partnership votesor stock prices?
You could justgo back to creative.
I have that right now,and Im miserable.
No, you dont.
I really lost thislast year
And I realizedI would do anythingto get back in.
And I did anything.
I wrote tags,I wrote coupons.
Things I havent donesince I first got my start.
I know you.I know the man whoI walked into chevy with.
You dont haveto work for us,
But you have to work.
You dont wannasee what happenswhen its really gone.
You rememberthe last time he talkedyou into something?
I dont know.
- So, Id move back to the city?- Teds in. Lets have a vote.
- Hold on.- Lets have a vote.
Everyone in favor.
( sighs )
Really?
Its a lotof money.
( voices overlapping )
I just got off the phonewith burger chef.
They couldnt findanyone.
We got it.
Well, they heardwhat I heard.
Where are you going?
