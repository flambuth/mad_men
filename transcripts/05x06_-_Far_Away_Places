Did you eat my pack of violet candy?
What?
Its purple and silver.
Don gave it to mebefore a presentation once.
- No.- I need it.
- So youll buy another one.- Thats not the same.
Dont be such a strict Catholic.
Ill buy one for you and Ill say a brucha.
How about tonightwe go see that stupid movie
about the guy being hunted in Africa?
- The Naked Prey.- I dont know, Abe.
Youre gonna resist the chanceto see Cornel Wilde naked?
I heard he wrestles a boa constrictor.Sounds pretty dirty.
I cant think beyond my presentation.
Theres always special circumstances.
Thats not true.
Ive been working on Heinz for months.
You know what you want?You want to take me to work with you,
and stick me in a drawerand open it whenever you get bored.
Fine. You dont want tosee each other anymore?
Jesus!
You always wantto push the button on the whole thing.
I come all the way up here to make love.
Half the time, you dont want toand then you just do it to get it over with.
Its just hard when I come right from work.
I need a second when I walk in the door.
- You sound like my dad.- Fine.
Well go to the movies. I just cant promisethat my mind wont be elsewhere.
Your mind is always elsewhere.
Why are you doing this right now?
Most men wouldnt evenhave this conversation. Theyd just leave.
And why would they do that?
Im your boyfriend, not a focus group.
Have a shitty day.
I dont know. Cant you make it till Friday?
Because today is not a good day.
This conversation went in a circleand were back where we started.
The answer is no.
Yeah, me, too.
I just had the same conversation.
No, I think they were differentbecause yours was private.
Sorry Im late.
Theres no place to pee in this city.
- She just got here.- Then why are you giving me a hard time?
We had the funniest thingoutside our building.
A bunch of students with backpacksasked us how to get to Broadway.
Whats so funny about that, Jethro?
Its like the campaign.We could have cast it right there and then.
- Megan, can I have a moment?- Sure.
- She goes to casting now?- I guess so.
Shes kind of been my junior on this.
I was buying dinnerlast night for this large-breasted girl
who calls herself Salome,and shes looking at the menu,
ridiculing this Grandma Moses drawingand shes balls-out funny.
But I ignore her because all I can think of
is Ill never be able to drawas well as a photograph.
Oh, thank God.
I couldnt take one more omen of doom.
Im sorry.Were gonna have to miss the presentation.
We have to head upstatefor Howard Johnsons.
- Really?- Youre running the show.
How does me sitting there change anything?
Howard Johnsons, huh?
I love the colors, the atmosphere,
- the clams.- Shes never been to one.
Im really sorry.
No, we have all your work, I guess.
Ill check in from the road. Get your stuff.
Break a leg.
- Well, thats a disaster.- Dont listen to him.
Thats a vote of confidence.
Give me one of those.
The fire is primal.
These kids, they all come there alone,
and gathered in a circle,they suddenly feel included.
Theyre safe from whatever is out therein the night, in the darkness.
Its the beans that brought them togetheron that cool night at the end of the summer.
I wish someone was eating beans.
That guy is.
I did ask for college students.
I know that, Raymond.
And we want you to haveeverything you asked for.
Well, stop writing down what I asked forand try to figure out what I want.
Raymond, I saw you when she was talking.
- You were off somewhere.- Its very sentimental.
I have that memory.
Thats for me. Thats not for kids.
Kids have memories.
And so do the homemakerswho make a home with Heinz.
Raymond, can you seehow passionate she is?
Photography will really capture the funon their faces. And the glow.
Did Don sign off on this?
Don loves this work.
Maybe Don doesnt understandwhat you wanted either.
Lets not speak for Don.
Im sorry.Im not a word person like you people.
Sure, you are.
And your words are always,"I dont like it."
And I think youre right.We dont understand you.
Because you do like it.
I think you just like fighting.
Peggy, youre being oversensitive.
Do you know how often people come in hereand look at work and feel something?
Almost never.
You have to run with this.
Its young and its beautiful.
And no one else is gonna figure outhow to say that about beans.
Can you believe this girl?
I dont know. Can you?
Miss, youre lucky that I have a daughteror I wouldnt be so understanding.
Raymond, theyre frustrated,but theyre not through.
Im frustrated, too.
- Its close, I guess.- Its damn close.
Why dont just you and Ihave dinner tonight?
Maybe take in a show?Take your mind off things?
You can try.
Ive got to admire you.
That was a completely suicidal move.
Women usually want to please.
Give me sketches of the talking beans.
Ill write new dialog.
- Youre off the business.- Whatd he say?
He said youre off the business.
Everyone has somewhere to go today.
Im going to the movies.
Very good.
One of them gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?
Well, neither are you when youre hungry.
I dont suppose youve fed them.
No, I cant say I have.
You didnt pack any lions milkfor me before I left.
You didnt ask me.
Youre going to get in trouble.
Want some?
Sure. What the hell.
Come on.
- Hello.- Hi.
But why dont they?
Its at least two days since theyve eaten.
- Theyll just die.- Yes, I know.
It must be the formula.We havent hit on it yet.
Well just have to try again.
Right, back to the drawing board.
- Formula...- Thirteen.
Oh, George, Ive just been thinkingabout the cod-liver oil.
Shes not gonna make it out thereon her own.
Youve got to keep it down.
Okay.
Arent you worried?
Itll turn out all right.
That evening, we sufferedall the agony of parents
whose teenage daughteris out on her first date.
No.
Just watch the movie.
We returned the next day only to find Elsa
minus both the young lion and her food.
I told you a dozen sometimesI was coming in.
And I said no, youre not coming in.
Cause you dont want I should see you?
You see me at home, for Christs sake.
You stare at me when Im sleeping.
I dont want to see you anyway.
- I just want to use the photocopy.- For what?
Im building my case.
Again?
Whos this?
Im Peggy Olson. I work with Ginsberg.
Well, Im the original.
Okay. Its bedtime.
Miss Olson.
- What time is it?- Its 8:30.
Mr. Drapers on the phone.
Ill take it in here. You can go.
Good night.
- Hello?- Dawn didnt get any calls.
Did you get any calls?
- About what?- Has anyone called you?
I dont think so.
Okay.
Listen, it didnt go well.
- Ive got to go.- I take full responsibility.
Hello?
Why didnt you tell me you had a family?
- Your fathers nice.- Hes not my real father.
People dont understand.
- Are you adopted?- Actually, Im from Mars.
Its fine if you dont believe me,but thats where Im from.
Im a full-blooded Martian.
Dont worry.Theres no plot to take over Earth.
Were just displaced.
Okay.
I can tell you dont believe me.
Thats okay. Were a big secret.
They even tried to hide it from me.
That man, my father,
told me a storyI was born in a concentration camp,
but, you know, thats impossible.
And I never met my motherbecause she supposedly died there.
Thats convenient.
Next thing I know, Morris therefinds me in a Swedish orphanage.
I was five. I remember it.
Thats incredible.
Yeah.
And then I got this one communication.
A simple order.
"Stay where you are."
Are there others like you?
I dont know.
I havent been able to find any.
- Hello?- Hi. Its me.
You at work?
No, Im home.
Come up here.
You need me, huh?
I always need you.
What happened?
This guy told methe strangest thing at work today.
Yeah?
He said he was bornin a concentration camp.
But thats impossible, right?
It happened.
- Come up here.- Okay.
Hurry.
Im going to go in thereand sit down with the door closed.
And I want you to buzz mewhen he comes in.
One buzz for Don,two buzzes for Mr. and Mrs.
- Who died?- Lets play hooky.
Should I close the door?
Remember when we used to representdouble-sided aluminum?
I remember twins and a hospital.
Not that part.
Bob Whozits moved overto Howard Johnsons
to help them with their new models.
So how about a completely debauchedand unnecessary fact-finding boondoggle
to the flagship in
Plattsburgh, New York?
Just an hour from scenic Lake Placid.
Are you kidding me?
Did you ever hear the oneabout the farmers daughter?
This is where it all takes place.
- No.- Don, come on.
Alone, Im an escapeefrom some expensive mental institution.
But the two of us,were a couple of rich, handsome perverts.
- I love Howard Johnsons.- Well try and stop by.
I think Montreal is an hour away.
Look, the whole point of goingis to forget about her.
I mean, Im supposed to have dinnerwith Janes snooty friends,
sit around talking about Frank Lloyd Rice.
I always say it that way. They hate it.
You know what?
- Im gonna take Megan.- Really?
You can bring Jane.
Megan gets along with everyone.
Youre very funny. Forget it.
Newlyweds.
Ill give Dawn the guys name.
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everythingthrough the weekend.
It was a dumb idea.
- Megan, can I have a moment?- Sure.
- Youre not gonna say anything?- What?
I said you look nice,and I said I dont want to do this.
Well, what do you want to do?
Go home, open your vest and yell at the TVfor the next 20 years? Go ahead.
God! Okay, Im sorry.I dont know these people.
I do.
And its not about them.
Its very important to me.I dont know how many ways to say it.
I should have wornsomething more comfortable.
You really do look great.
Its the study of the waysthat things are true or false.
Some things are possibly true.Some are necessarily true.
Some used to be true. Some will be true.
Some are true on this planet,but not necessarily others.
So theres no good and badbecause the truth is relative?
Even if the truth iswhat you would call relative,
good and bad are not relative.
Your mistake is that youre assuming
that because something is true,that its good.
Professors got you there.
I think the truth is goodbecause its always real
on any planet.
I have patients who spend yearsreasoning out their motivation for a mistake.
And when they find it out,they think theyve found the truth.
They probably have.
And then they goand make the same mistake.
Like who?
Catherine has been the psychiatristto some celebrities.
So they never get better?
I didnt say that.I just said that its a myth
that tracing logicall the way down to the truth
is a cure for neurosis or for anything else.
Is there a cure for neurosis?
Love works.
I say we postpone this conversationuntil after we turn on.
- Shall we?- Or after we turn in.
Jane, honey, you ready?
What do you think youre doing?
I took your college course.I say its time to hit the sack.
- No, were gonna do this.- Do what?
I told you,were going to take L.S.D. with them.
You were supposed to clear your schedule.
L.S.D.? Really?
You really are never listening, are you?
- How long does it last?- Please.
I dont want to do this alone.
Itll be good for us.
Okay.
Just copy what theyre doing.
I think we are going to go.
- No.- We had a lovely time.
No one has to stay.
AII Ill say isthat I have taken it now four times
and every experiencewas more beautiful than the last.
And Im not gonna take it.Ill be here to guide you.
Im excited.
Im not gonna lie, Im a little nervous.
This is an experienceof self-fulfilling prophecy.
You have to enter into itwith a spirit of optimism.
Its like a boat trip.You dont cast off thinking about sinking.
And this boat is perfect.And the water is calm.
No, you hold on to that.
Go ahead.
Just let it melt on your tongue.
You always say I never take you anywhere.
Well, Dr. Leary, I find your product boring.
Only awareness can make reality.
And only whats real can become a dream.
And only from a dreamcan you wake to the light.
Okey-dokey.
Hes not making this up.
Its from The Tibetan Book of the Damned.
The "dead," my dear.Bardo Thodol is a guide to dying.
Oh, my God!
Look at my arm.
I dont want to die.
Some party.
AII absence is deathif we let ourselves know it.
Werent you the one who saidwe were supposed to think positive?
Yes.
I feel like that when Roger goes to work.
A mere change is incremental and shallow.
Im sitting here listeningto these people have a conversation.
It has nothing to do with me.
Its incredible.
Dont look in the mirror.
What?
Dont look in the mirror.
- Why didnt you tell me that?- I did.
I already looked.
Look at me. Everythings okay.
You are okay.
Now go to your wife.
Why?
Because she wants to be alonein the truth with you.
Just go already.
Youre crying.
Its so...
Its perfect here.
Lets go home.
Why are you laughing?
Are you laughing at me?
Whats wrong with me?
Its the World Series.
1919. The Black Sox.
Were you there?
No, but Im there.
Look at the cars. Model T, Model T,Model A, Model T.
I cant see it.
What time is it?
How could a few numberscontain all of time?
I can feel your lips.
- Im still here.- I can see you.
- Youre beautiful.- You always say that.
Its all you ever say.
Now I know why your friends are so smart.
Catherine is not my friend. Shes my doctor.
I knew that, but I didnt know it.
Sometimes I thinkshe knows me better than you do.
Do I want to know?
Probably not.
Because its over?
Shes just waiting for me to say it.
And what does she think of me?
She thinks Im waiting for you to say it.
But instead, you wrote methis poem tonight, didnt you?
I knew we were going somewhere,and I didnt want it to be here.
Do you feel as relieved as I do?
AII I think about is having an affair.
I see them everywhere.
You never cheated on me?
There was a kiss.
I stopped it.
And then I was mad at you,
that you didnt appreciate it
even though you didnt know about it.
A younger man?
No, Roger.
Thats always been real.
And I wont even ask about you.
I just know for a factthat you did not fall in love.
So what was wrong again?
You dont like me.
I did.
I really did.
- Is it morning?- Yes.
Im sorry I always say it,but you are so beautiful.
Last night was beautiful.
It was, wasnt it?
Where are you going?
Out the door
and into the elevator, I suppose.
What about me?
You can take your time, obviously.
I figured Id just check into a hotelfor a while.
I dont want to displace you.
What are you talking about?
I imagined all the screamingand fighting and lawyers.
Its just so beautiful
how we were able to be there together
in the truth, like you wanted.
- Are you leaving me?- No.
Were leaving each otherjust like you said.
- I didnt say that.- You did.
You said so many amazing things.
- You were speaking German.- I dont know German.
You were quoting your father.
It must have been Yiddish.
But I was on drugs.I obviously didnt mean any of it.


So your psychiatrist didnt tell you
that you knew this was over,but you were waiting for me to say it?
I did say that.
Its good that you didbecause we both knew it.
No.
I dont know.
Its going to be very expensive.
I know.
Dawn, I need you to get me out of everythingthrough the weekend.
It was a dumb idea.
- Megan, can I have a moment?- Sure.
Listen, theres a Howard Johnsons upstate,they want us to visit immediately.
I thought wed goand make a long weekend of it.
- What about Heinz?- What about it?
Itll be fine. Remember California?
- Two hotel rooms.- Of course.
- But we can go tomorrow.- Come on.
Lets go right now. We can do this.
I dont know.
Im the boss. Im ordering you. Come on.
You know, its like an hour and a halffrom my parents.
Theyre coming to visit soon.
I know. Youre right.
And we dont have to work much tonight.
Someone named Daleis going to give us the royal treatment.
You like orange sherbet?
- I dont know.- Youve never had it?
- You are in for a treat.- Sounds great.
Everything okay?
Im just tired.
So take a nap. Relax.
When you wake up,you will feel like youre on vacation.
You know what? Tell me moreabout what were going to be doing
in Howard Johnsonsso I can get some sleep.
Could you open your window?
I wonder how Heinz went.Peggy seemed nervous.
Peggy knows what shes doing.
What are you worrying about that for?
I feel like I abandoned the team.
You feel bad because you gotto take off and they had to work?
I dont.
There has to be some advantageto being my wife.
Ill check in with Peggy later.
Okay.
They got an indoor pool.
Did you bring that suit from Acapulco?
I forgot. I was rushing.
Well get you a new one after we check in.I brought mine.
- Mr. Draper?- Its Don.
Pleased to meet you.This is my wife, Megan.
Dale Vanderwort.
A little more notice,I would have rolled out the orange carpet.
Ive got your room all set for you.
Actually, Id like something to eatand something to drink.
Sure, Im going to bring youa sampling of everything.
- Do you like clams?- I like everything.
I got you something.
I got one for Bobby,and I got a box of saltwater taffy for Sally.
What did you get for Gene?
Sally will shareand shell make Bobby share.
I was the youngest, Don.You cant forget about him.
Trust me, he wont know the difference.
Didnt make much of a dent.Anything to your liking?
- We had a little of everything.- Should I bring some desserts?
Yes, how about some pie?
No, you know what? Just three scoopsof orange sherbet and two spoons.
The colors are bright and cheerful.
The kids have candy.Full bar for Mom and Dad.
Would you say its a delightful destination?
Its not a destination.
Its on the way to someplace.
Thats true. Its a long car drive.
Mom probably needs to use the restroom.
Kids get a look at the place,
force them to stay.
You like to work, but I cant like to work?
You should have told meif it was so important to you.
- We didnt have to go.- I never got the chance.
It was in front of everyone.And its embarrassing.
I ruined the whole damn thingby pulling you off that crack team.
I am on the team.
- Here we go.- Shes never tried it.
- Youre kidding.- Try it.
Oh, no, sorry.
- Its not for everybody.- It tastes like perfume to me.
Thats why we make 28 flavors.
Can I get a scoop of chocolate?
Really?
I dont like it.
Theres no chanceyoure trying to embarrass me?
Youre right. Im sorry.
Its so delicious.
Its so good.
Stop it.
Whats wrong with you?
Im sorry.Maybe you could make up a little schedule
so Ill know when Im workingand when Im your wife.
It gets so confusing.
I know, Im terrible.Making you eat ice cream.
Why dont you call your mother
and hurl a string of complaints at herin French like you always do?
- Im always talking about you.- The woman speaks English.
Why dont you call your mother?
Don.
Do not walk away from me.
- Get in the car.- No, I am talking to you.
Okay, dont get in the car.
Go ahead.
You care more what sometruck stop waitress thinks than what I say.
"Get in the car. Eat ice cream.
"Leave work. Take off your dress."
Yes, Master.
Dont you dare pull away!Im talking to you.
Excuse me. Was my wife just in here?
- She was.- Whered she go?
- I dont know.- To the hotel?
She was talking to those fellas over there.
They all left.
They went towards the parking lot together.
I thought she was looking for you.
Youre really checking the place out.
Ive got your room key.
Do you want help with your bags?
No. Did you give my wife a key?
No. Do you want another key?
No. No.
I have some bad news.
- What?- We closed the pool.
Some kid had an accident.
I swear it doesnt happen a lot.
- You took care of me, sir.- No, can I get some dimes?
Dale will let you use the phone.
Thats okay. Pay phones fine.
Its none of my business,
but couples fight in here all the time.
Theres no reason to think the worst.
She probably got a ride homewith those kids.
- Hello?- Dawn didnt get any calls.
Did you get any calls?
- About what?- Has anyone called you?
I dont think so.
- Okay.- Listen, it didnt go well.
- Ive got to go.- I take full responsibility.
- Hello?- Marie.
Hello, its Don.
Hello. Is everything all right?
I just wanted to call
to say hello
and wanted to knowif Megan had called you.
Has Megan called me tonight? No.
No.
Don, are you still there?
Well, I wanted to buy her some jewelry,
and I remembered thatshe had an allergic reaction to metal,
but I dont remember if its silver or gold.
Twenty-four karat gold is fineand so is sterling silver.
Well, good.
What a fine husband you are.It is only gold alloy...
Listen, Marie, if she does call,
dont ruin the surprise, okay?
- Of course. Of course not.- Thank you.
Okay. Au revoir.
Nice talking to you, Don.
Are you okay?
Im sorry to do that to you, sir,
but they dont let patronssleep in the restaurant.
No, no, of course not.
What time is it?
Its 1:45.
Well, my wife, she...
Shes missing. She took off from here.
- When was this?- I dont know.
Almost seven hours ago.
Well, Ill be back and forthhere all morning.
Ill keep an eye out.
The Whitestone Bridgeto the Hutchinson River Parkway to 95.
You cold?
Its like Im in shock.
Where are we?
Where are we going?
To your new house.
I dont want to go there.
I dont want vacation to end.
Me either.
When can we go back?
If you go to sleep,when you wake up, Ill tell you.
I thought you hated that song.
You keep telling her to stop singing it.
And now its stuck in my head.
Megan.
- Megan!- Go away.
- Open the door.- No.
Open the damn door.
I dont want to see you.
Open the door or Im gonna kick it in.
Leave me alone!
- Get out.- I said I was sorry.
- I dont care.- Where the hell were you?
I stopped every 20 milesand called the apartment.
Why didnt you answer the g*dd*mn phone?
Because youre a pig! You left me there!
Where the hell were you?I thought you were dead.
Six and a half hours on a bus.
And then try getting a cabat Port Authority at 5:00 in the morning.
Try getting anything but an offer.
I thought you were dead.
How could you do that to me?
I dont know.
It was a fight.
Its over.
No.
Every time we fight,it just diminishes us a little bit.
I have to go to work.
I thought I lost you.
Mr. Draper. I didnt expect you back.
- How was your trip?- Great.
Would you like some coffee?
Whats this?
Mr. Cooper dropped those off this morning.
- Bert Cooper?- Yes.
Hes in the conference room.Would you like me to get him?
What the hell is this?
A client left here unhappy yesterday
because you have a little girlrunning everything.
My department is fine.
We just need more bodies,but Lane wont let us.
Youve been on love leave.
Its amazingthings are going as well as they are
with as little as you are doing.
Thats none of your business.
This is my business.
I have an announcement to make.
Its going to be a beautiful day.
