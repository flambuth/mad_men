When did you get up?
I dont know.
Is it still Saturday?
I need you to fixthe outlet in the dining room.
I thought you were goingto call an electrician.
All you need to do is unscrew the fuseand replace the plug, Don.
Sounds like you could do it.
I need to be able to plug in the hot plate.
Okay.
Okay.
Bets, come here.
Look, youve got a week before this party,
and it doesnt have to be a big deal.
Carla will help you.
Were going to have a house full of people.
Id appreciate it if youd take careof the things on the list.
Birdie, Ill fix it.
Thank you.
Hello.
Perfect timing. Ma just left.
I brought colored pencils for the boys.
Theyre out back throwing rocksat my laundry.
How is he?
I dont know.
I told you about the chiropractor.
Theyre not doctors.
Did I tell you he cried?
Anita...
Sometimes I think about Mike Ryan.Remember him?
Stop it. Gerry has a job.
He hates it.
He told me he hated it,
and then a week later his back started.
His buddies from workdont even come by anymore.
They think hes a malingerer.
And Ma, all she can talkabout are her bunions.
I checked out the nextHoratio Hornblower for him.
I was right. There is onlyone book about Moby Dick.
Him with the books.
Who is it?
I dont know.
Oh, Lord.
Hello, Father.What a pleasant surprise.
Well, Im sorry for dropping in.
I just thought that he could use a visit.
Bless you.
How is he?
Much better, thanks.
Good, good. Im glad.
- Hello, Peggy.- Hello, Father.
Let me see if hes awake.
No, please dont disturb him.
Nonsense. Hell be thrilled.
It means a lot that youre visiting.
You as well, Im sure.
Are you hungry?
Ive already been fed a few times today.
Its a wonderful community, you know?
It is.
I see you at church,but you dont seem very comfortable.
No. Thats not true.
You dont participate.You keep to yourself.
You know, there aremany ways to be involved.
Theres a committee for the CYO dance.
And for selfish reasons,
I would love to take advantageof your professional services again.
What do you mean?
Publicity.
Last years poster was girls in garlandsdancing around a maypole.
I dont think thats what the kids want.
No. They dont.
Im so busy right now, Father.
Think of it as pro bono.
Talk to your boss.
I really would like the kids to show up.
Hes ready to see you, Father.
Ill get you the specifics.
As of today, you are costing this companymore than you are making it.
Excuse me?
Tim Dunst called from Maytag.
Apparently, last night, their switchboardlit up like a Christmas tree.
- I didnt hear...- Youre head of the television department,
so I know you cant watch everything.
But who exactly oversaw the placement
of Maytag in The ABC Sunday Night Movie?
Well, I take full responsibility.
There was a scenewith a m*rder Russian spy
who was referred toas an agitator repeatedly,
and this led into a Maytag spot,
the title of which is "The Amazing Agitator. "
Really?
Is this all a big joke to you?
The Russians are still our enemy, you know.
This will not happen again.
Crane, were eating this one.
Politics aside, you need to be aware
that a client will takeany excuse not to pay us.
You need to getyour department in line, or Ill gut it.
Yes, sir.
Ill get to the bottom of this.
Hey, Harry, whats the nameof that place we went to
with the wallpaper and the kebabs?
I dont remember.
Can one of you help me read TV scripts?
For money?
I dont think so.
Theres too much to read,and I have nobody.
There are things to dothat I didnt know were my job.
How could that be?You made that job up.
I thought I would be a liaisonbetween the networks and the agency
and, I dont know, buy time.
Thats what your job was before.
So now what? Its a whole nother job.
Thats why we have juniors.
Someone to blame.
You need someone to lay downon the barbed wire
so you can run over them.
Heineken was pleased but confused.
By the fact that youdont use their product?
Thats why I brought Campbell.
So whats the problem?
Theyre set on competing at the tap.
We just have to find a wayto excite your average tavern inhabitant,
and theyll be happy.
Did you explain to themthat theres a market
thats actually excitedabout Heineken being imported?
For women entertaining in the home,Holland is Paris.
They can buy this sophisticated beer
and proudly walk it into the kitcheninstead of hiding it in the garage.
Im just telling you I sensed resistance.
If you want to get some research,
Ill get them into a room with you again.
Okay.
Well go up and down the Hudson,
northern New Jersey,Connecticut, the cash belt...
set up a few end-aisledisplays at the A&Ps,
away from the other beer,
surrounded by cheese and crackersand toothpicks with cellophane tips.
We can try that.
Maybe short, uneven stacks.
Make it look popular.
Plus, housewives love green.
Well go make some calls.
Youre still going to have to sit downand sell this to them.
By the way,I hate to disappoint your wife,
but I dont know about Sunday night.
Id worry more about disappointing Roger.
He seemed to think it was importantthat we sit down with Crab Colson.
And believe me, Im sure my wifewould rather go see a movie.
Whos Crab Colson?
Rogers and Cowan.
Ill get the time from your girl again.
Mr. Sterling is here to see you.
Send him in, please.
- Roger.- Crane.
Mitch says you wantto expand your department.
Looks pretty big already.
Well, the way other television departmentshave this set up...
and Ive checked on this...
there should be a dedicated manfor Broadcast Operations.
And what is he dedicated to?
Reading scripts, meetings to discuss.
Im really the face of the televisiondepartment for the clients.
Have you noticed were full up?
Whos going to pay this person, you?
The money we save avoiding surpriseswill make it worthwhile.
You smoke, Crane?
Sometimes.
How do I know youre not just goldbricking?
Because thats what Mitch thinks.
I dont want to speak out of turn...
Warren, do you mind?
I dont think Mitch has been very happywith my recent promotion.
Are you?
Yes, of course.
Figure out a way to do the job yourself.
You better not repeat any of that to Mitch.
Peggy Olsons office.
May I speak with Miss Olson?
This is Father John Gill calling.
Peggy Olson speaking.
Hello, Peggy.This is Father John Gill.
Do you have a minute?
Yes. Did you get the flyer?
Yes.
Its good, but can you takewhatever this is
and make it into a poster?
What do you mean, whatever this is?
Well, theres been some discussion.
Dont you like it?
The CYO committee is curiousabout "A Night to Remember. "
Whats the problem?
Well, they feel it sendsthe wrong message to the girls.
Its wholesome and romantic.
And you have to get the girls.
Its the only way the boys will come.
Well...
Tell them that this is the way it works,
and I know better than them.
Peggy, couldnt you just speak with them?
They just want to feel involved.
Of course.
Id love to hear their thoughts.
Good-bye, Father.
Good-bye.
Unlike some deodorants,
Fresh doesnt promise youeternal romance.
Mr. Crane, may I be of some assistance?
Im sorry.
What?
I received a memofrom Mr. Sterlings office,
saying that you needed a girlto help you with your workload.
No, thats not exactly what I asked for.
Well, I dont know what you had in mind,but we are spread very thin.
Hello, Joan.
Hello, Warren.
You...
You look great today.
Thank you, Warren.
I need someone to runour commercial scripts
past the networks for approval.
Cant you just use a messenger?
No. That person also has to readthe network scripts for me
and really make sureour clients arent misrepresented.
I dont feel comfortablesending my girls out of the building,
but I will find someone to read the scripts.
My wife is pregnant.
I just want to get out of hereat a reasonable hour.
How many are there?
And what are they looking for?
We just want to nipany problems in the bud.
For example, if a kids pushing awayhis dinner in disgust,
just make sure its notGortons fish sticks.
You know, people cant becoughing and dying
right before a Lucky ad.
Things like that.Its common sense, really.
It sounds interesting.
It is. For the first few.
And theres Maytag in there.
Theyre very sensitive to Communism.
Why cant I do that?
Because you already have a job.
No. I mean talk to her like that.
Shes so much woman.
You are so graceful.
She is adorable.
Theyre doing Winnie the Pooh this year.
Shes going to be Piglet.
Its all very professional-looking.
Cheryls 14. She wont even waltzon my feet anymore.
Ours is engaged.
Enjoy it while you can.
Crab, can I get you another one of those?
Like the song says, Id be a fool to say no.
- Roger?- Ladies first.
All right, the evening show is over.
Bedtime. Say good-bye to everybody.
Good night.
Good night.
- Good night, slugger.- Good night.
Hello.
Hello, Mrs. Draper.
Betty.
These are beautiful.
Im sorry Im late. My date cancelled.
You should have called.
I might have been able to replace her.
Carla, would you pleaseput these in water?
And our head count is now seven.
What a lovely home.
Hello, Duck.
I remember you, Sally.
Hello.
And who do we have here?
This is Bobby.
Bobby, shake Mr. Phillips hand.
Do you like baseball, Bobby?
Come on. Lets go to bed.
Sorry Im late.I didnt want to come stag.
Nobody cares.
I dont know.My wife hated odd numbers.
Well, hello, there.
Duck Phillips, you know Mona.
Of course.
Hello.
Of course this is Petra and Crab Colson.
Crab, Duck. Duck, Crab.
Can I get you something?
Tomato juice, if you have it.
Come on.
Ill have something with dinner.
Beautiful drive.
- Did you take the Sawmill?- I did.
Found myself headingto New Rochelle by accident.
I used to live there.
Its lovely there.
Ill tell you the way to go.
Were taking our sloopfrom my folks place in Old Lyme
all the way down to Larchmontfor Race Week.
We should get a boat.
My father had a boat. Almost k*ll him.
You might as wellcut a hole in your pocket.
The slip and the dry dockand the yacht club.
Speaking of which, Don,
are you and Bets joiningWillow Caks or not?
Were lonely.
If you wish, you canleave your drinks here
and join us in the dining room.
Terrific.
So, Rogers & Cowan.
Its a good place to be right now.
He does everythingyou need him to do, you know?
Well, we took the road that goes to...
How did that get there?
Were going to take a little triparound the world,
starting in Spain with gazpacho,
followed by Japan... rumaki...
and then well stop by Duchess County
for a leg of lamb, mint jelly,
accompanied by egg noodles,
the way my grandmothermade them from Germany.
And we have a choiceof g*n from France
or a frosted glass of beer from Holland.
Did you bring a case from work?
No.
Oh, please, Draper.
Youll do anything to win an argument.
I dont understand.
You went out and bought that?At the store?
Carla did some of the marketing,
but no, I did. Why?
Im not even allowed to pick where I sit.
Whats so funny?
Crab, if you want to be in business
with someone who knows their stuff...
Heineken is one of our clients.
He said you were the market, and you are.
- That is funny.- Incredible.
What an interesting experiment.
I have to sit down.
Please do.
Now who wants wine?
Please start.
The soup is delicious.
To our hosts.
And their idyllic country home,
and to new friends.
Hear, hear.
"A Night to Remember"is every girls dream.
It holds the wholesome promiseof the kind of hand-holding
that eventually leads to marriage.
I think its exactly what we talked about.
I dont like the way theyre dancing.
Theyre too close together.
Maybe leave some roomfor the Holy Ghost.
Uh, maybe theyre doing a box step.
Fine.
Youre not worried abouthaving a dance full of girls only?
When the boys hearthat the girls are going...
The boys arent going to hear nothing.
They dont go to school together.
They go to church together.
And this isnt the first CYO event.
Thats true.
Id never thought about that,but youre right.
Im just saying Im not an expert,
but there might be another slogan.
What do you want, two flyers?
No. We dont have tothrow this one away,
but maybe we can, um...
I think shes sayingmaybe we should try something else.
Thank you very much.Ill see what I can do.
Youre such a doll.
Could I speak to you a minute?
Father, I wanted to talk to you, too.
We can speak tomorrow.
Thank you all for yourgenerosity and your time.
Father, I dont mind working,
but this is completely unnecessary.
Well, I dont understand.
Did you agree with them?
The dancers could be farther apart,
but you were very persuasive.
You dont have to agree with them.
In fact, youre not supposed to.
You asked me to do thisbased on my expertise.
Well, Im not really on the committee.
Im more of a liaison.
Youre supposed to tell themthat they should trust me.
Thats your job.
Theyll listen to you.
Youre right.
Im sorry this is so much work.
No, I can turn it around.
And the copy machine?
Yes, I cleared it.
Im sorry, Father.
I dont mean to be disrespectful.
Im very tired.
Well both be prepared next time.
Come on.
Good night, Peggy.
I really am glad youre here.
Me, too.
You didnt set the table?
Im sorry. You came back so fast.
Ill get plates.
Youre not going to believe what happenson As the World Turns.
Youre right about that.
Let me ask you something.
Is it possible for someoneto come out of a coma
and have no recollection of who they are?
Honestly, people dontcome out of comas much.
Really?
So its also probably ridiculous
they would have an accentthey didnt have beforehand?
Yes.
Well, it must have happened to somebody.
I mean, they wouldntmake it up completely, right?
Probably once. Makes a good story.
Im going to get my drink.Do you want something?
Water.
I didnt know you were such a reader.
Its part of my job.
I thought you just walked aroundwith people staring at you.
You.
What are you bothering with that for?
You should be looking for a house.
What happened to your fascinationwith Glen Cove?
You told me to stop looking.
Well, I just need to finish my training.
Joanie, you should be watchingthose shows, not reading them,
with a box of bonbons on your lapto soothe your cravings.
Its a hoot.
I guess thats okay.
Im glad you approve.
Were you going to get mea glass of water, hon?
Of course.
Carla, why dont you go home?
We can do all this in the morning.
That jam will set.
Let me at least put the dishes in the basin.
Thats a good idea.
If you want, you can go to bed.
Ill show myself out,call Louis to pick me up.
Its okay. We had a long day.
Thank you for all your help.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Good night, Carla.
It was a great success.
Hey.
You embarrassed me.
What are you talking about?
You embarrassed me.
What did I do?
You knew I would buy that beer.
So what?
Because you know me so well.
You know everything about me.
Bets, I use our life allthe time in my work.
They pay me for that.
And then you laughed.
You all laughed.
Must be so funny being in on it.
Come on.
Youre taking this the wrong way.
You embarrassed me.
Im sorry.
I didnt mean it.
You never mean it.
You just do whatever you want,
and I put up with it because nobody knows.
No one is going to remember that.
You know what theyregoing to remember?
Petra Colson missing her chair.
Come on. Leave this. Youre tired.
Lets go upstairs.
Im not going to bed.
Not until you tell mewhy you insist on humiliating me.
Betty, I cant talk to youwhen youre like this.
Youre making a mountain out of a molehill.
I know about you and that woman.
What?
Damn it, Don,I know youre having an affair.
You and Bobbie Barrett.
What?
How could you? Shes so old.
Betty, thats ridiculous.
Im just telling you I know.
Fine, Bets.
What do you know?
Go ahead. Tell me.
Jimmy told me everything.
Jimmy. He hates me.
He told me everything.
Please. What the hell did he say?
So you can pick it apart?Twist all my words?
Im not going to dignifyJimmy Barrett with a response.
Hes a big mouth.
And dont pretend I dontknow how he looks at you.
I saw you two together.
You think you know me?
Well, I know what kind of a man you are.
You think I would sleep with that woman?
You cant help yourself.
Admit it.
Theres nothing to admit.
Youre lying.
Im going to bed.
Good morning.
Good morning, Daddy.
Mommy said the party was fun.
Did she?
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye, Daddy.
Arent you going to be a daddy soon?
Ive done my part. The rest is up to her.
Dont pay attention to that due date.
Itll drive you nuts.
- D Day.- Hello.
This is Mr. Pasternand Mr. Kostis from Maytag.
- Are we all better now?- Yes.
Process seems to be streamlined.
Wait a minute. Is she the onewe spoke to on the phone?


Yes. Joan is handlingBroadcast Operations.
I had no idea.
I would have combed my hairbefore I called you.
Ive got next weeks scripts.
Dont hold anything back now.
She wont.
Well, it was nice to meetboth of you in person.
Indeed.
Hell of an operation youve got here, Crane.
I think so.
Gentlemen.
Phil. Good to see you, as always.
Francis. Can we get you something?
Weve got a fridgefull of Heineken out there.
No. Its 11 a.m., for Petes sake.
Well, thanks for coming by.
We were just so excited,
I thought you should hear itfrom the horses mouth.
What exactly happened?
Well...
We explained to you beforethat research shows
that with the rise in commuters
and the relative scarcityof suburban bars,
people are drinking more in the home.
Yes, we heard you.
Entertaining housewives, etcetera.
Were not against it.
We just think our money wouldbe spent better elsewhere.
And honestly, I agree with you,
but, well, we ran a little test,
and the results were very enlightening.
Don?
We targeteda few wealthy suburban markets
with woman-friendly end-aisle displays.
Was there a spike?
The sample was very small,
but what we put out sold well.
More important was who it sold to.
This is an untapped marketwhere you dictate the competition.
I think I can say thisbecause Dons being modest.
Dons wife, shes a peach of a girl.
They had a dinner party.
Were talking days after placement,
and she had this elaborate, elegant setup...
foods from around the globe.
And sure enough,there was your Heineken,
right next to the bone chinaand the polished sterling.
It was incredible.
Not exactly scientific.
Although it sounds likeyou do know your wife.
Shes exactly who were after...
well-off, educated,with plenty of time to shop.
And its important for her
that shes the perfect hostess,the perfect wife.
We even talked aboutusing her menu verbatim
in selected ladies magazines.
Really?
We havent been there yet.
No, but its what Ive been pushing for.
And so I take your word on this?
Why would I lie?
Were the ones who aregoing to have to deliver.
I guess we could throw it in the mix.
Lets start regional.
See how some strangers wives feel.
I would recommendbuying air time during Love of Life.
Women watching TV during the day
like to fantasizeabout having active lifestyles.
They like where they couldbe going with Sea & Ski.
And they watch every day.
I know my daughter misseda lot of classes in college
for her stories.
My wife brought the TV home.
There you go.
Mr. Hansen, I dont knowhow Mr. Crane feels about this,
but Ive been reading the scripts,
and I just have to say
As the World Turnsis about to become unmissable.
I dont want to give it away,
but someone people think is dead is not.
Im glad you like it, but they all dothe same things, dont they?
No. Not at all.
This is what they calla special summer storyline,
and Ive spokento Logan Reynolds over at CBS,
and its going to receivea lot of promotion.
Is it the same price?
Well, theyre all close.
This sounds better.
Well, if you lock them in at this ratingand then they exceed it,
theres a bangfor your buck factor, isnt there?
I would say so.
Then you should do that.
I think youll be pleased.
Thats why I didnt wantto do this on the phone.
I love what she says,and I love the way she says it.
Let me walk you out.
Are you okay, Mommy?
Im okay, sweetheart.
Im just not feeling very well.
Do you want some aspirin?
No, Sally.
Im just going to rest a little bit, okay?
Go play with your brother.
Okay.
Shit.
Crane, thanks for squeezing me in.
You said 4:30.
Hell, is it only 4:30?
Sorry about that.
Listen, Ill be brief,
since it appears Im on my way out.
Ive received a lotof unsolicited phone calls.
Simply put, the customers are satisfied,
and so is the accounting department.
Keep up the good work.
Well, Im not doing it on my own.
Right. Thats true, isnt it?
Why dont we get those secretariesback to their regular jobs?
Its just Joan Holloway, actually.
So her attentions are divided at best.
Make it a full-time position, 150 a week,and he has to share an office.
Sounds perfect.
Hello.
Where are the kids?
Bed.
What happened here?
Nothing.
Nothing happened here.
I went through every pocketand every drawer,
and theres nothing.
Would you stop?
How much have you had to drink?
I dont even know why I bother looking.
All I found were stacks of cocktail napkinswith stupid advertising on them.
What are you doing, Bets?
I would never do this to you.
How could you do this to me?
I didnt do anything.
Don.
What time is it?
I dont want it to be like this.
Me, either.
I dont know what to do.
Dont.
Nothing happened.
Now you look me in the eye.
You never do that.
Yes, I do.
You never say you love me.
Yes, I do.
You know I do.
I say it all the time.
No, you dont.
Do you hate me?
God, no.
I love you, Bets.
I do.
And I love the children.
I dont want to lose all this.
This is a very impressive operation.
Its Madison Avenue.
Look at this.
Did we get Miracle Whip?
I dont know.
Makes a lot of sense.
Shes an undercover nun.
So, Turk doesnt know which way to turn,
hes so drunk, so finally he stops.
We get out of the car,
and the sign says "Bridge Cut. "
- Hello, Joan.- You wanted to see me?
Joan, this is Danny Lindstrom.
Dan.
Hes going to be in chargeof Broadcast Operations.
Excuse me?
Ive really appreciated you filling in.
I couldnt have asked for more.
Joan knows everything about this.
Well, that makes one of us.
Ive already given him next weeks scripts.
It would be great if youcould fill him in on how it works.
Right now?
Why not? Are you busy?
No. Not at all.
Its really just readingthe scripts, all of them,
and looking through the storylines
to see if theres any...
possible benefits to our clients,
how their productsmay be portrayed to their advantage,
and, of course,getting the cooperation of the networks.
Thats pretty much what I said.
Not exactly.
Listen, youre going to be aroundto help with the details, right?
Yes, of course.
Anything else?
No, Joan. And thank you again.
This is wonderful.Its completely a*t*matic.
I just leave it.
If you set the number.
You know, dont think we dont know
how lucky we are havingyou do this for us.
Thank you. Its nice to be included.
Peggy, do you have somethingyou need to talk about?
Excuse me?
Well, Ive noticed that youdont take Communion.
And I dont think its too much of a leap
to ask if theres somethingyou need to talk about.
No.
God already knows whatever it is, Peggy.
Well, then I dont need to talk.
Well, Im here right now.
Father, dont take this the wrong way,
but I dont think youd understand.
God is bigger than what we were raised on.
Father, you dont have to live lifelike the rest of us.
Maybe youre lucky.
Ive lived life.
I wasnt born a priest.
Of course not.
You know, when you distanceyourself from the church,
you are distancingyourself from everything.
Thats why its called Communion,you know.
Its not just being with God.
Its being with people.
I know that.
Well, then, why are youpushing everyone away?
Im not.
There is no sin too great to bring to God.
You can reconcile yourself with himand have a whole new start.
Youre a smart, beautiful young girl.
You have so much to offer.
Do you feel you dont deserve his love?
Your copies are done.
Ill put them in a box for you.
There you go.
Thank you very much, Peggy.
Ill see you on Sunday?
Yes, of course.
Welcome to the club.
So I pulled Sylvias hairand treated her mean.
She ran after me all the time,
and every day she took medown to the malt shop
to split a soda with her.
And just like that, I lose her.
How do you know you lost her?
Today I walked into the malt shop,
and there was another guyat the end of my straw.
Imagine my horror whena night on the town turned ugly.
This is a nice place for nice people.
And the jerk behind the bar,he throws a bowl of nuts at me.
What am I, a squirrel?
Lucky for him,
I carry my own wherever I go.
Am I crazy? I dont think so.
Just you try and stick your faceinto a can of nuts.
Take it from a nut.
Utz are better than nuts.
We have chains in almostevery suburban market
on the East Coast,plus Chicago, Cleveland.
Its a vote of confidence.
Mrs. Draper is on the line.
I got to take this.
Thank her again for me.
Hello.
Dont come home.
What?
I dont care what you do.
I just dont want you here.
- Betty.- Don, I dont want to see you.
Well, early in the morning
About the break of day
I asked the Lord
Help me find the way
Help me find the way
To the Promised Land
This lonely body needs a helping hand
I asked the Lord to help me, please
Find the way
When a new days a-dawning
I bow my head in prayer
I pray to the Lord
Wont you lead me there?
Wont you guide me safelyto the golden stair?
Wont you let this body Your burden share?
I pray to the Lord
Wont you lead me, please?
Lead me there
