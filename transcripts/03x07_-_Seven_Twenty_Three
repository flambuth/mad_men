Don?
What do you think?
Now, it may take a moment to get used to.I told you, men dont like change.
Well, its hard for me to judgewhen I cant see a price tag.
A modern Chinoiserie breakfront,
a Dunbar,Japanese-influenced sofa,
silk Dupioni drapes, Murano vases,
and a classic Drexel end table.
- And what goes here?- Where?
Right where were standing.
Well, thats your hearth, darling.Thats the soul of your home.
People gather around a fireeven if there isnt one.
- So, Don?- I think its fine, Betts.
All you do at work all dayis evaluate objects.
I would like the benefit of your eye.
Move the end table and the lampto the other end of the couch.
I think hes right.
- Hot as hell already.- Yes, it is.
I watched the sunrise today. Couldnt sleep.
- How was it?- Average.
Ogilvy wrote a book. I got the galleys.
They want a quote or something.
Advertisings already up there with lawyersas the most reviled.
This is not going to help.
Itll help him.
Its called Confessions of an Ad Man.
- I like the title.- Please.
Its a book everybody writes,only he got it published.
It should be called1,000 Reasons Im So Great.
- Is he publishing it himself?- No, Atheneum.
Ill send it over. I dont want you to buy it.
I dont know where to put it, and you knowI wouldnt be able to tell you if...
There you are.
When do you want usto move the meeting to?
- Mr. Draper?- Move it? Im 15 minutes late.
I told you I dont want them hovering.
If Im late, send them awayand call them when I get here.
Mr. Draper, Conrad Hilton is in your office.
- Right now?- He just walked right in.
- We were waiting and he blew right past us.- Hold on.
Come back in 20 minutes.
- Did you offer him coffee?- I did. Hes all set.
You look great.
- Twenty minutes.- You can take an hour if you need it.
- He wants to look busy.- Move it.
Allison, hold all my calls.
Connie. What a great way to start the day.
- 9:30? Its practically lunch.- Well, can I get you something?
Ive got a personal matter.Its not fit for the phone.
What can I do for you?
I dont know what Im more disturbed by,the fact that you dont have a Bible,
or that theres not a single family photo.
- Im easily distracted.- You should have those things.
Theyll make you feel betterabout what you do.
Start showing up on time.
Maybe Im late because I was spending timewith my family reading the Bible.
Are you nervous, Don?Im finding you hard to talk to.
Well, you caught me by surprise, Connie.I think you know that.
Now, youre a married man,so youll have to use your imagination,
but
I have this involvement.
I cant say its perfect,and my needs are being met,
but I have significant needs, Don.
- Do you catch my drift?- Yes.
So what do I dowhen my eye starts to wander?
Dont you have a coterie of trusted advisors,friends, kings,
that might counsel you better?
I want you to handle the Waldorf-Astoria,the New York Hilton and the Statler Hilton.
Its just New York,but my eye has definitely started to wander.
I think thats a good start.
Retainer, etcetera, thats for lawyers.Everything else will be like this.
Having me in your lifeis gonna change things.
- I look forward to it.- They always say that.
- A happy bunch.- If you say so.
Young people give us energy.Dont forget that.
Ill take it from here.
Its not much to start with,
but I look forwardto sharing my dreams with you.
Speak to you soon.
I cannot believe you just had a babyand you redid your house.
Are you suicidal?
They were notsupposed to be simultaneous,
and the baby wasnt the onethat couldnt keep a schedule.
Im assuming this meetingmeans youre interested
in replacing Francine as secretary?
- I am.- Good.
Because we waited for youfor our most pressing business.
The proposed 3-million-gallon water t*nk
will not only drainthe Pleasantville Road Reservoir,
but also blemish the naturaland financial health of our community.
Well said.
The Junior League needs to take overthis effort and explain the issues.
Now, first, conservation. The Silent Spring?
The majestic beautyof the Hudson River valley.
Second, worthless real estateon both sides of the river
because some industrial parkon Route 9 needs our water.
We need to go overthe Village Boards head,
appeal to the governor.The Rockefellers own half the land here.
Real estate, thats scary.
I may know someonein the governors office.
Who?
His name is Henry.
Youre gonna have to do better than that.
Henry Francis.
Hes in the paper sometimes,always right behind Rocky.
- What does he do?- Im not really sure.
- How do you know him?- I met him at a party for Dons work.
Here he is. Oh, my, it just says "Advisor. "
Yes, I know who he is.
He used to be the Republican Party chairfor Westchester County.
- I know him.- Well, call him, then.
I think we have a better chanceif Betty calls.
Its not adorable to pretendlike youre not adorable.
Call him. Hes a big deal.
Miami is where we should start,let it grow from there.
Ho-Ho wants it everywhere.
He just bought land in Seattle.Its an indoor city.
As long as he keeps writing checks.
Look, do you want tok*ll this thing in one blow
or do you want toshear the sheep every year?
Whatever you want, Don.
You made it clearyou dont want to talk about it,
but at least tell us how you know him.
We ran into each other at a party.
Thatll be all.
I know Roger will be the face of this thing,but I wouldnt mind doing the legwork.
Pete, I think youre supposed tobring in the account,
and Im supposed to beg to be on it.
What happenedwith North American Aviation?
Its going well.
My friend Russ,who deals with McNamaras office
said the orders are through the roof
for helicopters, carbinesand especially jets for Vietnam.
I think Ive convinced North Americantheyre going to need to spend more
if they want to get out of NASAand into the Pentagon.
When they do, we can talk about Hilton.
Understood.
Oh, no. Yes, of course.
Hes busy.
Its Wilson 4-8038.
Betty Draper. He can call me anytime.
Its a civic matter regarding Ossining.Thank you.
Lunch!
Wash your hands, Bobby.
Draper residence.
Mrs. Draper, its Henry Francis.
Yes, of course.
I appreciateyou getting back to me so quickly.
Stop it.
Could you hold just a moment?Im going to get on the extension.
Of course.
Im going in the study. Hang up the phone.
Damn it!
- What is wrong with you?- You said to hang up the phone.
After I pick up the phone.
Freeze.
Draper residence.
Its Henry again. We were disconnected.
Im sorry about that. My son.
I know how that goes. How are you?You must have had your baby by now.
Yes, I did. You remembered.
- What did you have?- A little boy.
Can you get him registered by November?
I just realized, everyone who calls youmust want something.
Actually, Ive been doingmost of the calling lately.
- What can I do for you?- Well, we were hoping
you could stop the destructionof the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.
- Whos we?- Im representing the Junior League
of Tarrytown.
They want to build a 3-million-gallonwater t*nk, and its a very scenic area.
I know the area.
Well, its practicallythe governors backyard.
Thats true, but I grew up there as well.
- Really? Where?- Mount Salem.
Im heading upstate tomorrow afternoon.Maybe I could stop by and take a look.
Well, tomorrow is Saturday.
No, of course. I work every day,I forget other people dont.
No.
This is very important to me.I think I could find the time.
- Is Swensons Bakery still there?- It is. And it has an air conditioner.
Ill buy you a cup of coffee, and thenwe can take a hike to the reservoir.
- Is 3:00 too late for you?- No, its perfect. Ill make it work.
Well, Ill see you then, Mrs. Draper.
I can save you the trouble.Its from him and its expensive.
Im going to fire her.
- What did you promise him?- Who?
Youre thick, do you know that?That present, its from Duck.
- Herm?s. Nice.- I hope yours is a different color.
"Elegance and success. Duck. "I wonder who wrote that for him.
- I dont trust him.- Why?
Because he wants us?
- Were very important here.- Who is?
- Did he put you on Hilton?- I dont know what youre talking about.
Stop barging in hereand infecting me with your anxiety.
This is really beautiful.
He sent me a box of Cuban cigars.
Although Im starting to thinktheyre not that hard to come by.
- Hilton Hotels? Did we get that?- Do you live in a cave?
Conrad Hiltoncame to see Don this morning.
- He was right there.- Really? What was he like?
I only got a quick look at him.He was skinny, like a cowboy.
My mother gave me his book. Hes Catholic.
- Its going to be a huge account.- Not as big as Lucky Strike.
But it would be nice to be playinga little offense for once
instead of hiding from the FTC.
- He has a book?- I really like this.
Look, Im keeping this.Duck said were not tied together.
Ill keep my mouth shutand you do whatever you want.
Do you know whyDuck doesnt work here anymore?
Because Don squeezed him outwhen the British took over.
So what? Don didnt like him.
Its the world against Don,and now its someone else.
True, but Duckwould love to hit Don where it hurts.
Well, Im not going anywhere,and Im not going to tell Don.
Im not worried about you.Im worried about Duck.
Send it back.
When were you going to tell us about this?
I thought Id let it bean incoming phone call,
and then wait and see who took credit for it.
This is very exciting.
Despite its modest billings,
London is thrilled with Hiltons potentialfor international growth.
Finally.
Huzzah!
If you dont mind my asking,how did you make this happen?
We travel in the same circles.
Well, I dont knowif we should celebrate yet.
His lawyers called,and theres a little matter of the contract.
Well, dont be afraid to push back.I agreed to the New York hotels,
but everything elseshould be under our terms.
I dont think you understand.This is regarding your contract.
Or lack thereof.
It may seem like a formality to you,
but to Mr. Hilton its a necessity thatall the principals in the firm be secured.
And honestly, I cant blame him.
- Ill give him my word.- And hell take it, but his lawyers wont.
Obviously, youll wantyour attorney to look it over.
Thats Ben Michelson. Its fairly standard.
Three years, a non-compete clause,a healthy raise.
Thats very generous. Ill think about it.
Im confused.
If someone handed me that contract,Id be filled with glee.
A three-year guarantee,a $5,000 signing bonus? I...
- Ive never seen that before.- Well, we want to take care of him.
Look, Ive gotten to knowConrad Hilton a little bit.
And I think hell enjoysomething he cant have,
and you should tell himthat it matters to me.
It matters to him.
Still, I dont think anyone told himthat it matters to me.
Well, this is the way it has to be.
And not just for Conrad Hilton,but for Sterling Cooper.
Id like you to take those papers homefor the weekend and think about that.
Id be happy to.
I met him once.Hes a bit of an eccentric, isnt he?
Yes.
Oh, Jesus.
- Mrs. Draper.- Mr. Francis.
Im alone. I hope thats okay.
Oh, well. Actually,my friend couldnt get away either.
- I appreciate your coming up.- Please. I love coming back here.
- So much changes, so much doesnt.- Like what? Im interested.
Can I help you?
- Just an iced tea, please.- Thats fine for now.
- What was I saying?- You were talking about coming back here.
Ossining has always beena real mix of people.
Well, after living in Manhattan,it wasnt my first choice,
but its grown on me.
I lived in Manhattan when I was married.
Its okay for work, but I cant sleepwith all those people on top of me.
Like in a skyscraper. May I have a straw?
So, you have your folder.
I thought Id just give you the literatureand a copy of the petition.
I dont know that Im a great spokesman.
You dont have to tell mehow beautiful the reservoir is.
- I used to do jackknives into it.- We drink that water.
Ive looked into this for you,and Im afraid its underway.
Oh, no. Were too late.
Maybe if you knew somebodywith some clout.
I dont even know what you do.
Im a classic strategist, fundraiser,maybe campaign manager.
- Im waiting on that.- And how do you become that?
- Give a lot of money?- No.
No, Im a lawyer, but I dont use it much.
We all have k*ll we dont use.I was an anthropology major. Imagine that.
- Where?- Bryn Mawr.
Well, you may besaving your community right now.
Im hungry. Do you mind?
- I dont know.- Fine.
You can read from your folderand watch me eat.
Ill have apple pie and...
Ice cream or cheddar cheese?
One of each.
Can we just get one thing out of the way?
I dont know what I can doabout the water t*nk.
Dont give up so easily.
What this really is, is a camera obscura.
We call it a sun scope.
And it allows us to look at the eclipsewithout injury to our eyes.
- We didnt bring a scissor.- I have scissors.
And squares of cardboardthat already have pinholes in them.
And if you really need some help,ask your dads.
The eclipse is 22 minutes away.Gentlemen, start your engines.
I could have gone golfing.I had no idea this is what wed be in for.
Go ahead. Ill take Ernie home.
You know, Francine taught schoolwhen we were first married.
I used to love seeing herstanding in the middle of those little kids
like a telephone pole. Hey.
There you go.
Sally has a crush on her.
Why cant you stare into the eclipse?
Whats it going to do, really?I stare at the sun every day.
- You stare at the sun every day?- Well, you know, look at it.
You know, I see her sometimeswhen Im out running in the morning.
- You run?- Yeah, over by the high school track.
- Do you talk?- No. No, theres an etiquette to it.
You keep to yourself.
And honestly, thats one of the thingsI love about my run, is being alone.
Thats hard to come by, you know?
Listen, I hate to disappoint you,but I have to be on my way.
- Thats too bad.- I have to be in Albany for dinner.
His masters voice.
The governor.
"His masters voice"? Its an old ad.
I know what it is.
- What are you doing?- Its the eclipse.
He made a contraption.
Dont look at it.
Are you okay?
I think so. I feel a little dizzy.
Take a deep breath.
Is that better?
So you never had timeto go to the reservoir anyway.
I only had an hour, but I figured...
Thats what you need. A fainting couch.
Whats that?
Victorian ladies would get overwhelmedfrom corsets and things.
Theyd need a place to lie down.
- How do you know that?- I used to move furniture.
May I walk you to your car?
- I dont know. This is still a small town.- No, of course.
- Mrs. Draper.- Betty.
Henry.
So, thats a rain check for the hike.Ill contact you as soon as I know anything.
You doing okay?
- You dont want to watch it?- I will once it gets a little further along.
I dont know if you heard me before,but it only happens once every 10 years.
You dont want to miss it.
- Hows your summer going?- Its good.
- Are you gonna take a vacation?- I dont think so. Ill get August off,
then September Im back at it.Its all fairly prescribed.
Have you been here in August?Its a ghost town.
- Where are you going?- Well be here.
So now I know that.
Most just come right outand ask if Im going to be around.
I was just making conversation.You can change it if you want to.
Youre all the same.The drinking, the philandering.
They dont know that word.
Do you want me to leave you alone?Just say so.
- Its hard because this happens a lot.- Nothing is happening. Were just talking.
Okay.
And where I come from,schoolteachers, especially, used to say
you shouldnt judge a book by its cover.
- So youre different, huh?- Is that impossible?
Youre all wearing the same shirt.
So how do people live elsewhere?
They dont have as much.They dont get as bored.
Im not bored.
Miss Farrell. Miss Farrell. I can see it. Look!
Let me see it with you. Show me.
Yes, is he in?
Tell him its Peggy Olson regarding Clorox.
Of course.
Hello.
Miss Olson, what a pleasant surprise.
I havent changed my mind,and Id appreciate you not sending things.
- Things you want to keep?- Im sending it back.
And I hope you take thatas a definitive answer.
I would if you already sent it.
Listen. Ive been having meetingsat The Pierre all day, suite 600.
At 4:30, Herm?s comes by.Give it back in person.


- Why are you meeting at The Pierre?- Have you been to Grey?
Its a Penn Station toiletwith Venetian blinds.
I cant do that.
You can and you will,then Ill leave you alone.
Suite 600 at 4:30, not the other way around.
Please dont contact me again.
- How was your weekend?- Short.
- What did Michelson think of the contract?- He hasnt gotten back to me.
Thats because he didnt get it. I called him.
Are you afraid youre going to have a boss?You will, the client.
- Its not that.- What is the problem?
You think youre more dangerouswithout a contract?
You are, and its affecting our business.
Youre our David Ogilvy,
and if you let all the blokes at Putnam,Powell & Lowe relax for three years,
maybe we could put your name out front.After mine. And Cooper, probably.
Well, Ill let you get back to work.All I need is a letter of intent.
Ben Michelson can r*pe us later.Grunt once for "yes. "
The problem is, I dont knowif you dont want to do this here
or you dont want to do this at all.
Didnt we give you an office?
I just need a minute.I need to send Martinsons to the printer.
Come on in.
So, do you knowwho youre gonna put on Hilton yet?
No.
Well, I dont knowif they want a womans point of view,
- but I read his book, and...- Who told you
we were going to land Hilton?Because were not.
And I resent you bringing workin here under pretense.
- I didnt.- I didnt need to sign off on this.
Im sorry if... I was excited.
And I heard there wasan amazing assignment.
And you thought youd come in hereand ask for it because I never say no.
You say no all the time.
What do I have to do for you?Peggy, tell me.
You were my secretary,
and now you have an office and a jobthat a lot of full-grown men would k*ll for.
Every time I turn around,youve got your hand in my pocket.
You want a raise. You want this account.
Put your nose downand pay attention to your work,
because theres not one thingthat youve done here
that I couldnt live without.
Im sorry, Don.
Youre good. Get better.Stop asking for things.
Close the door.
Draper residence.
Betty. Roger Sterling. How are you?
- Im well, thank you.- Is Don about?
No, hes not home yet. Shall I leave word?
Actually, Betty, if I could be frank,its important.
- Whats wrong?- Well, its a little touchy.
I dont want to put youin a strange position.
- Whats wrong, Roger?- Well, its about his contract.
What about it?
Look, I know you have to beon the same page as him,
and hes your husband.But its a lot of money, Betty.
- Three years isnt that long, you know.- Im sorry. What do you want?
I want you to see what you can doto get him to sign it.
I know youre the woman behind the man.
Don is going to dowhatever hes going to do.
And honestly, I find it terribly disrespectfulthat you would go behind his back.
- Easy, Betty, thats not...- I have to go.
You missed Herm?s.I was going to give you 10 more minutes.
You came all this way, have a drink.
- What are you having?- Whatever youre having.
- Im not having anything.- A whiskey.
- You are Dons girl, arent you?- I was raised on whiskey.
Sit down.
A few minutes of adult conversation,and we both go home.
Grey has Herm?s, Macys,
H.J. Heinz baby food and Revlon.
- You need someone in a skirt.- Everybody does.
Copy chief?
Maybe once they get used to you,but definitely more money.
- Would I get to go to Paris for Herm?s?- They come here,
but youre not going anywherewhere you are.
- I cant.- Okay.
Just so you know,thats what opportunity looks like.
Im just sorryI wont be seeing you every day.
What are you doing?
I was just thinking about all the timesIve walked by you and didnt even notice.
How is that possible?
What do you want from me?
I want to take you in that bedroom,lock the door,
take your clothes off with my teeth,throw you on the bed
and give you a go-aroundlike youve never had.
Bobby, Sally, turn off the TVand go upstairs.
- Whats wrong?- Roger Sterling called.
He pretended to be calling for you, and thenhe started on me about your contract.
- What?- Your contract, Don.
It was very uncomfortable.
- What are you doing?- What do you think?
- Im calling him.- Dont.
Betts, dont worry about my job.
Why would I?I dont know anything about it.
They offered you a contractand you didnt say a damn thing to me.
I had to hear about it from him.And why the hell wont you sign it?
It doesnt concern you. Youre taken care of.
Why wont you sign it?
Let me explain something to youabout business,
since, as usual, youre turning thisinto something about yourself.
No contract means I have all the power.They want me, but they cant have me.
Youre right.
Why would I thinkthat has anything to do with me?
Its three years, Don.
Whats the matter? You dont knowwhere youre going to be in three years?
Good night.
I love the taste of liquor on your breath.
- Where you headed?- Niagara Falls.
But well settle for the nearest motel.
Hop in.
Thank you.
- Im Doug. This is Sandy.- Nice to meet you.
- How far are we?- A couple of miles.
You wanna knowwhy were going to Niagara Falls?
- Were getting married.- At Niagara Falls. Fancy that.
- People keep trying to talk us out of it.- Whys that?
Well, we dont reallyknow each other that well.
Well, we knew each othera little bit in high school,
and were not really in love or anything.
Im sure you have a good reason,not that its any of my business.
Im not knocked up.
Theyre passing a law that if youre married,they cant send you to Vietnam.
I dont know if youve served, mister.I dont want to offend you.
Again, none of my business.
Its just Im 1-A. Im 22.I cant get into school.
I kind of have a target on my back,and for what?
I think theyre reallygonna start sending people.
I have it on good authority that youre right.
Good authority? Are you a spook?
Nope. Im in advertising.
No way. Now thats priceless.
- But you seem okay.- Thank you.
Its a beautiful night. It smells good.
But everything smells goodwhen youre high.
Thats true.
Listen, Cadillac,
we dont have gas money, but...
Yeah.
- Theyre reds. You ever had them?- What are they?
Phenobarbital. Theyre my dads.
Give me one. Make it two.
- Does he know how to dance?- Who cares?
- How old are you?- Nineteen.
How old are you?
- Why cant you go to school?- Because its a waste of time, man.
- You like to watch us dance?- Yeah, you want to watch us?
A hillbilly knocks on the doorof his new neighbors house.
"Howdy, neighbor," he says.
"In honor of you moving into the holler,Im gonna throw a party.
"Theres gonna be a whole lot of drinking,
"a whole lot of dancingand a whole lot of screwing. "
"Sounds like fun," the neighbor says."What can I bring?"
The hillbilly replies,"You can bring anything you want.
"Its just gonna be you and me. "
What are you laughing at, Cadillac?
Look at you. Up to your old tricks.
Youre a bum, you know that?
- No, Im not.- Conrad Hilton?
You wouldnt expect himto be taken so easily.
- Shut up.- You cant be tied down.
- Thats right.- Look at your hands.
Theyre as soft as a womans.
What do you do? What do you make?
You grow bullshit.
- I gave him two.- How the hell is he still awake?
Everything okay?
Im worried that housekeepingis going to come in.
I put out the sign.Ill call them when were done.
- I dont know.- Come on. I love the morning.
What were you thinking? Its awful.
- Its an antique.- We discussed this for months,
and we decided antiques were expected.
Look around!You have ruined the whole room.
If you want to keep it,please do not tell people I did this.
- Good morning.- Fender bender.
Im going to get coffee. Do you want some?
No, thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
- Fender bender.- Im sorry. Mr. Coopers waiting for you.
Thank you.
- Good morning.- Sit down.
What do you want?
Sacajawea carried a baby on her backall the way to the Pacific Ocean.
And somewhere,that baby thinks he discovered America.
You, Don, have been standingon someones shoulders.
We brought you in,we nurtured you like family,
and nows the time to pay us back.
You cant go any further on your own, Don.
Would you sayI know something about you, Don?
I would.
Then sign.
After all, when it comes down to it,who is really signing this contract anyway?
I dont want any more contactwith Roger Sterling.
Don?
I signed it.
