Listen, can you mail this for me today?
Sure, Whitman.
Its going to be at least    cents.
Thank you.
Mama, Mrs. Winter is a busybody.
Youre threatening me.
Im glad he wants to see me,
but I... I dont want to see him.
Im working a lot right now. I dont have a lot of time.
I have to go.
Were you listening to my phone call?
You mean your personal phone call?
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Peggy, will you get me a glass of ice water?
Someone hasnt told the sun its October.
- Miss Holloway.- Mr. Draper,
its the Clients Luncheon.
Mr. Cooper said you were responsible
while Mr. Sterling is out.
Didnt you handle most of Mr. Sterlings catering questions?
Continue doing that.
How is he? Have you visited?
I have. Hes less sickly.
I hope he knows how concerned we all are.
- Good morning, chief.- Don.
Joans been a bitch lately.
Anyone else notice that?
Oh, absolutely.
- I like it.- Oh, do you?
This got kicked over from Ed Baltz at Compton.
We sent them Firestone last monthbecause of our conflict with Goodyear.
This is how they repaid the favor.
Look at that.
I think its a modified Lionel transformer.
Well, I never thought Id say this,but what does the research say?
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.
No, it isnt. Its "before" and "after" pictures
since the dawn of time.
Mr. Martin Buckwald, its inventor, he calls it the P.E.R.,
or Passive Exercise Regime.
So it needs a name.
The Electrocizer.
For a slimmer, better you.
That helps a little.
Regarding slimmer,
Buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials,
but unfortunately none you can take a picture of.
We tried to get our own testimonials.
Some of the fellas brought it home to their wives.
And?
Its tricky. I, uh, gave it to Jennifer.
She took it the wrong way.
She told me to wear it.
Violet has it.
She says the scales are the same,
but she hasnt given up on itlike she does with diets after a week.
Mitch and some of the other guys...
We had eight belts.
Again, theres been no weight loss yet.
Who cares if it works?
Theyre offering us commission on media,
plus a bounty on every unit upside of last years comps.
But fake weight loss claims?
Thank you.
What about her?
Shes obviously losing some kind of battle.
You may have to let it out a little.
Maybe you should put her on your regimen
of sprinting out the door every day at   to  .
What Im saying is she did a heck of a job on Belle Jolie.
Maybe lightning will strike twice.
I dont think Peggys the answer.
I promised Buckwald wed go with our big g*n.
Our big g*n have been silent.
Peggy!
Did you need more water?
This device is a new product.
I would like you to give us your thoughts on it.
Right now?
No.
Its a weight loss belt, it says.
It, uh, stimulates the muscles, imitating calisthenics.
Youd be perfect for it.
Why?
Because youre a woman.
And wed like your point of view.
Im getting another account?
Its an assignment, not an account.
Go ahead, sweetheart. Take it for a spin.
Uh, am I allowed to change the name?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thatll be all.
I need  .   for the phone bill.
I told you I never use it.
But you do use the saltinesand the Velveeta and the liverwurst.
I never even got any.
I had some people over
while you were out drinking on Tuesday.
 .  . Thats your half of the phone.
You should use it more.
I have work to do.
I dont know why you do that.
When I leave the office, Im done.
Do you have to go home?
No.
Good. I dont want you to.
I dont want to.
This is hard for me.
Mostly because I cant even imaginehow hard it must be for you.
I dont think about it.
I mean, I try not to.
Must be a powerful mind you have there,because I cant control mine.
I keep thinking about us being together.
We are together.
I know, but...
I dont know if I understand how this works,
where it goes.
Im worried its a fantasy.
Its not.
I told you, Im right where Im supposed to be.
I just havent figured out what to do yet.
Im sorry. Would you like me to wait outside?
Its up to you.
I, um, I did the work on the weight loss belt,
like you asked.
That was fast.
You asked me to.
And what is your unique point of view?
I wrote it down.
Summarize.
Its one day. I dont know if I lost any weight.
Do you feel different?
I wrote it down.
Peggy, youre saying even less in here than you are now.
Its hard to put into words.
Then you have failed.
You definitely feel something
that I think some women... would like to feel.
Where is that here?
It vibrates.
And that coincides with how you wear it.
Oh. I see that here:
"A sensation."
Yes.
It explains its success.
And it basically made me think
it was probably... unrelated to weight loss.
We now have a benefit.
And we just have to figure out how to put it into words.
Have another go at it.
I will work on that, Mr. Draper.
Peggy, just think about it deeply.
Then forget it,
and an idea will... jump up in your face.
Thank you.
Excuse me, maam.
I hate to bother you.
Im from the Frederick Air Conditioning Company,
and Id like to talk to you
about an opportunity to live in frozen comfort.
Im not interested.
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
Its a scorcher out here.
L...
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, we have many units in all price ranges.
What?
Im married to a salesman.
And Im sure my husband and I can brave another week
or however long this Indian summers going to be.
Can I come back when he is here?
I mean, a unit here or in your living room...
We wouldnt even have to alter your window.
We could just cut a hole right above it.
You see this gap?
Thats where your cool air, whatever there is of it,
is escaping.
From that little space?
Yes. And theres a science to how heat patterns work.
Now, what you need is a unit here downstairs
and one in your bedroom.
Thats if you have the right construction.
That would be nice.
I could take down some numbers,
you know, measure everything.
Write up an estimate...
something you could discuss with your husband
when he comes home.
I guess that would be okay.
You know...
my husband...
I think he would rather go to Sears.
If thats what you want.
You should go.
I can just guess what this would costand put it on your door for your husband.
Please go.
Fernando, we are pleased to hearthat case sales have more than doubled.
We still believe that most of the credit goes to your rum.
Say hello from me.
Bert Cooper says it is a unique pleasure working with you.
I just finished trying to talk Lucky Strike off a ledge.
Junior or Senior?
Senior. Hes coming for lunch tomorrow
to see if Roger is still involved.
And theyre having this lunch bedside, I suppose?
I invited him here to see for himself.
He called my bluff.
Clear tomorrow.
I need you to, uh,
draw focus from our guest of honor.
...was number   in his class at Columbia Law School.
He works with Morgenthau,
and having been captivated by himat more than one cocktail party,
he is a charmer.
I can see he does something for you,
but I dont know if this is the right time.
Because youre getting so much younger every day?
Because I dont know if my heart would be in it.
Are you seeing that goy?
A little bit.
Well, I told you I wouldnt let that stop me.
What if he were, um...
Youre mumbling.
What if he were married?
My goodness.
Jesus.
Nothings happened.
Good.
But I have been thinking about it.
The two of us together.
It feels so natural. I feel so close to him.
Really?
Hes married, but I dont think hes happy.
Obviously.
What does it matter? Nothings going to happen.
All I know is what I see in the movies.
Its magical, and then they start talkingabout him leaving his wife,
and then he doesnt.
I saw this one where the husband gets the woman pregnant
so he k*ll her.
You dont want to be that woman.
Go ahead.
Oh, please. Whatever it saysis going to seem related to this.
"You are your own worst enemy."
Thats yours.
You look tired.
I am.
Youre working too much.
No, its just...
Maybe.
Its too hot in here anyway.
You know, were losing a lot of our cool airthrough the windows in the dining room?
What?
Nothing. Its just something the salesman said.
What was he doing in the dining room?
What are you talking about?
You let a stranger in my house?
Dont raise your voice.
I damn well will raise my voice.
Do you have any idea what could have happened?
I could have bought an air conditioner.
Its hot.
Salesmen go into peoples homes every day.
Its like when you turn on a television set
and then you turn it off, it...
Look, you didnt want to spend the money...
Good night, Betty.
I feel like I should make a speech.
Get back to work.
Welcome back. You look good.
Honey.
One hour. Thats all you get.
You be a good boy.
I shall be both dog and pony.
Come on.
He looks like death.
I know. His hair and his skin are the same color.
Not really.
Thats the spot... exactly where it happened.
I can still feel it.
Miss Holloway, we brought you herebecause of your discretion.
Can you help us with this? His color?
Hey, honey.
Well, you know, we dont need Miami Beach,
but, uh, just do what you can do.
Can I kiss you?
I dont know if I could handle it.
We should have done this for Nixon before the debates.
Oh, the arrogance of that campaign.
Its infuriating.
Being the incumbent is even harder.
You cant just sit on your ass and look presidential.
You probably shouldnt get so upset.
Its not good for you.
I missed you.
You know that, right?
I missed you, too.
Oh, Joannie, Joannie, look at that mouth.
Youre not doing my lips.
My rouge is too dark,
but I have this light lipstick.
Youll draw freckles on me, too, like Raggedy Andy?
Look, I want to tell you something
because youre very dear to me,
and I hope you understand it comes from the bottom
of my... damaged, damaged heart.
You are the finest piece of ass I ever had,
and I dont care who knows it.
I am so glad I got to roam those hillsides.
Stop it.
I mean it.
Ive had a lot of time
to think about the things Ive done and been sorry about,
and being with you is not one of them.
Oh, Red.
Thats not what I wanted.
You look better.
I should have come over.
Thats a silly idea.
Damn it.
Soon the milk stains are going to meet the sweat stains.
Should we get out of here and let her sleep?
Id love to, but the doors noisier than our talking.
Shes actually a good sleeper, thank God,
even with the heat rash.
Poor thing.
And it actually gets hotter at night.
Did you think about buying an air conditioner
from that pushy young man yesterday?
Is that what he was selling?
He looked like one of Carltons squash buddies.
Made me sorry I answered the door.
He was very pushy.
He came in and started measuring things.
Don was not happy about that.
Don was there?
No.
Carlton would break my arm.
It was foolish letting him in.
Why would you tell him?
It just came up.
I wasnt thinking.
What did he do?
What do you think?
He lost his temper.
Hes very protective.
Just as you requested, a little of our local color:
Pastrami, cole slaw, sour pickles.
I like it.
Its Yankee barbecue.
Yeah.
Theyre all ours.
Here they are now.
- Roger.- Hello, Lee.
- Hello, Don.- Lee.
Jimmy, Preston, how do you do?
Its wonderful to see you.
Well, from what I hear,
you boys had all but given me up for dead.
I dont think its wrong
for us to express our concern for your well-being.
Well, I know how much you love your delicatessen.
But I know theres also something else
you want to discuss.
Youre worried about losing the lawsuit?
There were no damages.
But we lost.
But there were no damages.
Blame is one thing, malice is another.
I worked my way inside and out of the FTC.
Bought a lot of dinners in Washington.
You cant fight them.
Thats what lawyers are for.
Lawyers? Ive seen a girl fight harder on her first date
than these DC shuttlecocks.
Listen, Im a stockholder,
so I called Chester Conrad in the Surgeon Generals office,
and he assured me it would be at least three years
before they could compile a report.
But legislation is in progress.
We hear another year or two beyond that.
They speculate theyre going to putwarning signs on the packages.
Theres still plenty of timebefore we have to worry about that,
during which we wait to see if share drops off
before we run for the hills looking for a new campaign.
Is that true?
Well, it must be. He just said it.
Well, Ive been spending a lot of time with my wife.
Im glad we came by.
I missed you all.
You New Yorkers.
To New Yorkers.
May they always...
Oh, Jesus. Not again.
Are you okay?
Just give him some air. Give him some air.
Give him air.
- Im okay.- Dont talk.
This was stupid. Ill get the elevator.
No, theyre holding the elevator.
Im very sorry.
Mona, sweetheart, this was a mistake.
I tried to talk him out of it, but you people.
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.
I used to think you couldnt put a value on a human life,
but I never asked Bert Cooper, did I?
Sweetheart...
Go to hell, Bert.
I dont need to tell you that Donhas everything under control.
I dont know.
Without Sterling...
I may have a family business,
but Im not an autocrat.
I have a board,
and my son wants to be the executive of an aluminum company.
Ah, still, your boardshould give credit where credit is due.
Share?
We all like Don Draper,
but if I was you, Id find some way to show him
that you all do, too.
Hes a dead man, you know, even if he survives.
What are you talking about?
Most clients will put up with one coronary from a partner.
Cost of doing business. Two?
Are we going down?
I wrote, prepared, and sent out my resume this afternoon,
at company expense.
Look, it doesnt take a geniusto see whats going to happen.
Theyll bump Draper up to partner.
Everyone will fall in line.
Draper.
It would have happened a long time ago
if they werent so greedy.
Theyre already paying him his weight in gold.
Half the accounts at this agency came for Draper.
Frank Birmingham brings in a lot of accounts.
Come on. You sit in that conference room.
Frank Birmingham brings them in,
and while theyre dozing off,
Don goes through their wallets.
What about Mitch Sullivan in Media?
Hes fat, bald, and charmless.
You think Draper likes me?
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.
Its hard to tell with him.
He likes you.
I work at it.
I work at it, too.
I can tell you do.
You never know when hes doing it.
Theres not a man in this room
whos not holding Don Draper on their shoulders
so that he can reach partner.
Hes not going to fire you.


Who said anything about that?
No one. Its just...
You dont think he deserves it, do you?
Campbell, dont you know anything about business,
cleaning out the old guys?
Its good for us. It opens up spots.
My ma, she wouldnt shut up about you.
I told her I remembered you.
Isnt that nice?
You smoke.
All the time.
Its practically mandatory in our office.
Thank you.
Brandy Alexander for La Donna, and a Rheingold.
What, you dont like it? Ill send it back.
Well, my friend Joan always orders them for me.
Theyre usually sweeter.
Shes a scream.
She lives in the city.
Theres a bar in Manhattan where the glasses are chilled.
Whats in that?
I dont know.
So you drive a truck.
Yes.
But I bought my own route.
Wise potato chips.
Really?
Yeah.
I have an area thats just mine.
The route was expensive,but the hard part was learning that truck.
Special license.
We have a potato chip account:
Utz.
You get free ones? I do.
I dont know. I dont like potato chips.
You live out here, right?
Prospect Park. I have my own apartment.
Well, I share it with my roommate Marjorie.
Shes a character.
My sisters a secretary for Bulova in Flushing.
I just got a new account the other day.
I already wrote copy for Belle Jolie lipsticks.
Its going to be in a bunch of magazines.
Which ones?
I dont think you read them.
Theyre about high fashion.
Advertising doesnt work on me.
Its just a lot of people screaming at youfrom the walls and the TV.
If advertising is good, people never think it works.
How do they know it does?
Did they ever prove that?
Why are you insulting what I do?
"So you drive a truck."
You do.
Im my own boss, you know?
You get off the train every day at Grand Central,
and they spray you with gold?
Let me tell you, you can act like youre from Manhattan,
but you dont look like those girls.
Hey, hold on.
That wasnt nice.
I feel sorry for you.
I said Im sorry.
Those people? In Manhattan?
They are better than us,
because they want things they havent seen.
The Danny Thomas Show
was brought to you tonight by Post cereals.
All fine products of General Foods.
Post cereals.
And now...
Ill be up. I want to check on Roger.
Okay.
Hello.
Hello. Its Don Draper.
What can I do for you?
I dont know what you do for anybody.
Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.
After hundreds of dollars,
all youve managed to do is make her more unhappy.
I understand this is frustrating for you.
This has nothing to do with me. Its her.
You took a woman with a bad case of nerves,
and you made her weaker, not stronger.
Im afraid to leave her alone.
All I can say is that its a process,and time is part of it.
If youd like to expedite things,
we can put her in psychoanalysis.
What are you doing now?
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.
Psychoanalysis would mean a minimumof three sessions a week and optimally five.
Thank you.
Ill think about that.
Over there.
Theres no chair.
I really wish I could have come in and prepared first.
Sorry. This is the way it works.
Of course.
I only have one and a carbon.
Thats all I had time to do. Youll have to share.
Come on. Just give it to one of the girls.
Ready when you are.
Women lose weight so theyll feel good about themselves:
Healthier, more attractive.
Rejuvenate has a Latin root
which literally means "the return of youth."
The Rejuvenator gives you the flush and glow
not only that you might have after hours of exercise
but certainly as a young girl.
Isnt it nice to feel that way whenever you want?
Combined with a sensible diet,
The Rejuvenator.
Youll love the way it makes you feel.
Look, Im not going to wait to see how Don lands on this.
Im going to tell you its good.
Nice end run around the weight loss.
I think its good, too. But what does it do?
From what I understand,
it provides the pleasure of a man without the man.
Weve been replaced?
Thats why Mitchs wife didnt want to take it off.
Oh, Id love to see her in that.
Oof, shes already so hot to trot.
 th of July, that gingham halter
with the knot at the bottom?
She was falling out of it.
Jayne Mansfield.
Mitchs wife is very attractive.
Oh, I... I dont know her.
First of all, no Latin.
You sound like a valedictorian.
And the name still isnt right.
Lastly, you still might need to give usa hint at what it does.
I could be more explicit.
I was thinking of calling it stimulating.
I think you need, like, a code word,
uh, like... I dont know.
Like refreshing.
Ill think about that.
Oh, my God. Freddie, doesnt your wife have one?
Whats your point, Ken?
My point is, didnt you say she loved it?
Thats funny.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Freddie, Sal, you know what to do here.
Ill get arrested just doing the layouts.
Now...
that wasnt so bad.
Looks like everybody liked it.
I can tell.
Uh, Freddies wife does not look like Mitchs,
you know.
Good work, Pegs.
Come in.
Mr. Draper, I dont want to seem ungrateful,
but I think I could serve Sterling Cooperand you better as a copywriter
if I had my own desk.
You have a desk.
But now I have radio spots.
Peggy, the conversation of a raiseis not inappropriate at this moment,
but do not be timid.
You presented like a man. Now act like one.
I want $ .   a week more.
Jesus, what do you make?
$   a week.
Well, thats a   % kick.
Don, a word.
Cooper and Draper just went into Sterlings office.
Tell me when they come out of there, will you?
Sure. Ill just sit here and watch the door.
Thats all Ill do.
Who the hell do you think youre talking to?
Is he dead?
No. Quite the opposite.
They let him go home to convalesce.
And?
I want to make you a partner.
As a symbolic gesture,I think telling me that in here is in bad taste.
Thats the way it works. Roger knows that.
Im not adding your name to the masthead.
Im restoring faith to our clients.
I accept.
Ill start you at   %
and see how both you and Roger do.
Of course youll remain creative director,
and to fill the position of head of account services,
you are the only member of the blue ribbon committee.
Do I hire from inside or outside?
I just made you partner. Do I have to do everything?
No contract.
Of course youd say that.
Beware the nonconformist.
Im going to introduce you to Miss Ayn Rand.
I think shell salivate.
Is he dead?
No.
So whens he coming back?
You know, I think this office is too big for me.
I might need it if Im going to lure in Marty Brennen
as head of account services.
Then its true. Congratulations.
- Thank you.- I mean it.
You know I admire your work.
I believe you.
I hope you do.
And I dont think it can be deniedthat we make a very good team.
You know what?
I do like this office.
I think Roger would want me to have it.
That way hell always know he can have it back.
I hope youre aware that Id loveto throw my hat in the ring.
I am now.
Peggy, we have both had very good days.
You may leave your post.
Its  :  .
Im sorry. Thats the best I can do at this point.
I have work to do.
You can have your raise.
And Ill talk to Miss Hollowayabout getting somebody on your desk
while you attend to your assignment.
Can I tell her?
Sure.
In the meantime, go with your friends.
Celebrate.
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Good night.
Mr. Draper?
Good night.
Back away from the set.
Come on. Youll burn your eyes out.
Hi, Daddy.
Uh, I would have made you dinner,
but I called the office, and no one answered.
Should I fix something?
No. I was supposed to have a meeting with a client,
but it got cancelled.
I got made partner.
Oh, my God. Don, thats wonderful.
Don, you were right about letting people in the house.
Im so sorry.
I dont want to talk about that.
The heats supposed to break tomorrow.
Itll probably be snowing in two weeks.
