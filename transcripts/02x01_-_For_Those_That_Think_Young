Sit up straight.
Heels down. Lighten your hands.
Good girl.
There we go.
Now, if you can step over here.
Youre a big one.
Thank you, Lilly.
Have a seat.
So, Mr. Draper,
you havent had a physical in quite some time.
I eat a lot of apples.
What is it with you boys?
Why does it take an insurance physical to get you in here?
Whats the number?
Because that will mean something to you?
Its 160 over 100,
which is high for boys our age.
Tell me about your parents.
Living or deceased?
Dead. Both.
Ages?
My dad was 41, 42.
He died in an accident,
and my mother died in childbirth.
She was 22, I think.
How many drinks do you have a day?
Wine, cocktails, beer.
Everything depends on the day.
Days of plenty being?
Three.
Youre a high-powered businessman with a high-tension job.
Im trying to help you here.
Five.
And two packs a day, but youre cutting down.
Yes.
All right.
Any changes in the last year?
What do you mean?
In your health.
How do you feel when you wake up in the morning?
How do you feel?
You live too hard,
and not just at the office.
Itll hit you all at once.
Nope. No, Ive been... Ive been good.
All right, Im going to write you some reserpine to bring that down
and some phenobarbital to help you relax.
Youre 36 years old.
You need to take this seriously.
Buy a boat.
Breathe in.
So I wait for Becky to go play,
and I look in her pencil case.
Theres almost 20 dimes.
She stopped eating lunch.
I hate the dishonesty.
You should be glad she watches what she eats.
Thats the truth. She is slimming down.
Good morning, ladies.
You want to get off right here?
You can go right to your car.
No.
Hes a prisoner of w*r.
Because he cant ride.
A man that age doesnt suddenly take this up.
Hes 25.
Did he tell you that?
I think so.
He talks to me. Hes engaged.
Theres no point in being aloof.
I wouldnt know what to talk about.
Arent you funny? Are you scandalized?
No.
Well, if you must know, we talk about you
and how Gertie has a crush on you.
Shes a sadist.
Ill see you Saturday.
Dont you hate getting manure in that?
Little children. Whats the difference?
Look, miss, just tell me where you want it.
I could take out the lockers and use that wall.
The break room?
Dont take away the break room.
Im not taking away anything.
Believe me, this machine is a gift to you girls.
Happy Valentines, girls.
How are you going to wear that around your neck?
Its much bigger than they said it was.
I think it needs an office.
Come on.
Were already doubling up. Dont do that.
My roommate works at Ernst and Ernst.
She did her birthday party invitations on this.
On colored paper.
I told you, miss, Ill try as many places as you want.
Maybe we should leave it here for the time being.
I dont care. Im doing this.
If you think that if you start eating, were all going to join you, youre wrong.
Look, Dons not one to stand on ceremony.
Hes not going to care.
I made it. I knew Draper would be late.
I have some crackers in my desk.
So, burning the midnight oil.
Sall right.
Hope the words are good
cause he aint got any artwork.
You didnt have time to give it to Art?
You want to start living here?
Im supposed to be at The Pen and Pencil by 12:30 every day.
I was promised.
Look, Freddie, the eating is the thing.
Im sure you can have a drink.
Its an unspoken agreement.
I got you, Freddie.
Are these all the glasses, Peggy?
I dont know.
We have artwork.
Peggy, go see if we can expect Don today.
Thats a good idea.
Drapers not going to yell at her.
You want to be alone with that?
Im telling you, Draper knocked her up.
She goes away for a couple of months,
drops about 9 pounds, 8 ounces,
comes back with a job.
Dons been screwing me for the last three years.
Ive got nothing.
Whats everybody laughing at?
The great debate wages on about Peggy Olsons charmed career.
Fat farm.
I thought we had verification.
Do you have any idea when youll be expecting Mr. Draper?
I was expecting him at the beginning of work today,
but then he called and said hed be late.
He said he was going to the movies.
Pinocchio.
Thank you.
Are you insinuating something?
I wasnt doing anything, I dont think.
Well, I believe that.
I want you to imagine,
when you talk about Mr. Draper,
that hes standing right behind you.
And think about that whenever you speak of him.
Are you going to tell on me?
I didnt know. What did I do?
Do you know where Mr. Draper is?
No, I dont.
I think he was joking.
Lois, do you know where Mr. Draper is?
Hes out.
Thank you, Lois.
How is it?
He wrote some of it here.
Some of it on 23rd Street, some place they tore down.
Makes you feel better about sitting in a bar at lunch.
Makes you feel like youre getting something done.
Yeah. Its all about getting things done.
Is it good?
I dont think youd like it.
You wanted to see me?
I wanted to see that Valentine heart.
On my way out. Anything else?
Im taking Mona to Lut?ce.
Let me hear what the living are up to.
You love her.
What happened to the Jewish doctor?
Hes not Jewish.
Not anymore, but he was. Trust me.
Is he still a doctor?
You sound like a little girl.
What do you care?
I wish you every happiness.
Im well aware this is vicarious. I already said that.
I already know what day hes going to ask me.
Does he know that?
Because I have a feeling theres a penalty for passing that date.
He knows.
Mr. Phillips here to see you.
Send him in.
Joan.
Did you girls get my candy?
Yes. It was appreciated and yet unappreciated.
Anything else?
No, thank you. Thatll be all.
Got a second?
Nothing good ever started with that sentence.
Its not that. Its Martinsons Coffee.
Im excited about the possibility of that happening,
and, as you recall,
Martinsons Coffee has a unique problem.
Good. We like that.
Well, thats just it.
No one under 25 drinks coffee anymore.
Just Pepsi.
They pour it on their Frosted Flakes.
For those who think young.
Which is why I was disappointed to see Don
put Fred Rumsen on this.
So Freddie doesnt drink coffee.
He doesnt wear a bra, either.
He managed to do a good job on Playtex.
Its frustrating not to have young people around here.
Were a young country.
The president has a baby.
Have you been out there?
Its rotten with kids.
And the cologne they wear.
Real kids. 25. Even less.
Maybe one of those teams.
The writer and the artist together.
Clients keep bringing it up.
Talk to Don about it. Just for Martinsons Coffee alone.
Cant you talk to Don about it?
I thought this was the way things were done here.
Didnt you tell me you were a bridge between Accounts and Don?
Doesnt sound like me.
Look, Don has talent.
You know how to deal with that, dont you?
Just assume that he knows
as much about business as you do,
but inside theres a child who likes getting his way.
Hes not my first creative director.
This is about a sales reality and not personal territory.
Its what the clients are asking for, and we need to have it.
Whats the best way to make it happen?
Mr. Draper.
Any calls?
Yes, and there was your 12:00
in the conference room.
Of course.
Well, girls can say whatever they want.
They want the chocolates.
Right, Peggy?
Of course they do.
I dont do anything. Keeps them off balance.
Hey, chief.
Sorry were late.
I think the little ones need to eat.
What do we have? Dale, wake up.
I could just go.
Or Kinsey.
You want to go first?
Peggy.
I just wrote copy for Dale.
Well, this is kind of the gist, because I was...
Well, we were...
It just kept changing course.
"Mohawk Airlines. Theres a new chief in the sky. "
And I thought, following that,
"Most routes to Boston.
Circle the wagons, weve got it surrounded. "
And thered be wagons around a dot that says "Boston. "
I can almost picture it. Sal.
This is the first time Im hearing it, too.
So its about an airline thats flown by Indians?
Maybe a plane with some arrows stuck in the cargo door?
Thats funny.
Thats what gets peoples attention now, right?
There has to be advertising
for people who dont have a sense of humor.
I understand, Don.
What else you got?
Several more Indian puns.
Stop writing for other writers.
Luxury, service.
A lot of people are afraid of turbulence,
so its dead calm.
Look how level those drinks are.
"Wherever Mohawk takes us. "
Or, "Youll love getting there. "
Whats outside that window?
- Fluffy clouds. - Research.
I get on a plane, I dont care where Im going.
I just want to see the city disappearing behind me.
So we could take the clouds out of there and put in the city.
The Chrysler Building.
That Indian...
Its not about the majestic beauty of the Mohawk Nation.
Its about adventure.
Could be a pirate.
Could be a knight in shining armor.
Could be a conquistador getting off of a boat.
Its about a fantastical people
who are taking you someplace where youve never been.
We could dress the stew as Pocahontas.
With the cheekbones.
Hows his wife going to feel about that?
Air travels too expensive to waste on your wife.
You want to get on a plane to feel alive.
You want to get on a plane to see just the hint of a womans thigh
because her skirt is just this much too short.
Friday?
Tomorrow.
What does that mean?
It means you want to go somewhere, go up her skirt.
Thats the impression I got.
Carla, Bobbys turning blue out there.
Did somebody get a lot of valentines?
They made everybody give one to everybody else.
That defeats the purpose.
They had a party.
I see. Fruit punch?
Im making this for Daddy.
Its beautiful.
Ill see that he gets it.
Mommy, can I do it?
Okay.
I want to go riding with you.
- You cant. - Well, why?
Well, for one thing, its too dangerous.
No, its not.
Do you remember what happened to the little girl in Gone With the Wind?
You are taking a bath tonight.
They say once you start drinking alone, youre an alcoholic.
Im really trying to avoid that.
So I guess Im helping both of us.
Cooper wants younger people.
For what purpose?
Martinsons Coffee.
Last time Freddie Rumsen had a cup of coffee,
it was one of five being poured down his throat by a cop.
Well, young campaigns dont necessarily come from young people.
The clients like it.
The clients like the thrill of young talent.
So what am I supposed to do?
Dangle a Pepsi out the window
and see if I can hook a stroller?
I have some candidates.
This smells like Accounts to me.
I had Paul Kinsey make up a list.
He had no idea he was signing his own death warrant.
You want younger people than that?
What do you want me to say?
Tell Duck clients dont understand.
Their success is related to standing out, not fitting in.
Its a fad.
Paint him a picture.
Something like one wants to be the needle in the haystack,
not a haystack.
Donald, isnt it possible that the recently weaned
have some unique perspective?
Joy, enthusiasm.
Youre talking as if theyre some fresh version of us.
Theyre not.
Young people dont know anything, especially that theyre young.
Well, let me set this in a more appealing context for you.
Prove him wrong.
Happy Valentines Day.
I love this place.
I know.
So what are we doing?
Dont worry, we will be out of here before the singer starts.
Juanita?
Betsy Hofstadt.
Look at you.
This is so nice.
Don, believe it or not, you two have met.
I dont think we have, Bets.
- Don Draper. - Hello.
A pleasure to meet you.
A pleasure.
Juanita was one of my roommates when I lived on the West Side.
We were models together.
In that horrible apartment.
Do you live in the city?
Well, I do.
Curtis is from Detroit.
Automobiles.
How are you?
I work as a decorator.
How exciting.
I have a little girl and boy.
Of course you do.
It looks like everythings going well.
My God, that stone.
That was a gift.
Give me your phone number.
Tell me how I can reach you.
Does anyone have a business card?
I do.
I would love a nice long lunch.
So nice to see you.
That is not who I thought she would end up with.
I dont think its permanent.
Can you imagine still dating at our age?
Shes a party girl, Bets.
Really?
Really.
And how do you know that?
Well?
How stupid do you think I am?
Juanita Carson.
Should I get another one here?
What are we doing?
How does room service sound?
I came prepared.
I suppose people get lonely.
And its Valentines Day.
Be mine for $100.
How much is it, do you think?
I told her I wanted to have hundreds of babies with you.
Wow.
Hello, lovely.
Hello.
Happy Valentines.
Thats so sweet.
I got your little note.
Well, Hildy did.
You have to be careful about just putting things in my bag.
Come on, open them. I want one.
Okay.
The round ones are coconut.
Shouldve got the kind where they put that chart in the box.
I spoke with Jennifer Crane.
Shes expecting.
Thats impossible.
Harry didnt tell me anything.
Thats because he doesnt know.
Shes going to surprise him tonight.
I just got so distracted.
Dinners not for an hour.
Tweety.
Theres no reason thats bad for us.
I saw this dumpy woman on Second Avenue
by the Hungarian market.
And she had her daughter pushing a stroller
with a little boy in it.
And she was round.
She was expecting another.
She was just buying fruit like it was any other day.
The daughter was pregnant.
No.
The mother.
Its this big club theyre all in together.
Even her.
Well, rest assured.
She doesnt have what you have.
Jennifer Crane does.
Do you really believe that?
I guess not.
Hold on.
Whats wrong?
Don, its okay.
Weve got all night.
I wish you would just tell me what to do.
We drank too much, you know.
I dont even know where I am.
You should eat something.
Hello. Yes.
This is Mr. Draper in room 804.
Yes. Can you send up some vichyssoise and a BLT on white toast?
No. Shrimp cocktail.
Two of them. Scratch that.
Two shrimp cocktails, please.
Wait a minute.
Hello.
Yeah. Do you have anything special?
Anything out of season?
This piano was designed
by Franklin Roosevelt...
Oh, leave that.
How about this?
I want a half avocado filled with crabmeat
and a rare petite filet.
Two place settings.
And if its an American company
that you can help, I like to do that.
If its not, just as long as its the best.
I rather love this hall.
It has all the colors one thinks of
when one thinks of the White House...
red and white and blue and gold.
Its through this door that all the heads of state come.
And this is where the president meets them.
And here is where the Marine band plays.
They have "Ruffles and Flourishes,"
then "Hail to the Chief. "
And then theres a receiving line,
and then everyone goes in to dinner here
in the State Dining Room.
Wheres her husband?
...though the table now is not set up for that many.
Are there many state dinners?
Yes, there are.
There were almost two a month last year.
This rooms interesting
because it has the most architecturally unity
of any room in the White House.
Its really all 1902
when Theodore Roosevelt took the great restoration
with McKim, Mead and White.
Which of these pieces have historical associations?
There are quite a few.
You have to see this.
...Dolly Madisons sofa.
Thats Nelly Custis sofa.
No, I dont.
She was Washingtons granddaughter.
I feel so strongly
that the White House should have as fine a collection.
Its so important, the setting in which
the presidency is presented to the world.
What do you think it is?
I dont know,
but Im going to find out.
And now a word from our sponsor.
Their armoire?
Ive seen them in Connecticut, but theyre copies.
You know, Jackie has a real one.
In the White House?
I think so.
She seemed nervous.
Even when she saw Jack at the end.
It was like they were playing house.
Thats chocolate ice cream.
Or bl*od.
I couldnt throw it away.
Its French.
Well call it chocolate ice cream, and Ill work on it.
Well, Im sorry we missed it.
No time for television.
Stop rubbing it in.
Really. A room at the Savoy?
That takes thought.
Your night sounded very romantic.
I would describe it as delightfully disappointing.
There was a time when he overdid it,
but Ill take dull and know where I stand.
I agree.
What?
I ran into this old friend.
Juanita Carson.
We were models together.
Roommates.
She was in the lounge of the Savoy.
She didnt look cheap.
Except for this 2-carat stone.
But she wasnt with a date.
She was with a companion.
I dont understand.
Don agreed with me.
He was an old man.
Shes a call girl.
Really?
Butterfield 8?
I wonder what thats like.
I dont know.
New York... Manhattan... is expensive.
We forget that.
I used to look at people in restaurants with envy.
Don gave me a fur coat.
If prostitution is Don showing up with a fur coat,
sign me up.


I dont think its like that.
I just keep picturing Juanita at 22 years old.
We shared a room.
Talked in the dark...
I know we wanted the same things.
When I was 22, whenever I was really low on money,
I would call my father and let him know that I was going to Havana.
And he would, without fail, send $25 in cash in the mail.
He wanted you to have a good time.
No. Hes a degenerate gambler.
And it would always come with a list of instructions
of how to bet it.
Youre kidding me.
No. And he never won because I never went.
Thats criminal.
Whats wrong with the conference room?
Why dont we go to my office?
Plenty of room.
Braggart.
Nope. Were sitting here.
Im trying to figure something out.
So, Pops, we should celebrate your soon-to-be-fat wife.
Arent you happy?
Sure. I mean, its going to be a lot of headaches.
Things are going to change. But come on.
Hes really meeting with them.
Why are they doing this?
I guess you havent been privy to some of Ducks scoutmaster talks
about how we need younger creative.
Who said that? Did he say that?
- A few times. - Wonderful.
Look, were in the same boat.
Im sure hell turn his sights on us.
No ones been promoted in Accounts since he came in.
I cant believe Donald would listen to Duck.
Well, maybe Duck made him.
Nobody makes Draper do anything.
Let me tell you, Don Draper has a rope coiled under his desk,
and its looped around Ducks neck.
And Ducks going to run around and run around,
and then one day...
Theres a meeting? Nobody told me there was a meeting.
Can we change venues?
So, I have a lot of thoughts.
How old are you?
25.
24. But that r?sum?,
thats really just two years.
18 months, without a doubt.
Right.
Youre experienced, I gather.
Are you married?
Thats why were on the purpose.
Hes right.
We havent settled down yet.
So, again, you both did everything together,
and yet you get paid more.
Well, I have a writing background.
Short fiction. And Im a citizen.
But you contribute words.
Only when its a distance.
Im going to ask you a question
that was always asked of me when I was on job interviews.
That is divine, man.
Have you ever been fired?
I believe you that other people have them in the hallways.
I just dont know if thats right for us.
I mean, this is an environment for clients.
We dont want to appear to be bursting at the seams.
Lois, may I speak with you?
Theresa said there was an incident yesterday.
You were crying in the break room,
which I have specifically forbidden.
Im sorry, but Peggy...
Miss Olson.
She yelled at me.
Why would she do that?
Im good at my job.
The next time that you come to complain...
I wasnt complaining. You wanted to talk to me.
This is why I dont allow crying in the break room.
It erodes morale.
Theres a place to do that, like your apartment.
It came over me.
And I would correct your attitude towards Miss Olson.
Its unbecoming.
Yes, Joan.
Do we like this in the hallway?
I think it looks good now,
but I think it will become messy.
I agree.
Looks good.
By the way, it has Julian Koenigs fingerprints all over it.
His Masters Voice.
Also not mine.
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Smith.
Smitty. Kurt.
We have the same last name. We dont want people to mix us up.
It must happen all the time. You two share an office?
Works best that way.
Look at this.
Gentlemen, your reputations precede you.
Duck Phillips, head of Account Services.
I get a distinct impression.
Pardon?
Wed rather people not know we were here.
If it gets out were meeting...
- Of course not. - Yes, right.
Bye.
- Ill let him know she called. - Okay.
I like the direction youre taking.
Good.
Now that Ive given you your babies and your Xerox machine,
should I throw in a couple of elephants?
I dont want there to be any excuse
when you cant bring in Martinsons Coffee.
Dont get worked up.
You know, there are other ways to think of things
than the way you think of them.
The testimonials.
I was thinking we could get younger girls.
Sixth graders.
It would mean different publications.
Do they need Clearasil that early?
- Doesnt matter. - Doesnt.
I guess we could try that.
Two more from DDB.
Even younger.
Just assume that everyone on the list you handed Roger is coming in.
Youre an idiot.
I dont understand that. Im only 22.
You dont count.
Weve got to get him out of here.
Come on, Daddy.
How often do you get to celebrate getting some girl pregnant?
Campbell, youre buying.
We still have to show Mohawk to Mr. Draper.
Dales not here.
Mr. Draper doesnt care.
Kids. Whats the big deal?
Do you want to have kids?
Eventually.
Exactly.
Mr. Romano, Miss Olson.
Send them in.
Where are we?
You tell us.
"Where are you going?"
Are you going to underline the "you"?
For half the people, it will be,
"Where are you going?"
I also had "Come away with us. "
Where the hells Dale?
Hes sick.
I dont know. Sure.
Fine.
Its exactly what we talked about.
Its obvious.
Im uninvolved.
Move this up.
What about that?
I think its sentimental.
Peggy.
No, shes right.
Just because it has sentiment doesnt make it sentimental.
Were talking about businessmen.
Right. Businessmen who like short skirts.
Sex sells.
Says who?
Just so you know,
the people who talk that way think that monkeys can do this.
And they take all this monkey crap and just stick it in a briefcase,
completely unaware that their success
depends on something more than their shoe shine.
You are the product.
You feeling something.
Thats what sells.
Not them.
Not sex.
They cant do what we do.
And they hate us for it.
"Welcome back, Daddy"?
Is that a question?
"What did you bring me, Daddy?"
You can put that in your book.
What is going on?
Hes going to take it to Leon in Actuarial?
His stomachs so fat, its now resting on his desk.
Got to feed that big brain.
Hes a deal breaker.
Im a closer.
That Cecelia?
Sits outside Fred Talbots office?
You made that happen?
Silver tongue.
I got her three stingers.
Shes a little girl.
You have to give them an excuse.
Thats what I always say.
She had those panties that said "Wednesday. "
They were soaked through.
I love that.
Once the engine was running,
she wouldnt stop.
Shes so straight.
Youd think that.
Take your hat off.
Is there a problem?
Damn it.
Everything okay?
You know anything about cars?
No.
Can you tell them at the Esso to send a tow truck?
Okay.
Hey, Carla.
Hi.
Hey, Daddy.
How was your day, Mr. Draper?
I am tired.
Wheres Mrs. Draper?
She just went to get Sally from ballet.
Want a ride to the station?
No. Im all right.
Its a nice night out. I enjoy the fresh air.
Good night, Bobby.
Good night.
Good night.
I dont like it.
Here. Give it to me.
I just know when the smoke starts to come out,
I have to stop.
Thats true.
I got a fan belt on the truck. I could put it in for $9.00.
Hold on.
I have $3.00 and change.
I could put it on account,
send you a bill.
I dont want my husband knowing about this.
Its a new car.
He doesnt like the way I drive.
Thats got nothing to do with this.
Well, it would mean the world to me.
I dont know. You know, the...
the belts 2.55.
So theres nothing you can do for a damsel in distress?
Are we bargaining here?
Well, yes, I guess we are.
I could say no, couldnt I?
That would be a terrible disappointment.
It would be, wouldnt it?
Its not that complicated.
Thats a relief.
Well, thatll do it.
Have a good night now.
I will.
Polly!
Im here, too.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi.
Bobby conked out.
Where were you?
Mommy was late.
I got stuck talking to Marilyn Keckner in the parking lot.
Well, I was here.
Did you eat something?
I did.
Come on, show me what you learned in ballet.
Now I am quietly waiting
for the catastrophe of my personality
to seem beautiful again,
and interesting and modern.
The country is gray
and brown and white and trees.
Snows and skies of laughter are always diminishing.
Less funny, not just darker.
Not just gray.
It may be the coldest day of the year.
What does he think of that?
I mean, what do I?
And if I do,
perhaps I am myself again.
