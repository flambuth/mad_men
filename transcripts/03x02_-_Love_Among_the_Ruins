Is there more? I love her.
I saw Susan Watson do it on Broadway,and she was great,
- but she didnt have that.- Well, its not going to be her,
but they want that scene"frame for frame," as they say.
So, something about how desperate she isfor a Pepsi?
Its for Pepsi, but its not for Pepsi.Its called Patio,
and its a dieters kind of Pepsito help women reduce.
Its Pepsis diet-right cola,
and theres claims that their lawyerswent over calories, etcetera.
If we do it right, we land Patio.
And if we land Patio,Ill be at lunch with Pepsi.
- I think Pete Campbell just broke a sweat.- Im coming to casting.
- Were going right to casting?- You dont have to if you dont want to.
I understand why you like this,but its not for you.
- Im the one whod be buying Patio.- Youre not fat anymore.
Thank you.
Lets assume we cant talk them outof the name,
and lets assume we can get a girlwho can match Ann-Margrets ability
- to be 25 and act 14.- Is that what shes doing?
Is it just a knockoff?Are we allowed to make fun of it, at least?
- Shes fun and sexy. Dont be a prude.- Would you say that to me?
- Its sexy, and its what they want.- Clients dont always know whats best.
When we land them,you can start talking to them that way.
Pick it up.Bobby, back away from the stove.
Were out of Melba Toast.
Jesus, Betts, have some oatmeal.That babys gonna weigh a pound.
Carla must have had some,because I would have thrown the box away.
Are we gonna collect the whole set?
I thought you didnt mind herdoing the legwork.
You didnt need a decorator last time.Id like to feel like Im paying for something.
- These are $3 apiece, you know.- And I cant really judge by a picture.
Im late.
We should really spend a day in Tarrytown.Itd be so easy.
- No.- Those stores smell bad.
We are going to Tarrytown.
And youre gonna stareat some antique chair for so long
the buttons are gonna seem interesting,and then well go to Carvel.
See you tonight.
What are you doing?
I hope you received the packageshowing our campaign
to ease the wayfor the Ravenswood nuclear power facility.
It was very impressive.
Ive told Paul that youre facingan onslaught of negative public opinion
in your attempt to demolishthe Pennsylvania Railroad Station this year
and replace itwith the new Madison Square Garden.
We should have torn the damn thing downduring the newspaper strike.
No one would have noticed.
Now, lets take a look at the landscape,as it were.
"How to k*ll a city.Architects inhumanity to architects
"surpasses understanding.The new design is also ambitious,
"pedestrian and dull."
Ada Louise Huxtableis as green as that folder.
People know that shes an angry womanwith a big mouth.
Who writes for The New York Times.
I dont care if she wrotefor the Ten Commandments.
Shes trying to sell papers doing whatthey always do. Making people miserable.
My great-great-grandfather, Silus Dikeman,would have turned his boat around
if he had known that this citywould one day be filled with crybabies.
So whats your best w*aponagainst lunatics?
Fifteen stories, vaulted ceilings,pink Milford granite columns.
I dont think its crazy to be attachedto a beaux-arts masterpiece
through which Teddy Rooseveltcame and went.
Ive met the opposition. I know crazy.
Do you know wherethe greatest Roman ruins are?
Theyre in Greece, Spain,because the Romans tore theirs all down.
They took apart the Colosseumto build their outhouses.
This is the Colosseum.Have you seen the plans?
In The New York Times.
- Do you have a problem, buddy?- Hes looking for an angle.
You know those snide ad menyou see in the movies?
Right here.
Well, Ive got a mailbox full of death threatsfrom b*at like him
whod rather live in a teepee.
This is the greatest city in the world.If you dont like it, leave.
Well, well let you know.
You have no problemswith an atom plant on the East River,
- but this bothers you?- Its Penn Station. This city has no memory.
Out with the old, in with the new.Who says thats a good idea?
Im going to have to talk to Don about this.
Dont do that.
Look, now theyll trust me morewhen I help them.
Do you ever listen to yourself?
I hate you, you know that.Other than Wilma Flintstone,
I havent seen anyone carry so well.
Its smoke and mirrors.Ive busted plenty of seams.
Well, it makes me optimistic.
Greg has made it perfectly clearthat come July 1
and hes chief resident,Id better watch out.
- Hello, Mrs. Draper.- Can you get Mrs. Draper a glass of water?
Why dont you tell me firsthow long Im going to be here?
Whats so urgent?London Bridge falling down?
In a manner of speaking.
- I appreciate you stopping by.- Didnt you just call us into your office?
Well, yes.I thought it best if I told you in person.
I just heard from London.
Weve been sackedby Campbell Soup, Great Britain.
I dont want to have to walk down hereevery time we lose an account.
This is an advertising agency.Ill wear out the carpet.
Its not so much the account we lostas the account we failed to gain.
- So now BBDO has all of Campbells Soup?- Why didnt we have a meeting with them?
Perhaps I should drag Burt Peterson inand fire him again?
- Obviously Don wouldve loved a sh*t.- How did this slip through the cracks?
I dont usually set meetings, I attend them.
Well, if this is where we wanted to end up,we all did everything perfectly.
You ever get three sheets to the windand try that thing on?
Mrs. Pryce is here.
Nothing to fret about, as longas theres new business. Five minutes?
- Its definitely side to side.- Is that a boy or a girl?
Ill call my mother.
Look. Princess Gracejust swallowed a basketball.
- How are you, Roger?- Its not hard to adjust to happiness.
Shall we?
Good night, Mrs. Harris.
Im in a foul mood.
Ch?teau Lafite Rothschild, 49.Im very impressed that you have this.
Not bad at that.
- Where are you living?- We have a furnished flat in Sutton Place.
Three bedrooms,spectacular view of the river.
And were near the UN,so theres plenty of Africans.
Like the Bordeaux grape,may we all get better with time.
This is delicious.
Rebecca was curiousif you knew anything about schools.
In the city, Im a little out of touch.
How long have you been together?
- Ten years.- Nine years.
Fifteen for us.
- Do you miss London?- God, yes.
But what we lost in Londonwe gained in insects.
J. Walter Thompsonis opening an office in Caracas.
I dont know if the ladieswant to talk about that.
No, of course not.
The coquilles. Brilliant.
Look, I didnt want to be thereany more than you did.
It was just the cherry on top of my sundae.
What?
Tell me now,and not three seconds after Ive dozed off.
Ive been trying to get my fatheron the phone.
Of course I called William and, again,somethings wrong.
Another stroke?
- Gloria left him.- Can you blame her?
Yes, I can blame her. She came into his life,
he suddenly takes illand she abandons him.
Maybe she realized hes a son of a bitch.
Don, Im worried about him.
He doesnt sound right,and I cant take a car trip now.
I think William and Judyshould bring him up this weekend.
- Great, more antiques.- Its spring break. Itll be nice for the kids.
- Those girls are a nightmare.- Theyll leave by Saturday at the latest.
Why did you even bother asking me?
Shes really kicking.
- Mr. Sterling, your family is here.- Send them in.
If it isnt fall bride.
- Wheres Brooks?- Hell be along.
- Would anyone like anything? Coffee or...- Its 10:30.
Sherry, if you have it.
I told Brooks to come late.I dont want him to be embarrassed.
By what? That Im paying for everything?You just tell him thats the way its done.
No, Roger, its about Jane.
What about her?It was her idea to take you to Dior.
Why havent you returned her calls?Youre hurting her feelings.
I know what you think.
You think its so uncomfortablethat I wont even bring it up.
Well, youre being very dramaticfor a girl who didnt want a wedding at all.
Do you want me to say it?Do I have to say it?
Say what, exactly?
Ive suggested to Margaret a compromise.You and June host your own table,
- and Ill be at the Hargroves.- So, you get the in-laws and I get Siberia?
Are you worried about an odd number?Because Ill get your mother a date.
- I have a date.- Who?
- Bruce Pike.- What does that old saddlebag want?
I didnt want to go to her wedding,but I did.
- The least she can do is not come to mine.- Not come?
- Thats why I suggested a compromise.- Youre not even giving Jane a chance.
Seeing her on my wedding dayis gonna ruin it.
Shes young enough to be my sister.How does it look?
- Sweetheart.- Brooks! Thank God.
Mom.
- How are you, sir?- Not great, Brooks. Not great.
Can I get you something?
- No.- Thats okay. Ill have yours.
- Roger.- Were not married anymore, you know.
I like the silver and the bells.
Go with the bells. November 23rd.Ill tell Jane.
Mr. Pryce is here to see you.
Send him in.
Your wife is charming.
- She lifted Rebeccas spirits inestimably.- Im glad to hear it. They really hit it off.
I hate to send you into the lions den,but I think it best you take the gentleman
from Madison Square Gardento a nice lunch today.
Peter and Paul rubbed himvery much the wrong way.
- I told you before, Rogers the lion tamer.- Roger will join as well.
It will help if you tell mewho these people are.
All I could secure was Edgar Raffit,
vice president of Madison Square Garden,and hes irate.
What does he want?
A Cyrano de Bergeracto make New York fall in love with him.
- Today?- Do you have plans?
Have Campbell send over the folder.
Theyre wild Indians.
Theyve been cooped up since Woodbridge.
I fixed some lunch.
- Cold roast chicken, or I have cold cuts.- We went to Pats Steaks.
I got you a half.
- Have you all already eaten?- No, we waited.
- I even got Gloria a chicken parmesan.- Well, great. Well mail it to her.
Shes in Boca Raton.Shes not coming back.
He understands completely.Hes just playing it up.
- How was the drive, Daddy?- In the Lincoln?
You should take your Coumadinwith your sandwich.
So I said to them, "Its so crowded in here,I feel like Im on the subway."
Ive never seen anyone like you on the train.
Well, my husband wont let me.Its a figure of speech.
Have a seat,and Ill let Mr. Pryce know that youre here.
Sorry about that. I got tied up.
What else do you have to do today?What else do you have to do all week?
I barely made it here.
Ginger presses the buzzer,says, "Your familys here."
Sounded silly. Gibson, up.Thats gonna help.
To my knees, Don.Theyre bringing me to my knees.
- Sorry to hear that.- I made my bed, I should lie in it, right?
Your words, not mine.
Like its not hard enoughlosing my little girl to that kid.
Ive got her motherpouring poison in her ear.
Theres a land grab going on.
I blame Mona.
All of a sudden,I could give two craps about that wedding.
- All I want to do is win.- Gentlemen.
- A pleasure to meet you. Roger Sterling.- Edgar Raffit.
- Our creative director Don Draper.- Edgar.
Have a seat, please. Lets get you fixed up.
I only have a minute.
Edgar, please.Eat our sweetmeats, drink our wine.
I understand one of our copywriterstook a Yetta Wallenda-sized misstep.
The girl, the tightrope walker.
They got her off the sidewalkwith a hose last week.
The point is,we completely understand your problem.
- All we want to know is how we can help.- Youre supposed to tell me.
Well, Ive done all I can. Don?
In the interest of time,you want to demolish Penn Station
- and New York hates it.- Not all of New York. A vocal minority.
Can they stop it?
Well, I think all the hubbubis making it unpleasant for...
But they cant stop it, can they?
Why do you people insiston making us sound like villains?
Your concern over public opinionshows a guilty conscience.
Now what good is that serving youif what is to be done is already underway?
Leave those.
Bring a couple of iceberg wedges,blue cheese, bacon.
So lets sayI dont have a guilty conscience.
Good. And lets also say that changeis neither good or bad, it simply is.
It can be greeted with terror or joy.
A tantrum that says,"I want it the way it was,"
or a dance that says,"Look. Its something new."
- Would you draw the line at 50%?- Im not drawing a line at all.
PR people understand this,but they can never execute it.
If you dont like what is being said,change the conversation.
What is that conversation?
I was in California.Everything is new, and its clean.
The people are filled with hope.New York City is in decay.
But Madison Square Garden...Its the beginning of a new city on a hill.
- Just like that?- Its true, isnt it?
If I were to come to you,I dont want that kid on my account.
- The communist, the radical.- I will handle it personally.
Grandpa Gene is goingto watch his program now.
I just want to catch the end of the game.
- Move.- And the first pitch of the ball, outside.
- Daddy seems well. He has an appetite.- He eats constantly.
When I found out Gloria was gone,I was hoping he ate her.
- How could you not know about that?- I went by, but he lied to me.
Then, finally, when I let myself in,he went bananas.
Hes ashamed.
Judy can get through to him.
Hes down in the dumps,but he seems very clearheaded.
Thats not true, Judy, and you know it.Hes angry, and hes in and out.
There is this place, the Parker Home.Its midway between us, in New Brunswick.
And what happens there?
He lives there.Its got everything, plus doctors.
Its expensive, but I thoughtmaybe we could sell our house.
You know.That would give him enough to live on.
Thats very generous.
- Do you think he belongs in a home?- Betty, I know I dont get a vote.
- Neither does Don.- All you care about is the house.
You want to walk in there,see Daddy on the bottom of the stairs,
and have his last words be,"Take the house."
Fine, Betts. Whats the solution?
Those homes are for peoplewho dont have families, William.
- Hes a lonely old man and hes not well.- Hes your father.
- Gene.- Thanks for the ritzy accommodations.
Youre an army man, Gene.Drop your socks and grab something.
Lights out at 8: 15. Im impressed.
I wish you would hang your coat updownstairs. Its covered with soot.
- How bad is he?- Hes not the problem.
What am I saying? Hes the whole problem.That, and Williams never-ending bullshit.
- What now?- He wants to put him in an old folks home.
Well, I understand its not ideal,but it is the next logical step.
Don, he just wants the house.
He keeps nailing himself to the cross.For all I know, Judys pushing him.
Cut it out!
What do you want to do?
How can he talk that way to mein the condition Im in?
- Do you want anything?- Just throw it on the chair and stay here.
Be careful.
Im fine.
Its so funny how she is.My father and her fought constantly.
She never remembers that part.
- Family is important to her.- I care about family.
You know, Don had nobodyat their wedding. Nobody at all.
Why cant we just move in with him?Ill take care of him.
Its bad enough to work for him.Im a 30-year-old man.
I dont want to have somebody tell meI have the wrong tie on.
Raffit is sending over every piece of paperthey have on the new Garden.
He wants you to see these new drawings.Apparently theyre right out of Metropolis.
- He talk about television?- I have a meeting on the books.
He talked a lot about radio. And Kinsey.
Youre gonna haveto keep a low profile on this,
- but it doesnt mean youre not working.- Mr. Pryce is here to see you.


I didnt realizeyou were in the middle of something.
Did you come to treat usto a little new-business lunch?
May I speak with you in private, Don?
- Can I get you anything?- No, thank you.
Bad news, Im afraid.I just got off the phone with London.
Theres a problemwith Madison Square Garden.
- Did their check bounce already?- Unfortunately, theres a conflict.
Did you tell them its a stadiumin the middle of New York City?
- Its one of a kind.- They know exactly what it is, a project,
and they told us to turn it down.
- Im confused.- Its a question of economics.
Servicing Madison Square Gardenwill require an account man,
at least two copywriters, two artists,
an ombudsman for City Hall,all against 200,000 in billings.
Thats for right now.
Precisely. From what I understand,groundbreaking is at least two years away.
Madison Square Gardenis our way into the Worlds Fair,
the largest trade show in history.
Plus, theres the Garden itself.Hotels, concerts, sports.
- This could mean 30 years of business.- Theyre not interested. Im sorry.
You told me to go out and get this account.I did. I did my job,
and now youre telling meits all for nothing
because you forgot to check withyour boss first? Whos running this place?
I know this is difficult.I take full responsibility.
Why the hell did you buy usin the first place?
I dont know.
Tell Mr. CampbellMadison Square Garden is dead.
- Do you have a second?- Can it wait?
No.
Sal sent up the storyboards.
- What is this?- Its Patio, the diet drink for Pepsi.
Yes. Everyone wants a drinkthat sounds like a floor.
This is Chinese.
Its all one sh*t,like the beginning of Bye Bye Birdie.
- I havent seen it.- Well, this is an Ann-Margret type.
Fine.
You really havent seen it?You see everything.
We have a few versions of a song,
and the boys are very excitedabout finding this girl.
Im sure.
Dont you find her voice shrill?
Shes throwing herself at the camera.Its pure.
It makes your heart hurt.
No one seems to care that it speaks to men,not the people that drink diet drinks.
What do the geniuses at Patio want?
Maybe we should be talking about howthis is better than coffee or Dexedrine.
Its not about making women feel fat.
This is, "Look how happy I amthat I drink Patio.
"Im young and excitedand desperate for a man."
I dont mind fantasies,but shouldnt it be a female one?
Peggy, I know you understandhow this works.
Men want her. Women want to be her.
- Even if thats true...- It is.
Im sorry if that makes you uncomfortable.
Well, you know,if we were making a movie or a play,
wed be embarrassed to do this. Its phony.
Youre not an artist, Peggy.You solve problems.
Leave some tools in your toolbox.
Could you hold that?
- Heading home?- Yes.
Let me ask you something.Youre a young girl.
Excuse me?
Youre the only one around here whodoesnt have that stupid look on her face.
What does that mean?
What would your father have to dofor you to not want him at your wedding?
- My father passed away.- There you go. Youd do anything.
Hello.
Its so crowded in here,I feel like Im on the subway.
Wheres your drink?
Don. Dont worry about this.Its under control.
- Hey, wheres Mom?- Shes upstairs.
- Im going out for a bucket of chicken.- Whats the matter?
- Im a horrible daughter.- No, youre not.
William says these are the options.We put him in a home,
or they move in with himand Judy is his nurse. Judy.
William says?
Hes probably right.
- William!- Yeah, Don?
Go get the chicken in a minute.
Can I speak to you a minute?
- Jesus. What year is this from?- I dont care.
Look, Don, were all upset.
One thing Ive learned from this,dont get old.
- About your father...- Mans a real jackpot.
He always said he didnt wantto be a burden, yet here we are.
This is whats going to happen.
Youre gonna explain to your sisterand your wife
that we have reached an understanding.
You are going to supportyour father financially,
and I am going to take him into my house.His house will remain untouched.
I appreciate the advice, Don.Ill take it under consideration.
Youre gonna go out thereand youre gonna tell your sister
that this is what you want.
Well pretend that you did the right thingon your own.
- Hes my father!- And hes in my home.
I want you to leave tonight,and I want you to leave the Lincoln.
- I cant have him here without a car.- Are you kidding me?
How are we supposed to get home?
New York Central.Broadway Limited from Penn Station.
It leaves in two hours.
You want him? You got him.
- Dad, we have to talk.- I could eat.
No. Daddy, William has something to say.
All of us, weve been trying to figure outa way we can help you live better.
Id be doing all right if people left me alone.
Daddy,
- Don and I want you to live here with us.- Elizabeth.
Honey, Im not that blue.
Just for a while.I think you need a little vacation.
So the animals are running the zoo?
Were not selling the house,and youre gonna have your car.
The plans, the plans, the plans you make.
You know you want to get out of town.Youll be with the kids.
Betty is a better cook. You always say that.
- Well, I shouldve been the first to go.- Daddy, dont talk like that.
We should go pack.Girls, start getting your things together.
Its nice, right? Its called a stinger.
- I dont know whats in it.- Its delicious.
Im graduating from Brooklyn Collegenext month.
- What are you studying?- What?
- What are you studying?- Do you want one?
- Im afraid youre gonna bite my hand.- Im sorry.
I just need to eat.My mom says Im still growing.
I gotta work on my manners.
I started pre-law,but switched to engineering. More jobs.
Really? Those are so different.
Youve gotta figure,if were all gonna be replaced by machines,
might as well be a guythat makes them, right?
Or you could just become a robot.
- Are you in school?- I work at an ad agency, Manhattan.
Wow. I dont know how you girlsdo all that typing.
- And I work for a jerk.- Were hitting the road. You got cab fare?
What are you talking about?I live around the corner.
Thats right. He does.
Youre funny.
Do you have... You know.
- What?- A Trojan?
No.
I cant.
Jeez. Its getting pretty late.
Well,
there are other things we could do.
Did you hear that?
Gene.
The heat is on.We got to get rid of this stuff.
You got anything else around, go flush it.
- Youre leaving?- I have to work tomorrow.
- You want to get breakfast?- Its the middle of the night.
- Where do you work again?- Madison Avenue.
Right.
Well, you know,I hang out at that place a lot.
Okay.
Its the bottom one.
Thanks.
This was fun.
Parents, friends, and family,Id like to welcome you all to field day.
I hope you can appreciatehow hard the children have prepared
in all kinds of weather.
Scott?
"The tradition of the maypoledates back over 500 years,
"and is celebrated all over the world.
"We erected our maypolefor Ossinings sesquicentennial.
"We dance around the polein a timeless celebration
"of the renewal of springtime."
Okay, ribbons up.
- Daddy! Did you see me dance?- I did. You were great.
Hey. Hey, Drapers.
Cindys dad wants to take our picture.
Say, "Cheese!"
- Cheese!- Cheese!
- How was your morning, Mr. Draper?- Fine.
- Do you want to talk about Pampers?- What do you got?
