Lee, Lee,Don doesnt think theres a problem.
Lee, those restrictionsarent going to affect Lucky Strike.
Besides, Lee,your lawyers came up with them.
"No more smoking teenagers,"we complied a year ago.
"No more famous athletes"
and we have to stop using certain angles.
Low angles, wide lenses,
anything that makes the smokerappear superhuman.
Why is this empty?
Because you drank it all.
-He cant hear you.-Theres kind of a loophole
because even without athletesyou can still use sports.
Bowling, for example, seems a natural Ht.
Bowling is a sport, Lee.
How about horse-racing?
Lee, Lee, the jockey smokes the cigarette.
Did either of you ladiesbring any ice with you?
Were sorting out the focus group for Pondsand I havent gotten the hypothesis,
in writing anyway.
He said, "Don."
Well do our best. Peggy, write it up.
You havent okayed the brief.
I liked your idea. I liked it a lot.
The mirror one or the cleansing one?
Whats the mirror one?
Well, I think its about the ritual,the multiple applications, indulgence.
Ponds is the only cold cream that allows me
to stare at myself in the mirrorfor 20 minutes
and feel good and not vain.
Thats very good.
So, were talking about girls, 18 to 25.
Can I grab a few from around here?
Yeah, help yourself.
See, I would never buy a sailboat.
I dont want to do things myself.
For that price,that boat should have a motor.
A what?
-One of those, too.-Anything else?
I dont know.Why dont you ask Don about that?
I have to go to the little boys room.
Im sorry, Lee,can you go through that one more time?
Thats the Lucky Strike call?Why wasnt I told?
Be happy. I saved you an ass-ache.
So whats so bad he couldnt tell me?
Cal Rutledge from Chesebrough-Pondshas a wild hair about Clearasil.
He thinks theyre in conflict.
Pimple cream and cold cream?
A rather broad definition.
Does it matter?
Look, Pete, were going to haveto resign the Clearasil account.
-Why?-Lane.
It cant be up for debate.
Clearasil is worth $1.25 million in billings,and Ponds over two.
No.
You know what it tookto get my father-in-law
to join this new firm to begin with?
Fifteen percent of $750,000 is near $113,000.
Roger, I dont expect himto understand this,
but do you have any ideaof what Ive had to do to keep that account?
The personal toll Ive paid?
I do, but youve been good to him,remember that, sales-wise.
-Mr. Sterling?-I dont believe this.
-Roger.-Throw yourself on a grenade.
Protect the agency. Youre a partner now.
This evening if you can.
Over half this agencyis dedicated to your needs,
but if you want to get into the line-by-line
of the costs weve billed for,
Ill have Lane Pryceat the foot of your bed in 20 minutes.
Oh, my God, theres some kind of fire.
Right down by Radio City.
Roger, we should go. Sorry, Lee.
We gotta go. Okay, bye-bye.
Should I type all this up?
Yes. And remind meto remind Caroline to tell Lane
that Lucky Strike noticedthat theyre being billed
for all the work we dofor everybody else at this agency.
You know what? I dont want that on paper.
-Who is that?-A dear friend.
Is that the letter from California?
Yes.
-I hate this office.-You wanted to be close to Roger.
Make yourself at home, why dont you?
Did you see Sundays paper?
If this is about the Playtex adthey keep complaining about,
Ive been toldthe printer swapped paper stocks.
And I dont careif she looks like a Puerto Rican.
Puerto Rican girls buy brassieres.
Not that they need to.
I saw this one on the subwayin one of those striped Jean Seberg shirts,
red rag in her hair, nipples...
Im not in the mood. What do you want?
-Cosgroves getting married.-So?
He took us to the opera last month,great seats, and now I know why.
It turns out her father shits gold ingots.
What does he do?
CFO of Corning.
My father-in-laws a bus driver.
The only place he can take meis to the moon.
Kens the competition.Why are you going to the opera with him?
Geyer is twice our size,and were friends, arent we?
Friends.
Why are you always looking for a job?
What?
Look, Pete.
Theres a group of us,were all coming up together.
You dont think Kennys a comer?
You know he has Mountain Dew?Thats Pepsi.
Were having lunch tomorrow. Tag along.He always asks about you.
Of course he does.
Worst case, Kennyll brag too muchand you can steal a client from him.
Hello.
Im sorry. That looks like bad news.
Its not mine. Im Joyce.I work at Life, assistant photo editor.
Peggy Olson, Sterling CooperDraper Pryce, copywriter.
Really?
Life magazine, I love the photos.
Well, youll never see these.
I have to admit Id be shocked.
Hes my friend, and my boss hates nudes.
Who hates nudes?
Thats a beautiful one.
Im going to the mailroom.Peggy, right? 37th floor?
Tom, youre 15 minutes early.
So are you. Sit down.
We can eat anytime or not at all.
Excuse me. Dewars on the rocks.
Whats so important?
Tom, how are you feeling?
Couldnt be better.
I hope you know Ive always done my bestto make you happy.
I do.
And theres no reason,as far as Im concerned,
that there should be any change in the waythat we deal with each other.
Tom, I...
This is very hard for me to say.
I honestly dont know howyoure going to take this
and its been very hard to separate
our business relationshipfrom the rest of our life,
but they should be separate.
You are some kind of high WASP, all right.
-Look, I cant keep this up.-Keep what up?
I heard.
You know?
You crazy kid.
What are you talking about?
Jeannie was with Trudy at the doctor.Congratulations!
What?
Oh, shit.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
It was Monday, for crying out loud.Why hasnt she told you?
I dont know.
Well, it may be her news,but it is good news.
You cant tell her that I told you. You cant.
Im going to be a father?
Can you believe it?
-Im going to be a father.-Yeah.
I feel like my hearts going to burst.
Champagne right here. Bring a bottle.Were going to tie one on.
If its a boy, its $1 ,000, a girl, $500.
Ill do what I can do.
You really cant tell Trudy.
I dont know howl let the cat out of the bag.
I thought you knewwhat I was talking about.
-What did you think I was talking about?-What?
Why did you have to see me?
I just wanted to...
Were putting new creative on Clearasil.
Fine. Who cares?
May you know this feeling many times.
I only had the one,
and I love her to death,but I wish wed had more.
Jeannie had her uterus removed,some kind of a cyst or something.
Trudy!
Im sick, Peter. Im so sick about this.
Daddy just called me from a pay phone,drunk and in tears.
I know what you think. I just wanted to waittill our anniversary to tell you.
I dont care, Trudy.
I dont care how I heard.
Peter.
How did this happen?What did the doctor say?
He said I was going to have a baby.
I want to pick you up and spin you around,
but I dont wantto damage anything in there.
Im so happy youre happy.
I dont know.It feels much different than I expected.
How would you know what this feels like?
Come, get off your feet.
How are you feeling?
Tell me youll forgive my father.
They already think you hate themand honestly, its my fault.
I dont hate them.
I shouldnt have taken my motherto the doctor, not that doctor.
Its just...I thought something was going on,
and I was so prepared to be disappointed
or that, God forbid,something was really wrong.
Trudy, I had to talk to himbecause the agency has to drop Clearasil.
-Why?-Theres another product thats similar,
-and we cant...-A conflict.
Peter, Im familiar with the term.You use it all the time.
I invited him thereand his good news trumped my bad news.
And the funny thing is,that was the moment to tell him.
I was so bowled over.
We did it.
Why dont youlet my father hear this from me?
Hes already so guilty,hell never feel the kn*fe go in.
I cant let you do that.
But Im the one who talked himinto returning to the agency to begin with.
-We needed him.-And now you dont.
Hell be fine. Tomorrow night.
Yankee pot roast.
Lets go.Caroline will be watching your desk.
Why dont you have to do this?
You dont have to do this.Youre getting paid.
Were old and were married.They dont want us.
But I use Ponds. I do.
Come on.
Girls, rind your places.Megan, help me with the curtains.
No matter how late I come,Im always waiting for someone.
I had to wait until the girlsleft the ladies room to change.
You couldve used my office,but I dont have one.
-This isnt right.-I thought you wanted Faye, not Dr. Miller.
Yes, but I told someoneto leave the "e" off of Faye.
I like to be able to correct it in frontof the girls. It makes them trust me.
Because your name is spelled wrong?
Because Im obviously not that important.I dont need it.
I have to warn you theres lots of perfume.
There always is.
...why everyone has a nifty name tag.
Very well then.I suppose Ill work in Mr. Sterlings office.
He wont be coming.
As I said, my name is Faye.
I dont have a name tag.
I guess they forgot about me.
They got mine wrong. Im Dotty.
I mean Im not a dotty person.Thats my name.
Hello, Dotty.
So, theres no reason to be anxious.
We have to enjoy the fact that were allgetting paid not to work for a little bit.
But dont worry, thats our little secret.
And Id like you to think that this isjust a bunch of your friends,
as if maybe this is a sororityor a bridal shower with tea.
Or just a bunch of us celebrating, sayAllison s birthday at my apartment.
You shouldnt be surprised,looking around the room,
that were here to talk about beauty.
What are the things we all doto keep ourselves beautiful
or simply to enhance it?
Please pass a Danish.
You dont have to raise your hand. Anyone?
I can say it.
I have a routine.
I brush my hair 100 timesjust like I did when I was a little girl,
but of course only the nightbefore I have it set.
-Very cute.-Can you imagine?
Your financial futures in the handsof a roomful of 22-year-old girls.
Not mine.
Okay. Sometimes I watch my weight.
No ones hungry?
Id like a Danish.
I dont use Ponds,if thats what youre asking.
Thats okay.
Im of French extractionand my mother has beautiful skin.
She never washes her face.
Shes not dirty.She uses water, but nothing else.
And you do what she does?
What does she do?
She stands at the sink
and she runs the water until itsjust the perfect temperature, not too hot.
And she splashes it on her faceand she pats her cheeks with her fingertips.
And she looks at herself?
Yes, she does.
Shes amazing.
I sit at my vanity and I have this night cream,my boyfriend laughed at me.
What was so funny about it?
It was just, you know, one time.
At Christmas Eve we were staying up lateand we were playing house, I guess.
You shouldnt do things for them.They dont appreciate it.
You dont thinkthey appreciate you being beautiful?
We broke up a year ago.
Actually, I dont know what he noticed,but it wasnt me, I guess.
Its worse when they notice, sometimes.
Allison, please, continue.
Its nothing.
-Are you in there?-Yes.
I asked your girl to inform me of your arrival.
Shes in that group.
Did you speak with Tom?
Im sorry. It didnt happen.The opportunity passed.
Well, then we shall endeavor to recreate it.Perhaps lunch today?
Im afraid Rogers already informed Pondsthat this was attended to.
Thats sloppy.
I have a lunch, but Im seeing him tonight.
Damn it.
Lane.
I just found out Im going to be a father.
Well, now, that shouldtake the sting out of all of this.
I suppose.
I apologize.
Thats the very best news.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
And I just kept thinking,"Why does he stare at other girls?"
Well, men do that,but does he look at me that way?
And were not married, so who am I?
How the hell did this get so sad so fast?
I know Im speaking for everyone here.
But you cant think it has anything to dowith how you look, Dotty.
You can only do your bestwith what God gave you.
What about makeup?
I feel like it doesnt matter what I see.
It matters what he sees.
I feel like I gave him everythingand I got nothing.
I could see she was gonna crack.
Allison?
Are you all right, dear?
-Its okay. Shell be all right.-Should I...
If she wanted to be around us,she wouldve stayed.
Sarah, what do you do that makes you feelgood about the way you look?
I feel kind of responsible. Do you mind?
Is there any kind of ritual?
I think my strategy was right.
They just wanna get marriedand theyll buy anything thatll help.
-Are you all right?-its you.
Come with me.
People cry in these things all the time.Grown men.
I was in a bunchwhen I first started working here.
Id say half the time somebody cries.
Really?
I think it just feels good to talk.
I cant even say anythingbecause I know hes right out there,
right through the glass.
Who?
I dont know how you stand it.
The way he turns on the charm one minuteand then yanks it away.
How can you even talk to him?
Don?
Would you stop it?
I realize you mustve gone througheverything Ive gone through.
But now I know. Its just, hes a drunk.
And they get away with m*rderbecause they forget everything.
I dont know what you think.
Forget it.
Your problem is not my problem.
-Fine.-And honestly, you should get over it.
Please leave me alone.
-Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.-Nice to meet you.
-Bye.-Bye.
-Did she go home?-No, shes fine.
Nothing else good happened.
-Bye, now.-Okay, great.
Bye-bye.
That went very well.
You can stop the tape.
Is she okay?
-Who?-Yeah, shes fine.
All right. Lets talk preliminary results.
Is it all rightif we put this back the way it goes?
We can go to my office.
Lets go in there.
Thats big, big news.
If you need any baby crap,Jen and I have a closetful.
-Hello, fellows.-Good to see you, Kenny.
-Pete.-How are you, Ken?
-Mr. Crane.-Over here, Gil.
Theres a phone call for you.
Ive gotta get this. Those goniffsat CBS are screwing me again.
-Those what?-Order for me, Caesar salad, no dressing.
-You wanna take a look?-Sure.
Listen, Ive gotta get this out of the way.
But I would appreciate it for the future
if you would not say shitty thingsabout me behind my back.
What?
Come on.Are you gonna deny it and make it worse?
I dont know what youve heard,but its not true.
You didnt call me an All-American idiotwho fell into everything?
Whom did I supposedly say this to?
Does it matter?
Well, Id like to defend myself.
I heard that you told your wifethat I was driving the tractor
when the accident happened.
What? I dont think so.
What I probably said wasthat you were involved,
we all were, and that it was your account.
And Crane told me yesterdayyou said I was marrying for money.
I didnt say that. He did.
Well, hes like that,and everybody who knows him knows that.
But when you say it, and especiallywhen it gets back to my fiancee,
Trudy knows her, you know,some garden club.
I was unaware of that.
Look, you know what?
I apologize. Mea culpa.
Textbook Harry.
You know what? Hes buying lunch.
I dont really care.Im just glad to be out of the office.
It is nice, especially without having to listen
to some client yammeringabout how dirty the city is.
Hows it going?
Ive been floating along laterally,but I dont know that its a love affair.
-Its better than McCann.-What was that like?
Are you kidding me? its the worst agencyIve ever seen. The worst.
My mother was a nurseat the state hospital in Vermont
and that was the last time I sawso many retarded people in one building.
So, youre getting married. Congratulations.
Its all that really matters, right?
Actually, I have a bit of news of my own.
Trudy is with child.
Good for you. Good for you.
Ill be honest, I cant wait.
Its very good so far.
A new family, a new agency,has to be exciting.
Well, you know, wherever you do this job,youre doing this job.
I know youre all slaves to Draper over there,
but Id rather be a slave to creativethan some old fart.
Whoever pours the last drinkgets all the credit
and youre spinning your wheelshalf the time.
Right now were chasing Mountain Dew.
Supposedly were goingto turn it into Pepsi,
but the only reason Pepsi would do itis to make BBDO sweat.
This whole idea thatwed get the bigger company is a joke.
Wed just end upwith a bunch of little pieces.
Well, the grass is always greener.
Who am I kidding? Look how lucky we are.
Another Campbell,thats just what the world needs.
-Can I come in?-Its your office.
Glad to see youre feeling better.
If you dont feel like working...
What?
Im very embarrassed.
People cry in those groupsall the time, Allison.
Thats not what Im embarrassed about.
This actually happened.
I know.
I know.
We made a mistake
and I feel like its awkwardand its better for both of us if I move on.
I dont think thats necessary.Were both adults.
No, I really would feel better about it.
A friend of mine told meabout a job at a magazine
and I thought that might be interesting,working for a woman.
Anyway, I...
I would appreciate itif you could write me a recommendation.
Absolutely.What would probably be even better
is if you type up whatever you wantand Ill sign it.
What?


Youve been sparkling in your duties.
Just put it on my stationery,put whatever you want and Ill sign it.
I dont say this easily,but youre not a good person.
Allison, hold on.
Whats going on?
Im gonna need a new secretary.And this cleaned up.
Would you be opento Allison returning in a couple of days?
-If thats what she wants.-Really?
No.
Theres a Joyce Ramsayto see you at reception.
So, at this pointyouve read everything out here?
I dont even like magazines,
but I brought in a bookand they told me it didnt look right.
Hi.
Do you wantto come back and see my office?
Another time.
Listen, my friend the photographer,Mr. Reject, hes having a...
I dont even know what to call it, downtown.
Are you inviting me?
-Are you afraid of the subway?-Of course not.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Washington Market,
unless you have to workor have plans that are more interesting.
It starts at 9:00. Ill be there at 10:00.
Shes kind of pretentious.
I know.
Darling, were so excited.
Is that you, Peter?
Im gonna keep my mouth shut from now on.
Well, hello there.
-How are you feeling?-A little behind.
Why dont you let mefix my father and you a drink
and you can show my motherwhat we have planned for the maids room.
Ill make the drinks. I dont care.
No, why dont you showyour mother the maids room?
I dont know that Im an expert.
Okay.
Come along, Mother.
Were a couple of lucky ducks, arent we?
We are. Tom, let me ask you something.
-What are you having?-In a minute. Listen...
I know what youre gonna say.
You need a bigger apartment. I get it.
Every time you jump to conclusions,Tom, you make me respect you less.
-What?-LOOK.
You gave us Clearasiland were extremely grateful,
but theres only so much businessits going to do.
Yeah, well, thats kind of in your hands,isnt it?
Im done auditioning.
You gave us this under a certain pretext.
Ive done well by you.
And the idea wasif we do well by this account,
youll give us a sh*t at the big one,
because right nowI have bigger business than Clearasil.
Are you mad at me?
No.
Clearasil was conflicted outby a bigger company,
and Im trying to build a business here.
Well, what do you want?Do you want the cough syrup?
I want all of it.
I want the formula 44 mixture,the cough drops, the inhaler, vaporub.
Whos doing a better jobfor you than I have?
Well, youve given mesomething to think about.
Really?
I think its pretty simple. What can I get you?
Trudy, do we have any ice?
You son of a bitch.
Tom, you have to come see this.
Joyce!
I made it.
You look swellegant.
Okay.
Peggy works in the same building.
Sharon was one of Daveys models.
What did your mother say?
She doesnt know.
What is that?
He screws around with movies, too.Hes not as good at it.
I cant believe how big this place is.
I think it was a sweatshop.
Is there beer or something?I thought I saw someone with a beer.
Jesus. I thought I needed a lot of attention.
Listen, Im already high,but this is easier than finding a beer.
If you like it.
I love it.
Im hungry.
I have a boyfriend.
He doesnt own your vagina.
No, but hes renting it.
This film is more interesting than I thought.
-its rhythmic.-Yeah.
I thought I was gonna get to meet him.
Abe!
Where the hells Kellogg?
Hey, Abe. Are you with Joyce?
Are you?
-Im Peggy.-Peggys a writer.
So am I. What do you write?
Im a Copywriter.
But what do you write?
That is writing.
Youre not working on something else?
Davey Kellogg, this is Peggy Olson.
-She wanted to meet you.-Im Catholic.
So, you like it?
I dont think Im supposed to.
I love your nudes.Were looking for photographers.
-Im glad I was here to see this.-Whos "we"?
I work at Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.Advertising.
Why would I ever do that?
So you can get paid to practice your art.
Art in advertising?
Why would anyone do that after Warhol?
Sorry, for somebody to sell their soul,theyve got to have one.
Its a raid!
Its the NYPD.
Wait, wait.
-Hey, come on. Come on.-Nobody move!
You know, Ive been arrested before.
For what?
I was writing about this boycott in Harlemand they wouldnt leave, so I didnt leave.
Wow! Did you go to jail?
No.
My sister came and got me.
I feel like I should kiss you.
Come on.
They chased everybodydown the fire escape.
Are they b*at people?
They took the film.
I should see this. It could be a story.
-How can I find you?-I know where she is.
Nice to see you, Ms. Blankenship.
I look forward to hearing that every day.
Theres coffee and a roll on your deskand Mr. Sterling would like to see you.
Roger, hes here.
Could you get the others?
Blankenship? Boy!
Hello? Could you fetch Campbelland Pryce, Lane, Misters.
What did you doto make them take her out of mothballs?
She was working in Coopers apartment.
Allison found a better opportunity.
Do you know he works without pants?
-Morning, Don.-Don.
Morning.
Id like to sayin front of this informal partners meeting
that I am in the midst of signingVicks Chemical, the entire cough line.
It bills at around $6 millionand they love television.
Its truly spectacular news.
Congratulations. Howd you swing that?
I guess as the president would say,I turned chicken shit into chicken salad.
I thought Id kick Clearasil over to Geyer.
Anyone but Chaough.
Were taking Philip Coakmeyerand Tom Vogel to luncheon today.
Dont worry,we already checked it with your girl.
-Keep it up.-Thank you, Don.
Please reschedule Dr. Miller.
Theyre not really pornography, per se.Theyre just nudes.
Theyre like renaissance paintings.
The party sounds fun.We had nude models in school.
You know right away whoeverhas the best drawing is going to get her.
Did you know Malcolm Xwas sh*t last Sunday?
Yes, Peggy.
Well, did you know who he was?
You ever read the stuff between the ads?
A few of us are sendinga bottle of champagne to the Campbells.
Ill sign the card.
-I was hoping for a contribution.-No, thank you.
Trudys pregnant?
I cant believe that guys married to her.
I would get her so pregnant.
Hello.
Congratulations.
Yes.
A $6 million accountshould shut Lane up for a while.
No, I mean about the baby.
Yes. I guess thats news.
I just wanted to let you knowhow happy I am for you both.
Thank you.
Dr. Miller is here to see you. Its a she.
Send her in.
-What do you want?-Nothing. I moved the meeting.
Your secretary saidyou needed to see me immediately.
Were still working things out.
Well, Ive done everythingbut finish the report.
Howd we do?
Well, it turns outthe hypothesis was rejected.
Id recommend a strategy that linksPonds Cold Cream to matrimony,
a veiled promise.
Hello, 1925.
Im not gonna do that,so what are we gonna tell the client?
I cant change the truth.
How do you know thats the truth?
A new idea is somethingthey dont know yet,
so of course its not gonnacome up as an option.
Put my campaign on IV for a year,
then hold your group again,maybe itll show up.
Well, I tried everything.I said, "Routine." I tried "ritual."
All they care about is a husband.
You were there.Ill show you the transcripts.
You cant tellhow people are going to behave
based on how they have behaved.
Why are you being so hostile?
You think Ive never hadthis argument before?
Because you go in thereand you stick your finger in peoples brains
and they just start talking...Just to be heard.
And you know what?
Not only does it have nothing to dowith what I do, but its nobodys business.
Well, youre the client.
Thats right.
-Hello.-Its Joyce.
Lunch, five minutes.
Sure.
-Meet you in the lobby?-No, my friends want to see Megan.
-Pete, you remember Phil Coakmeyer.-A pleasure to see you again.
Shall we?
Were just waiting on Don.
Hi.
-You wanna join us?-I cant.
Did you get pears?
Did you get pears?
Did you get pears?
Well discuss it inside.
