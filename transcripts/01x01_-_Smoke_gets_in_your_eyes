Old Gold man, huh?
Lucky Strike here.
Can I ask you a question?Why do you smoke Old Gold?
Im sorry, sir.Is Sam here bothering you?
He can bea little chatty.
No, were actually justhaving a conversation.
Is that okay?
Can I get youanother drink?
Yeah. Do this again.
Old-fashioned, please.
So you obviously need to relaxafter working here all night.
I guess.I dont know.
But what is it?I mean, low-tar?
Those new filters?Why, I mean, why Old Gold?
They gave em to usin the service...
a carton a weekfor free.
So youre used to em,is that it?
Yeah.
Theyre a habit.
I could never get youto try another brand...
say, my Luckies?
I love my Old Golds.
All right, well,lets just say tomorrow
a tobacco weevil comesand eats every last
Old Gold on the planet.
Thats a sad story.
Its a tragedy.
Would youjust stop smoking?
I think I couldfind something.
I love smoking.
"I love smoking. "Thats very good.
My wife hates it.
Readers Digestsays it will k*ll you.
Yeah,I heard about that.
Ladies lovetheir magazines.
Yes, they do.
You werent worriedabout waking me, were you?
Am I interrupting anything?
Mmm, no.
Youre luckyIm still up working
and Im all alone.
Hows it going?
They inventedsomething called
Grandmothers Day.
That ought to keep mebusy drawing puppies
for a few months.
Can I run a few ideaspast you?
Does that mean what I think it means?
Because Im familiarwith most of your ideas.
Im having a situationwith my cigarette account.
You really are hereto talk.
The Trade Commissionis cracking down
on all of our health claims.
I get Readers Digest.
This is the same scareyou had five years ago.
You dealt with it.
I knowI slept a lot better,
knowing doctors smoke.
Well, thats just it.
The whole "safer cigarette"thing is over.
No more doctors,no more testimonials,
no more cough-free,soothes your T-zone,
low-tar, low-nicotine,filter tip.
Nothing.
All I haveis a crush-proof box
and "four out of fivedead people smoke your brand. "
Is this the partwhere I say,
"Don Draperis the greatest
ad man ever,"and his big, strong brain
will find a wayto lead the sheep
to the slaughterhouse"?
I dont want to goto school tomorrow.
You gonna pitch to meor not?
Midge, Im serious.I have nothing.
I am over, and theyrefinally gonna know it.
Next time you see me,
therell be a bunch of young executivespicking meat off my ribs.
Thats a pretty picture.
Whats your secret?
Nine different waysto say...
"I love you, Grandma. "
We should get married.
You think Id makea good ex-wife?
Im serious.
You have your own business.
You dont mindwhen I come over.
What size Cadillacdo you take?
You know the rules.
I dont make plans,and I dont make
breakfast.
Sterlings havingthe tobacco people in
in nine hours,and I have nothing.
People love smoking.
Theres nothing that you,the Trade Commission,
or Readers Digestcan do to change that.
Theres this kid who comesby my office every day,
looks where hes gonnaput his plants.
Is he handsome?
  .
Uh, not right away.
Pal, could you take the long way up?
I am really enjoyingthe view here.
You going to Campbellsbachelor party?
Yeah, I want to be therebefore they tie
an anchor around his neckand drag him out to sea.
I hearshes a nice girl.
Eh,who wants that?
What did you do that for?
Shell probably beassigned to one of us.
Then shell knowwhat shes in for.
You got to let them knowwhat kind of guy you are.
Then theyll knowwhat kind of girl to be.
I have a feeling we wont be goingto your bachelor party soon.
Yeah, well, compared to Campbell,Im a Boy Scout.
Excuse me.Is he expecting you?
Hes not expecting anything.
Oh, honey, dont worry.Ill get home safely.
I have an importantappointment right now,
so why dont you goshopping or something?
Take your mother to lunch.
Tell her it was my idea.
Wow. Hes good.
Its justa bachelor party, dear.
No, I really dont knowwhat they have planned,
but judging fromthe creative brain power around here,
well probably end upseeing My Fair Lady.
Ill tell you what.
Ill drop by your placeon my way home.
Your mother can checkunder my fingernails.
Of course I love you.
Im giving up my lifeto be with you, arent I?
What a great gal.
I tell ya, boys,she stole my heart.
And her old mansloaded.
Now, this isthe executive floor.
It should be organized,but its not,
so youll findaccount executives
and creative executivesall mixed in together.
- Please dont ask me the difference.- Great.
Hopefully, if you follow my lead,you can avoid some of the mistakes
Ive made here.
- Hello, Joan.- Like that one.
- So how many trains did it take you?- Only one, but I got up very early.
In a couple of years,with the right moves,
youll be in the citywith the rest of us.
Of course,if you really make the right moves,
youll be out in the country,and you wont be going to work at all.
Youll be herejust across the aisle from me.
Well both take care of Mr. Draperfor the time being.
I dont know what your goals are,
but dont overdo it with the perfume.
Keep a fifth of somethingin your desk.
Mr. Draper drinks dry.
Also, invest in someaspirin, Band-Aids,
and a needle and thread.
Rye is Canadian, right?
You better find out.
He may act likehe wants a secretary,
but most of the time,theyre looking for something
between a mother and a waitress.
And the restof the time, well...
Go home,take a paper bag,
and cut some eyeholesout of it.
Put it over your head,get undressed,
and look at yourselfin the mirror.
Really evaluatewhere your strengths
and weaknesses are,and be honest.
I always try to be honest.
Good for you.
Now, try not to be overwhelmedby all this technology.
It looks complicated,
but the men who designed it made itsimple enough for a woman to use.
I sure hope so.
At lunch, pick upa box of chocolates,
a dozen carnations,and some bath salts.
- Ill explain later.- Thank you, Miss Holloway.
Youre really wonderful for looking outfor me this way.
Its Joan.
And listen,dont take this
the wrong way,but a girl like you,
with those darlinglittle ankles,
Id find a wayto make em sing.
Also, men love scarves.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Oh! And Mr. Sterling.
How are you?
Morning, girls.
You look like a hundred bucks.Long night?
Its not thistobacco thing, is it?
Its been on my mind.
Yeah, well,I should hope so.
Lee Garner, his father,the whole Lucky Strike family
will be here at  .
You worried?
No.
If I was worried,Id ask you what youve got,
but Im not, so Im just going to assumeyouve got something,
which means you should be worried.
So you came here because you wantedto watch me get dressed?
No, I wanted to make sureyou were here.
In body. Give meabout a half hour
for the rest of it.
Oh.
How do I put this?
Have weever hired any Jews?
Not on my watch.
Thats very funny.Its not what I meant.
Weve got an Italian.
Salvatore, my art director.
That wont work.Sorry.
Most of the Jewish guyswork for the Jewish firms.
Yeah, I know.
Selling Jewish productsto Jewish people.
Thats very good.
Its just that our   :is with Menkens Department Store
and I wish we had someone to make themfeel... comfortable.
Want me to run to the deliand grab somebody?
You missed a button.
Ah. Look at you, Gidget.
Still tryingto fill out that bikini?
Summers coming.
Without the medical claims,all we have is a white box
with a red spot on it.
My neighbor posed for that.
Believe me, he alwayslooks very relaxed.
Of course,he doesnt smoke.
Had him hold a pencil.
If I know these guys, youre better offwith a little sex appeal.
Can you give me a womanin a bathing suit,
put her next to your guy?
A sexy girl?
I can do that.
Give you a chance to get a real model.
Oh, I love my work.
Speaking of sexy girls,are you going to Petes
bachelor party?
Im not really bigon those things.
Tell me about it.
Its so embarrassing.
If a girls gonna shake it in my face,
I want to be aloneso I can do something.
Should we drink beforethe meeting or after?
Or both?
So... thats it, huh?
Relax?
Dont be short with me.
Youre the writer.
I thoughtit was worth a try.
Greta Guttmanis here to see you.
- Send her in.- Oh, great.
Now we get to hear fromour man in research.
Mr. Draper, Mr. Romano,you both seemed more relaxed
than I expected.
Do you have some kind of surprisefor the tobacco people?
Im doingmy own research.
If youre planning to continue withmedical testimony,
youll only be invitingfurther government interference.
We must police ourselves.
- Theres your slogan.- The medical thing is dead.
- We understand that.- Yes, dead.
An apt choice of words,considering the public
is convincedthat cigarettes are poisonous.
If we cant insist that theyre not,
I believe my most recent surveyshave provided a solution.
We can still suggest that cigarettesare part of American life,
or too good to give up,
or, most appealing,an assertion of independence.
So, basically, if you love danger,youll love smoking.
We can put a skulland crossbones on the label.
I love it.
Before the w*r,when I studied
with Adler in Vienna,we postulated
that what Freud calledthe death wish
is as powerful a driveas those for
sexual reproductionand physical sustenance.
Freud, you say?
What agency is he with?
Were supposedto believe
that people are allliving one way
and secretly thinkingthe exact opposite?
Thats ridiculous.
Let me tell you something,Miss Guttman...
Doctor.
Dr. Guttman.
Psychology might be greatat cocktail parties,
but it so happens that peoplewere buying cigarettes
before Freud was born.
The issue here isntwhy should people smoke.
Its why should peoplesmoke Lucky Strike.
Suggestingthat our customers have a...
What did you call it?
A death wish?
I just dont see thaton a billboard.
So what if Readers Digestsays theyre dangerous?
They also said Bambi wasthe book of the century.
Theres no proof.
Theres conclusive proofthat none of these
low-tar, low-nicotine,or filtration systems
have any effecton the incidences
of lung cancer.
Just give me the damn report.
I think youll find itvery convincing.
Im sure I will.
Youre the one who found all of ourmedical testimonials in the first place.
- Thats true, Mr. Drape but I...- Has anyone else seen this?
Of course not.Its your account.
Good.
I dont want to hearabout it anymore.
Im sorry. I just findyour whole approach perverse.
Good luck at the meeting.
Im sure it will be a quick one.
Sal, Ill take that drink now.
Mr. Draper.
Excuse me.
Mr. Draper.
Im sorry to wake you,but Mr. Campbell is outside.
He doesnt knowIm sleeping in here, does he?
- No, sir.- Thats good.
Who are you?
Im Peggy Olson.The new girl.
Can you go out thereand entertain him?
I know its my first day
and I dont want to seem uncooperative,but do I have to?
I see your point.
I brought you some aspirin.
Send him in.
You look likea hundred bucks.
Ready to go sweet-talksome retail Jews?
You are tough to takefirst thing in the morning, Pete.
Ive neverhad any complaints.
Speaking of which,whos your little friend here?
Shes the new girl.
You alwaysget the new girl.
Managementgets all the perks.
Where are you from,honey?
Miss DeaversSecretarial School.
Top notch.
But I meant where are you from?Are you Amish or something?
No. Im from Brooklyn.
Well, youre in the city now.
It wouldnt be a sinfor us to see your legs.
If you pull your waist in,you might look like a woman.
Is that all, Mr. Draper?
Hey, Im not done here.
Im working my way up.
That will be all.
Peggy, right?
Yes.
Oh, and its timefor your   :   meeting.
Oh, and sorry aboutMr. Campbell here.
He left his manners backat the fraternity house.
Shes a little youngfor you, Draper.
The future Mrs. Pete Campbellis a very lucky woman.
- Whens the wedding again?- Sunday.
Did Ken tell you about the bachelorparty tonight?
He sure did.
So do I getfirst crack at her?
Word is she took down moresailors than The Arizona.
How old are you, Pete?
I just turned   .
I bet the whole world looks likeone great big brassiere strap
just waitingto be snapped.
You are goodwith words, Draper.
Campbell, were both men here,so Im gonna be direct.
Christ, are you alreadysleeping with her?
Advertising isa very small world,
and when you do somethinglike malign the reputation
of a girl from the steno poolon her first day,
you make it even smaller.
Keep it up, and evenif you do get my job,
youll never run this place.
Youll diein that corner office,
a mid-level executivewith a little bit of hair
who women go home without of pity.
Want to know why?
Becauseno one will like you.
Oh! Here are ourmiracle-workers now.
You know Pete Campbell, of course,
your account executiveif you choose to do business with us.
And this handsome fellow is Don Draper,
the best creative director in New York.
Well, at least the building.
A pleasure to meet you.
- Sorry about that.- Im Rachel Menken.
Oh. Uh, sorry.I was expecting...
You were expecting me to be a man.
My father was, too.
And you are?
Why, Don,you remember David Cohen
from the art department.
Of course! David.
One of the rising starshere at Sterling Cooper.
Why dont we makeourselves comfortable?
Miss Menken,you can tell us what you have in mind.
Wonderful.
Thats very subtle.
Isnt that your shirt?
Had to go all the way to the mailroom,but I found one.
So you must be Peggy Olson.
Joan Holloway sent you over.
Shes a great girl.How is Joan?
She sends her regards.
Shes a lot of fun.
Must be a screamto work with her.
Yes, its prettyterrific.
Try to make yourselfcomfortable.
Relax.
I see from your chart,and your finger,
that youre not married.
Thats right.
And yet youre interestedin the contraceptive pills.
Well, I was...
No reason to be nervous.
Joan sent you to mebecause Im not here to judge you.
Theres nothing wrongwith a woman being practical
about the possibilityof sexual activity.
Spread your knees.
Thats good to hear.
Although, as a doctor,Id like to think
that putting a womanin this situation
is not gonna turn herinto some kind of strumpet.
Slide your fanny toward me.Im not gonna bite.
Ill warn you now,I will take you off this
medicine if you abuse it.
Its for your own good,really.
The fact is,even in our modern times,
easy womendont find husbands.
I understand,Dr. Emerson.
I really am a veryresponsible person.
Im sure youre notthat kind of girl.
Now, Joan...
Im just kidding along here.You can get dressed.
Im gonna write youa prescription for Enovid.
Theyre $   a month,but dont think
you have to go outand become the town pump
just to getyour moneys worth.
Excuse my French.
So what Don is sayingis that through
a variety of media,including a spot during
The Danny Thomas Show,if you can afford it,
we could really boostawareness.
Then, a   % off couponin select ladies magazines
will increase yourfirst-time visitors.
Once we get theminto the store,
the rest...
is kind of up to you.
Mr. Draper, our storeis    years old.
We share a wallwith Tiffanys.
Honestly, a coupon?
Miss Menken, coupons work.
I think your father wouldagree with the strategy.
He might, but hes not here becausewe just had our lowest sales year ever.
So I supposewhat I think
matters most right now.
Miss Menken,why did you come here?
There are a dozenother agencies
better suitedto your... needs.
If I wanted some manwho happened to be from the same...
village as my fatherto manage my account,
I could have stayedwhere I was.
Their research favorscoupons, too.
Its not just research,Miss Menken.
Housewives love coupons.
Im not interestedin housewives.
What kind of peopledo you want?
I want your kind ofpeople, Mr. Draper:
people who dont care about coupons,whether or not they can afford it.
People who are coming to the storebecause it is expensive.
We obviously havevery different ideas.
Yes, like the customeris always right.
Gentlemen, I really thoughtyou could do better than this.
Sterling Cooper has a reputationfor being innovative.
Miss, you are way out of line.
Don, please. Letsnot get emotional here.
Theres no reasonwe cant talk this out.
Talk out what? This silly ideathat people are gonna come
to some store theyve never been tobecause its more expensive?
It works for Chanel.
Menkens is not Chanel.
Thats a vote of confidence.
What Dons saying is,Chanel is a very
different kind of place.
Its French,its continental, its...
Not just anotherJewish department store?
Exactly.
You were right, Roger.This place really runs on charm.
This is ridiculous.
Im not gonna let a womantalk to me like this.
This meeting is over.Good luck, Miss Menken.
Hey, Don,I dont blame you.
She was way out of line.
Adding money and education
doesnt take the rudeedge out of people.
Rogers not gonna be happy,so I guess thats good for you.
Im not gonna pretendI dont want your job,
but you were right.Im not great with people,
and you are. I mean, not countingthat meeting we were just in.
So Im kind of countingon you to help me out.
Theres plenty of room at the top.
Look, Im sorryI was so hard on you before.
Its just this damntobacco thing.
Youll think of something.
A man like youId follow into combat blindfolded,
and I wouldnt be the first.
Am I right, buddy?
Lets take it a little slower.
I dont want to wake up pregnant.
Dr. Emersons a dream, isnt he?
He seemed nice.
He has a placein South Hampton.
Im not sayingthat Ive seen it,
but its beautiful.
Now, dont be nervous,but this is
the nerve centerof the office.
You and your boss relyon the willing and
cheerful cooperationof a few
k*ll employees.
Never snap, yell, or besarcastic with them.
And above all,always be a supplicant.
I know you girls are busy,but weve got a new one.
Peggy, this is Marge,Nanette, and Ivy.
I brought you some things.
I guess a sort of"getting to know you" gift.
Well, arent youa sweetheart.
If I know Joan,the candys for me.
Joan, youre not fair.
You knowshe has to lose   pounds
by the Christmas party.
I think you look great.
Thats becauseIm sitting down.
You can come back and visitany time you want, honey.
Who does she work for?
Don Draper.
They got ridof Eleanor?
She moved on.
Draper wasnt interested.
Well, she couldntget a call through.
Rude little thing.
I see that youve gotyour hands full.
Dont want to bea bother.
Nice meeting you.
Hey,you have great legs.
I bet you Mr. Draper would like themif he could see them.
Sterling Cooper.How may I direct your call?
I just dont knowwhat we have to do
to make these governmentinterlopers happy.
They tell us to makea safer cigarette,
we do it,and then suddenly
thats not good enough.
Might as well beliving in Russia.
Mm. Damn straight.
You know, this morningI got a call
from my competitorsat Brown & Williamson,
and theyre getting suedby the federal government
because of the health claims they made.
Yeah, were aware of that, Mr. Garner,
but you have to realize that throughthe manipulation of the mass media,
the public is under the impressionthat your cigarettes are linked to...
certain fatal diseases.
Manipulation of the media?


Hell,thats what I pay you for.
Our product is fine.
I smoke em myself.
My granddad smoked em.
He died at    years old.
He was hit by a truck.
I understand.But our hands are tied.
Were no longer allowed to advertisethat Lucky Strikes are safe.
What the hellare we gonna do?
Weve already fundedour own tobacco
research centerto put this whole
rumor to rest.
And thatsa very good start.
But it may notaffect sales.
Don, I think maybethats your cue.
Well, uh...
I have been, uh...
thinking quite a bitabout this,
and, uh...
I mean, you know Im aLucky Strike man from way back, so...
I might have a solution.
At Sterling Cooper,weve been pioneering
the burgeoning fieldof research,
and our analysis showsthat the health risks
associated with your productis not the end of the world.
People get in their carsevery day to go to work,
and some of them die.
Cars are dangerous.
Theres nothingyou can do about it.
You still have to getwhere youre going.
Cigarettes are exactly the same,
so why dont we simply say,
"So what if cigarettes are dangerous?
"Youre a man.
"The world is dangerous.
"Smoke your cigarette.
You still have to getwhere youre going. "
Thats very interesting.
I mean, if cigaretteswere dangerous,
- it would be interesting.- Except they arent.
Thats your slogan?
"Youre going to die anyway.Die with us"?
Actually, its a fairly well-established
psychological principlethat society has a death wish,
and if we couldjust tap into that,
the market potential is...
What the hell are youtalking about?
Are you insane?
Im notselling r*fles here.
Im in the tobaccobusiness.
Were selling America.
The Indian gave it to us, for shit sake.
Come on, Dad.
Lets get out of here.
The bright spot is,at least we know
if wehave this problem,
everybodyhas this problem.
Gentlemen, before you leave,can I just say something?
I dont know, Don. Can you?
The Federal Trade Commissionand Readers Digest
have done you a favor.
Theyve let you know that any adthat brings up the concept of cigarettes
and health together...
well, its just gonnamake people think of cancer.
Yes, and weregrateful to them.
But what Lee, Jr.,said is right.
If you cant makethose health claims,
neithercan your competitors.
So weve gota lot of people
not saying anythingthat sells cigarettes.
Not exactly.
This is the greatestadvertising opportunity
since the inventionof cereal.
We have six identical companiesmaking six identical products.
We can say anything we want.
How do youmake your cigarettes?
I dont know.
Shame on you.
We breed insect-repellenttobacco seeds,
plant them inthe North Carolina
sunshine,grow it, cut it,
cure it, toast it...
There you go. There you go.
But everybody elsestobacco is toasted.
No. Everybody elsestobacco is poisonous.
Lucky Strike...
is toasted.
Gentlemen,I dont think I have to tell you
what you just witnessed here.
I think you do.
Advertisingis based on one thing:
happiness.
And you know what happiness is?
Happinessis the smell of a new car.
Its freedom from fear.
Its a billboardon the side of the road
that screams with reassurancethat whatever youre doing...
its okay.
You are okay.
Its toasted.
I get it.
You had me worried.
I dont know if you were drunk
or not drunk,but that was inspired.
For the record,I pulled it out of thin air,
so thank you, up there.
Youre lookingin the wrong direction.
So now that Ive got youin the afterglow here,
what do you say you reconsiderthis presidential campaign?
I dont know.Bunting and babies?
Thats hard work.
I would make hash of it.
Modesty.Thats adorable.
Consider the product:hes young, handsome,
Navy hero.
Honestly, it shouldnt be too difficult
to convince AmericaDick Nixon is a winner.
Mr. Draper,youve got visitors.
Could you be a littlemore specific, honey?
We heardyou saved the day.
Aw, thank you, boys.
I appreciate it.
I told themhow amazing you were.
Im still tingling.
Looks like youre all going to engagein a little mid-level camaraderie,
so Ill be on my way.Don, thanks again for the home run.
I love to come through.
Any chance you could patch things upwith Rachel Menken?
Any way you can be as charmingas I said you were?
Havent you had enough of my magicfor one day?
Shes worth $  million.
Youre a whore.
Peggy...
Could she get us a little more ice?
Yes, Mr. Draper?
Just a minute.
Fellas, I think this partys gonnahave to move elsewhere.
Well move wherever you want,but its  :  .
The bachelor partys underway.
I dont know.
Oh, come on, Don.All hands on deck.
Arent you gonna helpgive Pete his big sendoff?
Maybe next time.
Come on, guys.Don will join us later, right?
If Gretas researchwas any good,
I would have used it.
What are youtalking about?
Im sayingI had a report
just like that.
And its not like theressome magic machine
that makes identicalcopies of things.
I still thinkshe was right.
Have a great night, Pete.
Congratulations.
I heard you wereamazing in the meeting.
Fear stimulatesmy imagination.
I just wanted to thank youfor a great first day,
and for, you know...
standing up for mewith Mr. Campbell.
First of all, Peggy,Im your boss,
not your boyfriend.
Second of all,you ever let Pete Campbell
go through my trash again,
and you wont be able to find a jobselling sandwiches in Penn Station.
He said he lefthis fountain pen in here.
I didnt know.
I hope you dont thinkIm that kind of girl.
Of course not.
Go home.
Put your curlers in.
Well get a fresh starttomorrow.
Oh. And, Peggy,I need you
to place a call.
I want to see you here every    minutes,whether you have drinks or not.
Uh, every five minutes.
Lets live here.
Better do morethan look tonight.
Do you have a girlfriend,Salvatore?
Come on. Im Italian.
Is there some kindof party here?
How did you swing it?
They work at the Automat.
He pressed a button,and they came out.
I do hope were notinterrupting anything.
Definitely not.
Well, I have the best seat.
What are we drinking?
More of whatevers making youthe way you are.
I love this place.
Its hot, loud,and filled with men.
I know what you mean.
Oh, my God. I canhardly feel it.
I have a feeling yourelike this all the time.
I like to laugh.
Is that right?
Now,you stop that.
You said you liketo laugh.
I mean it.
Its... Its too...
Too delicious.
I said stop it.
- What do you think youre doing?- You know exactly.
You know what, girls?I think we should go.
Oh, come on.
Youre hurting me.
Ill be good.
Buy the girls whatever they want.
So, uh, what do you fellas do?
Youre looking at the finestad men in New York.
Hell, the world.
For the lady, a special Mai Tai,
and one whiskey neat.
So youre goingto ply me with drinks
and convince mewhat a terrible mistake Im making.
That is quite a drink.
You got in trouble,didnt you?
I shouldnthave lost my temper,
and I certainlyshouldnt have treated you
like anythingless than a client.
Apology accepted.
So you understand.
Now I do.
It was, uh,refreshing, really.
I mean, actuallyhearing all the things
I always assumedpeople were thinking.
Well, Im not reallyas bad as all that.
I was undera lot of pressure.
Another account.
Doesnt really matter.
No, it doesnt.
So, withoutmaking things worse,
can I ask youa personal question?
Dont you want to geta second drink in me first?
Why arent you married?
Are you askingwhats wrong with me?
Its just that yourea beautiful, educated woman.
Dont you think that getting married
and having a familywould make you happier
than all the headachesthat go along with
fighting people like me?
If I werent a woman,I would be
allowed to ask youthe same question,
and if I werent a woman,I wouldnt have to choose
between putting on an apron
and the thrillof making my fathers store
what I always thought it should be.
So thats it.You wont get married because
you find business to be a thrill.
That and...
Ive never been in love.
She wont get marriedbecause shes never been in love.
I think I wrote thatonce to sell nylons.
For a lot of people,love isnt just a slogan.
Oh, you mean love.
You mean the biglightning bolt to the heart
where you cant eatand you cant work
and you just run offand get married
and make babies.
The reasonyou havent felt it
is becauseit doesnt exist.
What you call lovewas invented by guys like me
to sell nylons.
Is that right?
Im pretty sureabout it.
Youre born alone,and you die alone,
and this world just dropsa bunch of rules on you
to make youforget those facts,
but I never forget.
