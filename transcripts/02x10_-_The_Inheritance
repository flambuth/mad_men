Its everyone whos building a rocket.
Do you know, if we stay in Beverly Hills,
even though the conventionsin Santa Monica,
well be halfway to Pasadena.
Pasadena?
Isnt it just people with T. B?
Jet Propulsion Laboratoriesand Ray Bradbury.
As much as Id like to indulge
your Twilight Zone fantasyof being sh*t into space...
Believe me, its our fantasy, too.
This is a business trip.
I dont want either of you coming back tan.
What if I have to play golf?
As long as you lose.
Crab Colson guarantees there will besome astronauts there.
Really? My nephewswould love an autograph.
Astronauts love golf.Ill see what I can do.
Youre there to sell,but youre also there to listen.
Every scientist, engineer,and general is trying
to figure out a wayto put a man on the moon
or blow up Moscow,whichever one costs more.
We have to explain to themhow we can help them spend that money.
Well, it certainly wouldbehoove us to find out...
Campbell, you do the talking.Kinsey, you do the listening.
Don, you wanted me to remind themabout the congressmen.
We know.They control the purse strings.
No. They are the customer.
They want aerospace in their districts.
Let them know that we can help thembring these contracts home.
Did you read anything that she prepared?
Maybe I should send her.
You know Ill stay out of your way.
Of course.
Lounging at the pool.
Theyll think yourea young Barbara Stanwyck.
Doesnt that sound like fun?
If youre there, it will make me lookless serious in the office.
Next time.
Its a week, Tweety.
I suppose I can go tomy parents place in Rehoboth.
Now youre making me feel bad.
Is that the only alternative?
They keep asking to spend time with me.
Well, us.
Theyre concerned.
About what?
Nothings happening.
Why do you insist on making meangry before I go to bed?
There are some very reputable agencies.
We cant even talk about this?
Do I have to put my foot down?
Whats wrong with it?
Its someone elses child.
Once you see a beautiful little baby,youll fall in love.
You know you will.
Its not natural.
I felt that way.
But it changed.
We would have our pick.
We are ideal candidates.
We have means,and weve been to doctors,
so its on the record that its somethingweve been wanting for a long time.
Do your parents just thinkI say no to everything?
Were not related by bl*od,and you love me.
Hello.
Its me.
What time is it?
Its 10:00. Are you sleeping?
No.
William called.
My father had a stroke.
Jesus.
Three days ago.
Gloria didnt even call me.She had William call.
Is it bad?
She said hes up and around, talking,
but she wouldnt put him on the phone.
Im coming to get you.
No.
Bets, its not up for discussion.
Take the kids to Francine.
I dont want to wake them.
Fine.
Ill be by in the morning.
God.
You know, Ive beendreaming about a suitcase?
Everythings gonna be okay.
Sure.
Everythings perfect.
Ill be by at 8.
Bye-bye.
Hello, Betty.
Hello, Gloria.
Hello, Don.
Look at the two of you.
I swear to you,the doctors say its not serious.
We can get a room down the roadat the William Penn.
Nonsense.
Where is he? Can I see him?
Hes getting dressed.
They said he should do things on his own.
Come sit.
Dont do that.
Were supposed to keep it dim.
I dont know why.
Let me check on him.
William. I wasnt expecting you.
- Good morning.- Look whos here.
He doesnt seem that bad.
Don, good to see you.
Sorry about your dad.
Well get by, right?
Judys coming later.
Shes dropping the girls offat her mothers.
Gloria, everything is copasetic.
Itll be nice to see her.
Its an angel.
Hi, Daddy.
Thats what I needed.
Hello, Don.
Get that look off your face.
Good to see you, Gene.
Ill take a visit from you twoany way I can get it.
Where are the munchkins?
With a neighbor.
Pop, did you see Dons car?
You finally step up to a Lincoln?
Coupe De Ville.
Ice-blue, white top.
Very nice.
How you feeling, Daddy?
Its a tempest in a teapot.
You shouldve seen her in the ambulance.
Well, we were halfway to the hospitalbefore I noticed I was in my nightie.
A woman my age should not travel that way.
I wish youd called earlier.
The other partners at Dons firmknow all kinds of doctors.
In New York, right,where everythings better.
Always with her brow in a knit,my Ruthie here.
Ruthie, my love, have you offeredeverybody coffee?
Im Betty.
Of course you are.
Gene, this is Betty, your daughter.
Its not Ruth. Ruth is dead.
Nobody wants coffee, Daddy.
Don, you were able to get off work?
Im here.
- You want a drink?- Ill get some ice.
What did the doctors say?
Its just like last time.
What?
Last time? This happened before?
Dont get mad at her.Its a couple little strokes.
Runs in the family.
You know Gene.
Always has to be the onetaking care of things.
So, Don, how did you come?
Did you take the Turnpike?
Yes.
Look at this. Its my lunch date.
Hello, baby. Youre early.
You remember Ken and Pete?
Hello, Sheila.
Want to get in a few more mealsbefore you lose him to the Golden West?
What are you talking about?
Were going to Los Angeles together.
Its horrible, but somebody has to go.
Where?
Californ-I-A.
Thank you, Pete.
Come on, Campbell.
Time to put something else in that mouth.
Nice to see you.
I was going to tell you at lunch.
Why are you going to Los Angeles?
Come on. Not here.
It just came up.
The elections not for months.
We can register voters in October.
It has nothing to do with the election.
You know that.
If you dont mind,
Id rather face Mississippiand those people screaming at me
and maybe getting sh*tafter I go to California.
Are you scared?
Dont pretend like its not scary.
Look, I have to go.
Why? What is so important?
Its a convention.
Im not allowed to talk about it.
Hello, Mr. Kinsey.
Please, Hollis. Its Paul.
This is Sheila, my girlfriend.
Nice to meet you.
Did you ever really planon going down South?
How could you ask that?
This just came up.
You can always get anotherjob at a grocery store.
I cant just walk into an ad agency.
I cant believe you.
All you do is complain aboutthat place and those people.
Thats not true.
Well, Im going.
I guess Ill just hop in Billy Kaplans buswith ten strangers.
Why cant it wait?
19th Street.
This was all supposed to be ours.
I keep thinking what would havehappened if Dad had lived.
Hed be on his knees to us.
What about all that moneyDad gave to Lincoln Center?
Get that back.
You cant take a donation back.
Listen, Im as upset as you are.
Were about to finally buy in Millbrook.
How long can she afford to live?
By golly, Pete, maybe we canget rid of her tonight.
Remember Rope?
Well, look, all we have to do
is go over there, get her signature,
mourn over the lossof our birthright, and move on.
I hate going there.
The smell.
To the end of the line.
Does Judy want kids?
We have a five-year plan.
Although secretly I think Judy hopes
were that childless couplepeople invite over.
Trudy?
Weve tried.
That must be disappointing.
Adoption.
People do that.
They do.
So, the Yankees are having a hell of a year.
Do you take Bobby?
All the time.
We really thought you were goingto make it to Cape May.
Although without Betty there,everyone had a turn at winning.
Elizabeths got a mind for cards.
Where were you?
I was hiding in the tree house.
Its like a tomb in there.
I dont know how Dons standing it.
Is this the last pictureof her in the house?
I dont know.
And wheres the ottoman with the birds?
I dont know, Betty.
I mean, can you blame her?
I wouldnt want to live with Moms ghost.
Shes a silly woman.
All that talk about her underthings.
Daddy used to fine usfor small talk, remember?
Conversation is an art.
Well, it is.
How long has he been like this?
He was acting q*eeron the golf course last month.
Let one of the colored caddiesreally have it.
Look, Glorias helping us.
Okay? I dont want to get stuck with him
just because I cared enoughnot to move away.
Don works in Manhattan.
You know I wish I could be here.
You only have two kids.
Lord knows Don could affordto build him a house
in his backyard if he wanted to.
Stop counting other peoples money.
And the jardini?re.
The what?
It used to be right there.
The ceramic thing?
I think we have that.
Do I have to go around and write my nameon all the things that I want?
Bets, youre drunk.
Well, I hope everybodys hungry.
Were minutes away.
Why is that window open?
Well, look at that. You found a corner.
Youre pulling your end.
Cant say the same about him.
Dons helping.
Who know what he does, why he does it?
I know more about the kidwho fixes my damn car.
Dad, youre hurting Dons feelings.
Its okay.
Nobody has what you have.
You act like its nothing.
My daughters a princess.You know that?
Dinnertime.
Whats going on?
He has no people!
You cant trust a person like that!
Daddy.
Fine. Lets go eat.
Come on.
I have no appetite.
Birdie, you should eat.
Stop it, Don.
Nobodys watching.
And here, Mother.
How many of these are there?
Hello, all.
I brought my pen.Hope I didnt miss anything.
Other than dinner, no.
Hello, Mother.
I think its nice that even thoughyou let Bud do all the work,
you found time to grace uswith your signature.
Yes, well, anything I can do.
I just hope you dont get too used to this.
To what?
This family.
It has come to my attentionthat you and Trudy
are considering a child thats not your own.
Is this true?
It just came up.
How is that possible?
Peter, I would hateto have to exclude you
from what is rightfully yours.
You have to keep at it.
You know what, Mother?
This is not a topic of conversation.
I think you know how your father feltabout the whole idea.
Its suitable for some.
But really,youre pulling from the discards.
My father?
- Yes.- Pete.
Your husband spent everything you had.
Spent it with strangers.
All of it.
What are you talking about?
Ill messenger theseto your office tomorrow.
Thats a swell idea.
The tone of your voice... I dont like it.
That, too?
Stop being dramatic.
Bud, what is my fiduciary state?
Tell her.
Well...
We had to liquidate your holdingsto ensure your future comfort.
Why?
Who asked you to do that?
The market took a turn for the worse.
Real estate?
I think I would have heard about that.
Yes, well, dont forgetto send those by my office.
Do you want me tolay everything out for you?
Its been a day.I just want to go to sleep.
Youre smoking like a chimney.
It gives you wrinkles, you know.
Good morning, everyone.
Gene.
Morning, Don.
I have some batter left.Would you like some waffles?
No. This will be fine.
And coffee.
- Morning, everybody.- Do you want breaktast?
No.
I had no idea.
Please, Judy, its okay.
No, its yours. I feel terrible.
I didnt know yourmother promised it to you.
Really, Judy, its okay.
I wish he hadnt brought it up with you.
Im putting it over here.
Isnt Viola coming today?
Later.
Theres no chance shell miss you.
- Leave the dishes.- Nonsense.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
Now that youve fed me,why dont we go upstairs?
Gene!
Im fine.
I dont know what to say.Hes so mixed up.
Gene, you are mixed up.
Youre mixed up.
Hes tired. He didnt sleep last night.
Of course.
Dad, you have to go back to the doctor.
I already have an appointment for Monday.
So... Daddy, what would youlike to do today?
Finish that puzzle?
Sure.
And maybe drive into town.
Get you a milkshake.
Thats a grand idea.
Come in.
Finally.
I told her to call you.
You should have called me.
Hello, Viola.
And you two look good, considering.
How are the children?
Theyre good.
Im gonna make some calls.
You should be here every day.
Thats not up to me.
Why not?Youve been here longer than her.
He needs you.
I dont know about that.
And you let Gloria and Judyransack the house.
You want to give me your temper?
He doesnt know who I am.
Hes very, very sick.
You dont know how nice it isto hear someone say that.
Is he dying?
I was at Elkins Park Hospital on Sundaywhen they talked to her.
Its just gonna get worse.
I dont know how much more I can take.
Well, this day comes eventually,like it or not.
Im an orphan.
You are supposedto take care of your husband
and your beautiful children now.
They are yours.
Youll see.
The minute you leave,youll remember him
exactly the way he used to be.
Its all good outside that door.
Want these upstairs?
No. I have to put it all in the wash.
Ill go get the kids.
Francine promised themthe pool tomorrow.
Carla will bring them home later.
Im gonna take a shower.
Don.
What?
I think you should leave.
Really?
Yes.
Bets, youre upset.
I am.
And I know how you feel about grieving.
I think I should be here for you.
Thats your reason.
What do you want me to say?
I want to be here.
You need me here.
Why?
Nothings changed.
We were just pretending.
Good afternoon, Mr. Draper.
Hello, Donna.
Allison.
Of course.
Surprise!
And this beautiful layette.
Weve also attemptedto fortify your castle.
Lucky Strike, Martinson Coffee,
Pampers, and some Clearasil,for when it gets bigger.
You raided the storeroom for me.
Now, Daddy-o, weve giventhis a lot of thought.
You are going to be blessedwith a stinking miracle.
Stop it!
So, in assessing the damageto your private life,
weve gotten you some reading material.
What do you get for the manwhos about to have nothing?
- No, no, no, no.- Speech, speech.
Im very touched by this party.
Thats the whole point.
Youre not going to be touched.
I got it, Paul. Knock it off.
I want to toast all of you.
And lets hope when this baby comesthat he likes Luckys.
Heres to the little one,whatever it may be.
- Cheers.- Salut.
I just wanted to say Happy Birthday.
Whats this?
Tiffanys?
Whos it from?
From Jane.
And Roger, Im sure.
Will you cut the cake, dear?
Mr. Draper.
I wasnt expecting you till tomorrow.
How is everything?


About how those things are.
Joan, if you dont mind,can I borrow you for a moment?
- Of course.- Thank you.
Thank you.
And you have your meetingwith Mr. Odino at 10 tomorrow.
And then Lee Garner, Jr.and the TV department at 3.
Cancel everything.
Yes, of course.
Reschedule for Friday?
No. Clear the week.
So. How was your family emergency?
Memorable. Thank you.
I assume that means everythings okay?
Im leaving for California tomorrowfor the Rocket Fair.
Good for you.
Sunshine, bikinis.
But didnt we already send a couple men?
Campbell and Kinsey?
Not yet.
Well, Campbell has got to go.
Ive held his hand through 30 phone calls.
Very good, Don.Bring me a bag of oranges.
Im sure Joan here can hold down the fort.
Shes been doing it so far.
Told you youd be in good handswith Miss Holloway.
Ill need you to send a memo to Mr. Kinseyexplaining this change in plans.
Ill take care of it.
You look like you didntget any sleep last night.
I did.
Go ahead. Lay down.
Ill keep the drunks away.
I heard its very hardto get anything done there
because of the weather, you know?
People dont work.
Sounds good to me.
Im sure Ill be going sometimein the next few months.
All the networks keep saying
how I need to come outand shave my face.
I mean show.
Whats in this?
Youre just gonna fly offand leave your wife and newborn?
I just want to saythat I am so happy for you
and that youre gonna be the best father
and that Im really happy for you.
Thank you.
- Mr. Kinsey?- Yes, Joan.
Mr. Draper wanted you to be informedthat he will be going to Los Angeles
for the convention.
Great. We wont have to fly tourist.
No. Its just he and Mr. Campbell going.
What?
Dons going with Pete?
He cant do that.
Im sure it must be disappointing.
Ill need your tickets and your badges.
Thats not right. Why cant we all go?
I really need everything right away.
Or are they at home?
Is there any cake left?
Hey, Sheila. Its me.
No, I know that.
And I want you to knowIve thought about it...
Let me finish.
Im going to stand therearm-in-arm with you
and make a stand.
Its not just about you and me.
I know that.
No ones been sh*t lately. Okay?
I love you, too, baby.
Peggy.
May I speak with you?
Heck of a party.
Yes.
Im going away, you know.
Of course.
On a plane.
What do you want me to say?
That I wish I was going?
Everybody does.
Ive never even been on a plane.
Well, I have.
But not since my father died.
Im sorry.
Im not scared.
It just seems significant, is all.
Statistically speaking,
its very unlikely that it will happen
to two people in one family.
Thats true.
Besides, it wouldnt be the worst thing.
Excuse me?
I hate my mother.
What do you think of that?
Come on, you must have an opinion.
I dont know the circumstances.
I dont know what I should expect from her.
I dont know her.
Like Bud and I turned out so great.
Whos to say it wouldnt be better?
So its not yours. That could be good.
I dont know what youre talking about.
But I think your flight will be fine.
You should go home.
Everythings so easy for you.
Its not easy for anyone, Pete.
Have a great trip.
Whats there?
Glen?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
How long have you been out here?
I dont know.
A few days.
What happened?
I didnt know if I wasgoing to see you again.
And then you werent even home.
Did you run away?
So?
I think you should tell me what happened.
My dad wants Charlotteand me to live with him.
My mom doesnt care.
Im sure thats not true.
She just wants to be with her boyfriends.
Does she have a lot of boyfriends?
I guess.
They give me things.
I havent seen you in so long,except driving down the street.
I know. I know.
Can I use the bathroom?
Do you want me to wash your clothes?
Is that shirt okay?
That almost fits you.
Go ahead.
Why are you alone here?
Its the middle of the day.
Its lousy.
You understand why your motherwas mad at me, I hope.
Yeah.
Because she doesnt understand.
Thats true.
Im not going home.
Because I know Im a problem for them.
Glen.
I know I am becausethey keep saying Im not.
Did you do something?
No.
But my mom is never home.
My dad has another baby.
His wife is pretty mean.
Wheres your mother?
I dont know.
Writing pamphlets and handing them out.
Im pretty responsible.
I brush my sisters teethand put us both to bed.
Thats very sweet of you.
Arent you going to eat?
Can I tell you something?
Of course.
I dont like ham.
I dont like meat at all, actually.
Im sorry.
Do you want me to make yousome macaroni and cheese?
I came to rescue you.
Did you bring your cape?
Im not joking.
We can go anywhere. I have money.
Glen...
- Mommy! I missed you!- Mommy!
I missed you, too.
How is he?
- Who?- Your father.
Hes not good.
Carla, this is Glen Bishop.
Sally, Bobby, you rememberGlen from down the street.
Hi, Glen.
Hi.
Why dont you take Glen upstairsand show him the trains Daddy got you?
You can use the controls.
Go ahead. Its okay.
Whats he doing here?
Youre really bad.
You think you can do any better?
If I couldnt, Id give up trying.
What dont you likeabout the speed shear?
Glen, can you come in here?
Glen, get over here now.
I was worried sick.
Glen, you have to go home.
You cant do things like this.
Lets go. Your fathers on his way.
I hate you.
Apologize right this minute.
No, its true.
I hate you.
I know.
Im sorry.
Come on. Lets wash up for dinner.
Advertising, if anything,helps bring on change.
The market... and Im talkingin a purely Marxist sense...
dictates that we must include everyone.
The consumer has no color.
Betty, Im sorry,but we really need to talk.
Theres nothing to talk about.
I dont know why he was over here,but this has to stop.
Nothings going on.
Except that Glen feels alone.
Honestly, I dont blame him.
What did he say?
Nothing.
But its obvious.
He depends on you for everything.
Youre supposed to be taking care of him.
Youre his mother.
And he gets nothing.
I thought with Dan out of our lives,it would be different.
Glens right.
Im not a very good mother anymore.
Don isnt living here.
Im sorry.
We havent told the children.
Is it over?
I dont even know.
Thats the worst.
Do they see him?
He takes them to dinner.
They dont know what made themso special all of the sudden.
I dont know.
For me, it wasnt that differentwithout him there.
Sometimes I feel like Ill float away
if Don isnt holding me down.
The hardest partis realizing youre in charge.
As you can see, the pilot has turned offthe "No Smoking" sign.
Were expecting clear skiesen route to Los Angeles today.
It should be a pleasant day,
82 degrees and clear,with a light Santa Ana wind.
Trans World Airlines...
