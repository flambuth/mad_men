Remind me,when did you stop taking the pills?
They ran out on the 2nd.
Id say I would expect to be fertile againat the end of the cycle,
although from my experience,its more likely a month.
All this time Ive been afraid to skip one,but it could take a month?
Why dont you join him for basic training?It would boost the mens morale.
From what I remember,San Antonio is lovely this time of year.
We dont know when hes going.
Youve been married two years, Joan?Most gals your age dont wait.
We have a plan.
JoJo, I know its none of my business,
but I only went to Koreabecause they made me.
I didnt have a choice or a wife.
All I want to know isif my husband and I can start a family...
When my husband and I can start a family.
Go get them.
-Walter.-Yes?
I just want to make sure that...
Well, you know Ive hada couple of procedures.
I just want to make surethey dont affect anything.
A couple? I only remember one.
There was one before that.Should I be worried?
Was the other performed by a physician?
She said she was a midwife.
Well, you got pregnant subsequently,and I know everything went fine here.
And, physically, everything looks fine.
Like the song says,"Whatever will be, will be."
Happy New Year.
-Good morning, Mr. Draper.-Good morning, Allison.
Coffee?
Yes, please.
Im glad I caught you before you left.
The flights not until 12:30.
Well, still, youve got to tight the touristsfor a taxi,
and then if you hit traffic,Triborough Bridge,
somebodys always running out of gas,and I think you know who.
So I saw, on your way to Acapulco,you have 24 hours in Los Angeles.
What do you want?
The Brown Derby, Bill Asher.Hell probably try to cast you.
-Morning, Don, Harry.-Hello.
-Am I interrupting?-No.
Ill see you at the traffic meetingthis afternoon.
Were still doing that? Why?
Just go to England already.Stop feeling guilty.
Take two weeks. Youll be twice as happy.
Im happy when Im working.
And Im sure another day and a half of workwill not come close
to the amount of fiddling aboutyou did in Los Angeles this year.
Okay. Happy New Year, Don.
There you are.Please make sure he signs these.
If I dont see you, happy New Year.
Enjoy your family.
-Would you like to sign these now?-Might as well.
So, what will you be doing?
Dont worry. Ill be here till the bitter end.
No, I mean for New Years.
Im gonna go see my sister in Patersonover the weekend,
and, I dont know, probably Times Square.
I always wondered who did that.
It was a little scary last year,
but I think well have a whole bunch of girlsthis time.
-And sailors.-Im sure.
But for the rest of the week, if you want meor someone else on your desk
-for West Coast hours, I can arrange that.-Ill be fine.
Well, Ill let you knowwhen you should leave.
Thank you.
Why is the door shut?
I dont like pipe smoke.Hes very considerate.
-Could you tell him Im here?-What is this regarding?
Sorry to bother you,but since Rogers not here,
I am sending Caroline uptownto get me some fried chicken for lunch,
and I know you like it. Interested?
I am.
Breast? Thigh?
One of each.
I wanted to ask you,I would like to put in a request now
for a few days offthe second week of January.
But you have New Years off.
My husbands a doctor.His schedules not flexible.
Why dont you go homeand ask him how he would feel
about some nurse asking for a holidayimmediately following a holiday?
I would be happy with two days.
Our financial planning and expense budgetsfor next year,
Ill need you to assist me.
We can do it now.No one Knows why were here anyway.
Because theres work to do.
And I understand that all men are dizzyand powerless to refuse you,
but consider me the incorruptible exception.
Fried chicken indeed.
Im sorry. I shouldnt have asked.
Now dont go and cry about it.
Excuse me?
I said, dont go and cry about it.
Hey.
Get off my porch.
You actually came.
What the hell happened to your leg?
Its broken.It didnt work that well to begin with.
How are you?
You just need a little R&R.
What happened?
Heres the lesson.Dont fry eggs in bare feet.
Sit down.
-What do you want?-Half of what you have.
Youve got a leak.
I fixed the roof. It just needs a little makeup.
Call a painter.
I dont know. Once it stopped smelling,I kind of forgot about it.
I wondered whose car that was. Hello, Dick-
-Hello, Patty. its been too long.-Stephanie.
Stephanie. Last time I saw you,you didnt have front teeth.
Theyre helping mewhile Im in my fragile state,
although no one asked them to.
Can I get you something?
No, we live in South Pasadena.Its a long drive.
-Are you staying?-Just for the night.
-Here?-Patty,
remember you told me to tell youif you were intruding?
Try to keep her off her feet.
The cast isnt stable,and we dont need any more accidents.
Aunt Anna, I just left everything on the bed.I dont Know where things go.
You can tell by looking.
Shes never gotten over meflunking home-ec.
Dick, fix her a drink.
-Are you drinking age?-Yes, but dont bother.
Stephanie is studying Poli Sci at Cal.She should be studying music.
Berkeley? Are you sitting in?
I agree with what theyre doing,but somebodys gotta go to class.
-Steph, are you ready?-Why dont you two stay for dinner?
Glenn and I have a bridge gameat the Dicksons,
and hes expecting a dinner of his own.
Good, cause I only want her to stay.
How will she get home?
I have a car.
Or shell spend the night.You can get her in the morning.
Okay, you figure it out.Good night, sweetheart.
You know Im very grateful.
-If I dont see you, Dick, happy New Year.-Happy New Year.
Im going to wash the road off me,
and then we are going to that placewith the beer and abalone.
Perfect. Sounds like theres towelsall over the bed.
Why am I staying?
I wanted him to meet you,and I know youve got grass.
Hello.
Come over here.
Is that your dinner?
I love your chicken.
How was the doctor?
Everythings good.
Good. I have to go.
Let me at least heat it up.You can take it with you.
Peabodys offered his place in the Poconosfor the 14th and 15th.
Greg, I cant get away, not then.
Jeanie, I have to work New Years.I had to trade it for January.
Then get one of the Jewish docs to do it.You worked on their holiday.
Jeanie, you dont thinkId rather be smelling perfume than Lysol?
Tell me what you want me to do.
Because its not your problem, too?
Why dont you just not show up?
Ill lose my job.
-Well make it.-Until when?
Until I leave for basic,
and then its just a couple of weeks,and then Ill be home.
And then youre going to Vietnam.
We dont know that.
That makes me feel better.
Just keep marking off the dayson the calendar
while I keep planning for our future.
Ill see you tomorrowwhen youre on your way out.
You dont even know when youre going!
Soon.
So Id say Laura was the worst roommate.
She had a nervous breakdown-
One morning, shes reading the Bibleinstead of her psych book.
The next morning she woke me up,leaning over me with this crazy smile
and said, "Morning, Stephanie.Have you heard the good news?"
There are worse things.
No, there arent.
Where did you go to school, Dick?
I strung togethera few nonconsecutive years
in night school, City College.
A self-made man.
Whats it like taking off your suitand returning to the wild?
I really dont likehow political youre getting.
Im not political.I just dont understand whos in charge.
Youre in charge.
Trust me. I work in advertising.
Youre kidding me.
Its pollution.
So stop buying things.
Dont think thats not possible.
Ill say this in terms youll understand.
I will be right back after this brief messagefrom Jan and Dean.
I like to think I had a bit of a hand in that.
You and God.
Young people are gonna save us.
How would you feelabout me bringing the kids out this spring?
Really?
You know how badlyIve wanted to meet them.
So what, Ill be their aunt?
Wait till they tell Betty that.
You told me you told her everything.Shell understand.
I dont think shell ever understand.
You had to know shed be hurt.
After I told her, I felt relieved.
I kept thinking how small it wascompared to how long it went on.
-Small?-I know. I know.
Its just...
I could tell.
The minute she saw who I really was,
she never wanted to look at me again.
Which is why I never told her.
Dick.
Im sorry she broke your heart.
I had it coming.
I thought Id play somethingso you two could dance.
How the hell am I gonna dance?
I dont know how you ever danced to this.
Come on.
Keep your hands at 10:00 and 2:00.
So you picked this song because its old?
That doesnt mean its bad.
Its kind of corny.
I think it sounds like shes inviting usto a very beautiful place
where theres no surfing at all.
Have you ever been there?
No.
But every time I hear this song, I want to go.
I know for a factyou did not break that leg making eggs.
I used to love sitting,and now that I have to, I hate it.
I should get home.
Ill drive you. Ill put the top up.
Thats okay. Ill hitch.
I do it all the time.
Youll get picked up by some creep.
I guess this is safer.
So, are you married or divorced?
Couldnt I just be single?
No. I mean, Id be surprised.
Im divorced.
Do you go on those dateswhere you sit there
and ask each other questions?
Its a means to an end.
But nobody knowswhats wrong with themselves,
and everyone else can see it right away.
-Thank you very much.-its my pleasure.
So, what times your flight tomorrow?
Noon.
Unless you think I should change it.
What are you doing?
I dont know.
Youre so beautiful and young.
Anna and Inever had a romantic relationship.
But you love her.
For lots of reasons.
And in a very different way.
I have to tell you something,
and I probably shouldnt.
I promised I wouldnt,
but I see you two together,and I know I have to.
Okay.
Anna is...
She has cancer-
-What?-its why she broke her leg.
Its in her bones. its all over her body.
Im sorry.
Cancer. Shit.
Im so sorry.
Of course shes not gonna say a damn thing.
She doesnt know.
What?
The doctors said she doesnt have long,so theres no reason to tell her.
Some quacks out in Pedro?What are you going to do about it?
My mom got a consultation.
Your mother does not get to decide that.
Please dont make me sorry that I told you.
I didnt want you to leave hereand not know.
Good morning.
I woke up in a panicbecause I thought I mightve missed you-
But it doesnt look like youre ready to go.
-I thought Id stay a little longer, if its okay.-Hell yes.
Stay as long as you want.
Well see.
If I had rolled over on this,I wouldve had to smoke the dress.
Howd you sleep?
I was feeling no pain, as they say.
In fact, I dont know if I wouldve woken upif I hadnt heard that jet fly by.
And I thought,"Oh, my God. Dick left already."
Theres all kinds of aircraft here, you know.
If we stay up tonight and we get lucky,well see something youll remember.
If we keep smoking that.
Ive seen UFOs.
There was a lot going onduring the m*ssile scare,
but it was different.
You saw a UFO?
You dont have to do that, you know.
I want to.
Im not gonna fight watching Dick Whitmanpaint my living room in his shorts.
Im so damn proud of you.
I count on it.
Does that scare you?
The idea of another civilizationon another planet
smart enough to find a way to get here?
It doesnt scare me,but the odds are against it.
Well, I saw something once,
and Im telling you, it knocked me sideways.
I started thinking of everythingI was sure was true
and how flimsy it all might be.
You dont need to see a UFO to know that.
Thats not a great way to think about things.
I know everything about you,and I still love you.
Are you just gonna paint that corner?
Cause a patch of new paintis just as bad as a stain.
What the hell is going on?
Youre gonna get arrested.
No, you are. Thats breaking and entering.
I thought you had a flight to catch.
I changed my plans.
You just cant keep your pants on, can you?
You never know whats gonna set her off.
-I need to talk to you.-I bet.
I heard your car pull up at 2:30.Shes half your age.
Whats your plan?
Just gonna let her wake up one day in agonyand you tell her its over?
Im going to assume
that youve done everythingin your limited means,
but Im here now.
Shes gonna see some real doctors,and shes not gonna live in the dark.
We showed the X-raysto specialists, everybody.
Its very advanced.
Specialists? You dont think she knowssomethings going on?
She had polio. Shes been going to doctorssince she was eight. Maybe...
I dont know.
She hasnt let on,so this is the way its gonna be.
I understand you feel guilty, but dont.
Go to Acapulco.Theres nothing for you to do here.
She is very important to me.
Im gonna do what I have to.
You have no say in the affairs of this family.
Youre just a man in a roomwith a checkbook. Im sorry.
Please do the decent thing.
The longer youre here,the more likely you are to say something.
She thinks you brought the pot, I bet.
If it wasnt for my niece,wed have k*ll each other by now.
She means well, and shes family.
I wouldnt have picked her.
Im just saying not everybody has that.
You have your kids. I bet thats better.
Its different.
I have to tell you something.
Whats wrong?
I have to go.
Im sorry.
I thought I could stay, but I cant.
I dont care.
I want you to.
I want you to do everything you want to do.
Ill bring the kids out at Easter.
Well go to Catalina, see the bison.
Acapulco.
Do you think theres more Mexicans hereor there?
Joan.
Open it.
Theyre beautiful.
Its so encouraging to see someonehappily married around here.
Peggy, why dont you go home?
Ill tell everyoneyou have something important to do.
Really? I have to buy a dress.
New Years Eve, big group of girls,youll want to stand out.
No, Im spending it with Mark.My boyfriend?
Happy New Year.
Excuse me.
-"Darling, Ive been an ass. Kisses, Lane"?-What?
I am not your darling,and I dont want your kisses.
-What?-I thought American men were bad enough,
but none of them has ever so consistently
made me feel likea helpless, stupid little girl.


Calm down. I did send you flowers,but I also sent flowers to my wife in London.
The sentiments were very different,I assure you. Sandy!
-Is everything okay?-Yes.
Just get back to work. Sandy!
Did it ever occur to youhow sensitive these deliveries were?
How often do I send flowers?
I ordered the flowers from Rhinelanders.
They assured me they were goingto contact your florist in London,
and somehow they mixed them up.Its not my fault.
Sandra, everyone makes mistakes,
but the fact that youre the kind of personwho cannot accept blame is egregious.
I dont know what that means.
It means I cant believe I hired you.
You had one simple task.
I dont even know if I can call to apologize.
What exactly did Mrs. Harris note say?
It said, "Joan, forgive me. Lane."
Youre fired. Go get your things.Youll be paid through the end of the year.
Those instructions you understood!
Ill have Megan clean this up.
What are you doing?
You inspired me.
Would you like to sign your work?
-Really?-Pick a spot on the wall.
You should swim as much as you can there.
Itll clear your head.
But no cliff diving.
Hey. Youll be fine.
Youll make the best of it. You always do.
You know you can call meif you need anything.
Goodbye, Anna.
Goodbye, Dick.
Mn Draper?
Mr. Draper?
-Happy New Year.-Happy New Year.
Hey, what are you doing up?
I figured since we missed it here,we could celebrate it in Hawaii.
Look at that.
Im sorry. I ate dinner at 3:00.
A bowl of cottage cheese in the cafeteria?
How about a glassof fresh-squeezed orange juice?
Sure.
The nurses spent five minutestrying to get this girls contact lenses out.
She was screaming.
It turns out her friend was the onewith the contact lenses.
God!
-Oh, God.-Let me see.
-I cut it really bad, Greg. It really hurts.-Jesus.
Hold this.
-Just take me to the hospital.-Sit down.
Greg, you dont have to do this.
Would you stop?
Isnt there some medical ethical lawagainst operating on your wife?
I want you to calm down.
For me, this is like,I dont know, filing some papers is for you.
I do it all the time.
I dont do that anymore.I have other people do that.
Its really throbbing. Let me get my coat.
Hey, since when have we hadthat birds nest on the ceiling?
I usually save that for kids.
Now, dont move.
One hillbilly says to the other,
"You wanna play 20 questions?"
The other hillbilly says, "What is that?"
He says,"I write something on a piece of paper,
"and you get 20 questionsto guess what it be."
So he takes out a piece of paperand writes "donkey dick" on it.
The other hillbilly takes a second to think
and asks, "Can I eat it?"
The other hillbilly says,"I might reckon you could."
The other one says,
"Is it donkey dick?"
Cohen told me that.
Come on. its fine.
Im not crying cause it hurts.
Everythings gonna be okay.
When?
Jeanie.
I cant fix anything else,
but I can fix this.
Hello?
Hello?
I thought you were in Acapulco.
I didnt feel like it.
You should be in England with your family.
Too much to do.Theyll be back soon enough.
I have a sandwich in the refrigerator.Its very large.
No, thank you. Do you mind?
Help yourself.
I received something rather specialfrom my father
-for my birthday.-What is it?
Who knows?
Hes one of those alcoholicswho thinks that hes collecting.
Chin-chin.
-Theres no...-No bite at all.
Well,
I will let you get back to your business.
I made a discoveryas I slowly pulled back from the records.
I cant take any more bad news, Lane.
Although things are precarious financially,
its been a magnificent year.
Lane!
-What?-Come here.
Were going to the movies.
-Do you think we should?-Does Howdy Doody have a wooden dick?
Zorba the Greek, seen it,but would see it again.
Its a Mad, Mad, Mad World. No kidding.
-Send Me No Flowers.-No.
The g*n of August.
I hate g*n and I hate August.
Its all over the rug.
Well have to smoke the dress.
Well, I dont know that one.
The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.
Catherine Deneuve.
Apparently, its for all the young loversof the world.
This movie is very good.
You know whats going on here, dont you?
-Handjobs.-ls that right?
What percentage do you think?
Do you mind?
Monster!
You like it here?
I do. I do. Even alone.
You remind me of a chap I knew in school.
We followed him around in a pack,and he didnt notice we were there.
He died in a motorcycle crash.
Rebecca convinced methat you were all on holiday together
without me.
I suppose we havent been very welcoming.
Campbells friendly,although I believe unintentionally.
But my wife is quite severe with people,including me.
Im sorry to hear that.
I wanted to bring our familiesto New York for the holidays,
but she was terribly homesick.
We had an argument, a series of arguments,and she left.
I then weakened and sent her flowers.
Tried to, anyway.
Then we had a rather solemn phone callin which she told me she was not returning.
Then she put my son on the phone.
Thats tough.
How did you know when you were done?
It wasnt my decision.
And Ive learned the hard waynot to give advice in these situations.
You were supposed to tell meto get on a plane.
Is that what you want?
Or is that what people expect of you?
I want my beef.
Here it is.
I was going to call a lady friend of mine.
Im supposed to meet her downtown.
Do you want her to bring a friend?
No, no. No, thank you.
What are you gonna do?
We can pretend its New Years. It actually is.
If you dont mind.
Its the least I can do.
-Im not hungry.-What?
Not hungryfor this beautiful piece of American meat?
Look at me!
I got a big Texas belt buckle!
Im thinking, "Did my mother get suspiciousand Call the fuzz?"
”We know youre practicing self-abuse.Please come out with your hand up. ”
I see we have an anniversary here tonight.
Look at these two, George and Martha.
Tell me, whats it like when your eyes meetacross a crowded men s room?
Wall Street, does it bother your parentsthat hes so ugly?
So we all want to knowat the end of the night,
when its just the two of you,who picks up the check?
Were not homosexuals! Were divorced!
Dont.
Man- Now theyre gonna fight in the carall the way home.
"Honey whyd you provoke the comedian?"
Okay, now welcomea talented young musician
whose mother says hes the next Bob Dylan.
-Candace, this is Lane.-And this is my friend Janine.
-Hello.-A pleasure.
I guess I was wrong. Youre not queers.Youre rich.
A warm welcome for Rudy Jensen.
-You ladies look lovely.-Why, thank you.
Its true.
I love this song.
-Really? He wrote it.-Dont. Shell believe anything.
What?
Lets get out of here.
You have no mixers at all and no food.
I love your apartment. Its very manly.
It came this way.I think Norman Mailer sh*t a deer over there.
I love deer.
Get your tail in here and help me.
She seems to know her way aroundin your kitchen.
Whats that like?
I told you I dont like giving advicein these situations.
Why dont you show me around?
I suppose I am a bit curious myself.
Not in there.

She does not go to Barnard.
Guys like him like that.
-Come on. Lets go in the other room.-No.

Fascinating.
Heres $30.
Well, I shall be running along.
Thank you for the welcome distraction.
Sorry.
All right. Gentlemen, shall we begin 1965?
