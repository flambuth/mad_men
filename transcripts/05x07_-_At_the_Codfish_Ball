No, it is absurd.
-I see you brought work with you.-It is my book.
I make an excuse of New Yorkto try and pubIish again.
Megans excited about it.
My daughter pretends to find interestingwhat I find interesting
because she Ioves me.
Why are you carrying the bags?Is Jonesy drunk again?
So...
PIease speak EngIish.
You Iike it?
I dont know. Its exquisiteIy decadent.
WeII, it kind of came this way.
No, it didnt.
EmiIe is confused.
His eyes and his poIitics are having a fight.

I have a beautifuI Dover soIe.
And I want you to be on vacation.
Save yourseIf.

HeIIo?

Now teII me aIIabout your adventures today.
HoId on, sweetheart. Its SaIIy.
Shes okay, but you shouId taIk to her.
So UncIe ArnoId, huh?
No one went to the funeraI,but I knew you aIways Iiked him.
Has Margaret stoppeddancing on Janes grave?
WeII, she hardIy hid her feeIings.
You didnt react that way.
No, but I have to admit
Im surprisedthat youre in such a good mood.
Its unsatisfying, actuaIIy.
I aIways thought shed Ieave you.
Ive been wondering IateIyif she was just an excuse
to bIow up my Iife.
Are you seeing a psychiatrist?
No.
But I did have a...
WeII, I had a Iife-aItering experience.
III bite.
Mona, I took LSD.
I went on a trip.
Of course you did.
You shouId reaIIy try it. You have to.Youd Iove it, actuaIIy.
So whats it Iike?
Euphoria and insight and...
I dont know. My whoIe Iife,peopIe have been teIIing me
I dont understand how other peopIe think.
And it turns out its true.
Maybe I shouId try it.
So, these are four membersof the American Cancer Society.
Theyre honoring Don for kickingLucky Strike in the baIIs with that Ietter.
IncredibIe.
And what am I supposed to dowith these names?
You remember when we were first marriedand you used to go to Iuncheons
and teII me about these powerfuI menthat I couId meet?
And you ignored me.
When I was in the deepest part of the trip,
the farthest away,
I was sitting in my bathtuband I saw myseIf at the 1 91 9 WorId Series.
I was pIaying.
You finaIIy got to be a basebaII pIayer.
Yeah, but why that game? Why that series?
Because thats when it went bad.
I just reaIized
nothing I had was minebecause the game was thrown.
Roger, pIease dont feeI guiItyabout your advantages.
I, for one, am not gonna Ieta bunch of dirty teenagers in the paper
disrupt the order of things.
Im not. Im trying to meet with Firestone.
Its a huge favor, I know.
But I Iost everythingwhen we Iost Lucky Strike.
I thought you married Janebecause I had gotten oId.
And then I reaIized it was because you had.
I havent had a heart attack since.
WeII, I dont see what the harm couId be.
You are stiII supporting aII of us.
Thank you.
Whatever you can find out by Friday.
Youd be surprised.
HeIIo?
Were in here.
SaIIy, Bobby, this is Dr. and Mrs. CaIvet.
-Marie.-EmiIe.
-HeIIo.-Hi.
Henrys mother broke her ankIe.
-Oh, my goodness.-Thats terribIe.
It couId have been a Iot worse.
SaIIy, you want to teII them what happened?
She tripped over one of Genes toys.
No, not that.
SaIIy caIIed the poIice,who caIIed an ambuIance.
And whiIe they were waiting...
SaIIy, go on.
I put her foot on a piIIowand put ice on it and kept her caIm.
-What a big girI.-This is wonderfuI.
SaIIy doesnt Iike fish.
WeII, as a reward, I made spaghetti.
I aIways made Megan spaghetti.
That was her very favorite.
So, you two wiII stay in the boys room.
We cant put EmiIe and Mariein the bunk beds.
I apoIogize, but we had a Iong voyage.
Good night, everyone.
Do you give a Iot of shots?
I am not a medicaI doctor. I am a professor.
When you have a high degree in any fieId,they caII you a doctor.
Its from the MiddIe Ages.
Thats right.
Let me just make sure Mom got settIed in.
So, is Mr. Heinz a down-to-earth
kind of steeI-town, German-PoIish,drinks-beer-out-of-a-can kind of guy?
No, hes boring. Hes got a daughter.
I think thats where he getsaII his shitty ideas.
Who finished the shrimp?
-I asked.-You stiII hungry?
Shes got to watch herseIf.
Too much Chineseand weII have to go up a cup size.
-Shut up.-What are you taIking about?
Weve been working on PIaytex.
Peggys got a way with the equipment.
Id Iove your opinion on this, Abe.
Peggy, a traditionaIist in the bosom arena,
beIieves that we shouId seII sexy brasto oId Iadies,
whereas I think we shouId seII aduIt brasto young girIs.
Abe agrees with me. So does Don.
WeII, its not fair that justbecause youre a boob-carrying consumer
that your opinion means more.
You know what? I shouId take off.Ive got a deadIine.
And, honestIy, I didnt have enough dinner.
-I shouId go home.-Okay.
-III caII you in the morning.-Good night.
Hes too good-Iooking for you.
My father wont careif he finds out you read James Bond.
You know what? This is a good book.
You shouId read it.
Your father saidtheyII sightsee with the kids during the day
and watch themwhen we go out with Heinz tomorrow night.
YouII have to give me some cash.
He wont even buy himseIf a pretzeI.
And they can watch themthe night of the cancer dinner.
Thats the whoIe reason they came down,to see you get the award.
They came to see you.
And your fathers got a meetingwith some pubIishers.
One pubIisher. WeII caII the sitter.
Francis the TaIking MuIe?
Dont you want them to come?
I dont thinkanythings gonna make him Iike me.
Because Im his favorite.
Why do you think my motheris so competitive?
I didnt see that.
Didnt you notice she touched you six timesin an hour?
Shes French.
No, thats not what that is.
WeII...
Good night.
TheyII be gone Sunday.
Do you have a minute?
Lock that and get Dawn to hoId my caIIsand you can have five.
No, pervert. This is about work.
I think it is, anyway.
I think I have an idea.
It might be reaIIy good.
But it might be terribIe.
WeII, youve estabIisheda firm bed of insecurity.
Okay.
Last nightwhen I was feeding the kids spaghetti,
I reaIized that my mother had made it for meand that her mother had made it for her.
And I got this picture in my headof her becoming me,
Iike with one of those movie dissoIves.
And then this morning in the shower,
I reaIized you couId take it aII the way back
to cavemen and then do the MiddIe Ages,the Renaissance, aII the way up to now.
And then the future,
Iike a coIony on the moonand you see Earth out the window.
Thats very good.
But we dont seII spaghetti.
No, Heinz Baked Beans.
It soIves a Iot of probIems, doesnt it?
My God.
Get over here.
No, I dont want to change the subject.
Im not changing the subject.
What are we showing tomorrow?
Human cannonbaII.
I mean, its funny and I Ioved it, but...
Dawn, get Stanand Ginsberg in here right away.
Theyre gonna hate me.TeII them it was your idea.
You dont reaIIy want me to do that, do you?
No.
"Kids want beans and they have forever."
I had something Iike,
"Heinz Beans, some things never change."
Jesus, I think thats better.
-You rang?-Im gonna need both of you on Surrette.
Were changing Heinz.
Mr. Drexler for you.
Thank you, Patricia. HeIIo?
Hows Minetta Tavern sound for dinner?
Its Thursday. Not good.
Youre gonna eat anyway.
WeII, come by.
Im not coming by. I cant taIk to you thereand I dont want to wait.
Okay.
I couId meet you earIy if I come back. 6:00?
7:00. III see you there.
She couIdnt have been struck by Iightninga week ago?
You think thats her idea?
What happened?
Boss wife had an idea.
Is it any good?
Its better than what we had.
Good for her.
Come in.
Im supposed to bein the finaI mix for Vicks tonight
and I need to switch it. Its very important.
Youre the one who scheduIed it.
I have something eIse to do.
WeII, that aImost never happens,so dont feeI bad.
It doesnt, does it?
Can I have a cigarette?
Joan?
Do you want to cIose the door?
I thought everything was going great,
but now I have this terribIe feeIingabout Abe.
I think hes gonna end it.
Why?
He wants to have dinnerand he knows weeknights are hard.
And we just saw each other Iast night.
And he wouIdnt take no for an answer.
WeII, its been my experience
that when a man insists on a meaI,he has something important to say.
Its usuaIIy a proposaI.
ReaIIy?
WeII, thats you.
Men dont take the time to end things.
They ignore youuntiI you insist on a decIaration of hate.
Someone dumped you?
Peggy, Im just Iike everybody eIse.
If hes going to end it, which I doubt,youII know what to do.
If hes going to propose,youd better have your answer prepared,
especiaIIy if its no.
Gosh.
I shouId go home and change, shouIdnt I?
Or better yet, go shopping.
So the moms wearingthe gIass space heImet
and the kid took his offand put it on the tabIe?
That way, the kid can eat the beans.
And I thought you couId do the whoIe thing
with the same actorspIaying mother and chiId.
Mr. Sterlings here to see you.
You two are actuaIIy working.
Go break it into framesand have Stan draw it up.
Ive been working this morning, too.
You mean you finished yours,youre moving onto mine?
No, Ive been in the w*r room, Don,
preparing for the American Cancer Dinner.
CaroIine went to the Iibraryand got me pictures of these guys.
Im $50 away from a seating chart.
Look, I dont take this honor IightIy.
Good. Say something Iike that.
Titans of industry are giving you an award.
We are being Iowered in a bucketinto a goId mine.
Im gonna bring my pickand crack something off the waII.
I dont think its that kind of atmosphere.
You actuaIIy saying thatwith a straight face?
You forget why you wrote that Ietter?
Are you forgettingyou said it wouId kiII our business?
So you think cigarettes are badand so are the peopIe who seII them?
Its what they think.
Mary Laskerand the rest of them know it as the truth.
It doesnt matter why I wrote it.
Youre right.
Who knows why peopIein history did good things?
For aII we know, Jesus was tryingto get the Ioaves and fishes account.
III do what I can,but Im not gonna go overboard.
My in-Iaws dont think Im Jesus.
TheyII be cIapping and cheering.They dont know youre a hypocrite.
Megans father is a communist.
What?
Hes a sociaIist or a Maoist or some ideoIogythat makes him hate me and what I do.
PIus, you know,Im sIeeping with his daughter.
So heII see you shaking hands.
You know, its very interesting,
but a Iot of times you thinkpeopIe are Iooking at you,
but theyre not. Their minds eIsewhere.
Lots of peopIe that havent taken LSDaIready know that, Roger.
Youre gonna be Iike an ItaIian bride.
PeopIe Iining up to give you enveIopes.
-You Iook good.-Thank you.
The steak is supposed to be good here.
The menus huge.
The service is incredibIe,but I toId them to Ieave us aIone a second.
Can I get a drink?
Yeah, sure.I guess I can get somebodys attention.
No. Forget it.
What do you want to say?
Okay.
Ive been thinking about this.
Were at a pIacewhere we Iove being together.
It aIways seems to besome kind of pain in the ass
to be in the same pIacewhen the Iights go out.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, weII,I think we shouId move in together.
I mean, how wouId we ever do that?
WeII, however you want.
I mean, I think your pIace wouId be better.
Its because thats how I feeI.
I just Iike the idea of the two of uswaking up in the same pIace every day.
The two of us writing togetherin the same room,
Iooking at each other every once in a whiIe.
Grocery shopping.
Look, I know its a big decision.
So you dont haveto say yes or no right now.
Maybe we shouId order.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Youve made me so happy.
Me, too.
You stiII want to eat?
I do.
ActuaIIy, my father is on the boardof the American Cancer Society,
aIthough he said the votingwas unanimous for Don.
WeII, that is quite an honor.
And as muchas we appreciate the invitation,
were heading back to Pittsburghthe minute I Ieave your office smiIing.
Youre reaIIy gonna rush off?
I think Ken got you ticketsto the new Edward AIbee pIay.
We saw it on Tuesday.
You did?
Yeah, we came in a coupIe days earIy.
AIice Ioves the city. Did I not mention that?
No reason to, I guess.
Raymond, wouId you order me a Sanka?Im gonna freshen up.
And some dessert.
Come on, why not?
You know, Ive aIways wanted to eat here.
I thought it wasjust for Time Life empIoyees.
You know,I reaIIy enjoy spending time with you.
I feeI the same way, AIice.
Im onIy saying this because Raymondsputting on such a good show.
He didnt want to go to dinner.
He just wanted to do it in your office.
Hes a good man, I swear.
Of course he is.
I was reaIIy prepared to not Iike you,
but youre so good for that manand youre so IiveIy.
-Thank you, AIice.-Im just saying
I hope we can continue to be friends.
No, see, the truthin packaging biII they wanted to pass
wouId hit everybody hard,but now theres no teeth.
So nothing shouId change.
Were getting fired.
Sorry, but we ended up getting more dessertthan we bargained for.
Whos up for a nightcap?
Thats okay. I think were gonna turn in.
Do me the favor, Raymond.
You dont know this, but youve rescued mefrom a house fuII of in-Iaws and chiIdren.
Can we get a bottIe of Sauternesand six gIasses?
I dont know. We have the earIy meetingtomorrow and the fIight back.
You know, Don jokesabout having a house fuII of peopIe,
but he Ioves it.
Don?
Don, teII him about Iast night.
WeII, we had three generationsunder one roof,
Megan, her mother and my 1 2-year-oId SaIIy.
SaIIy wont eat anything,as you might imagine.
Except beans, of course.
Its true.
They do Iike them.Never had any worries about that.
You shouId have seen it.
Megan bringing the pot in,spooning them out on the pIate,
her mother was smiIing.
What a darIing scene.
ActuaIIy, I didnt knowif I had done something wrong
because Don was staring at us.
But apparentIy Id given him this idea.
She did.
Don, you sure you wantto taIk about this now?
Let him taIk.
ObviousIy theres more to it,
but I think it wouId be a seriesof one-shot IittIe movies.
One mother starting in the prehistoric caves
serving beans to a shaggy IittIe boyby the fire.
Then a Greek woman
in a toga with a IittIe shepherd boy.
Then Marie-Antoinette to a IittIe prince.
CaIamity Jane to a pioneer boy.
AII the way through the gay 90s to today,
in a kitchen Iike yours.
WouId it aII be the same mother and chiId?
We hadnt thought of that,but that might work.
TeII him the rest of it.
WeII, it goes past, present day to the future,
to a IittIe Iunar kitchenwith the Earth off in the window.
You know, futuristic cIothing,interesting bowIs.
The kid has just taken off his space heImetas he takes a warm bite.
Thats cIever.
That was Megans idea.
When Don toId me, I thought,
were aII so busy and we rush aroundand it wiII probabIy aIways be Iike that.
But a mother and chiId and dinner,
thatII never change.
"Heinz Beans,
"some things never change."
Can I get some more coffee?
I dont know what to say.
Let me think about it. See the pictures.
Raymond, reaIIy? Its beautifuI.And its exactIy...
I dont know. Can I get the cream, pIease?
WeII, we were dancing arounda few other things, too.
No, we werent.This is what youre gonna see tomorrow.
Its a once-in-a-Iifetime idea.
Raymond, you couId save yourseIf a tripto the office tomorrow
or we can get in the eIevator,go down 1 1 fIoors
and show you the work right now.
Its the future.
Thats aII I ever wanted.
ShouId we changethat Sauternes to champagne?
Sure, why the heII not?
72nd and Park.
Do you know youre good at aII of it?
You had the idea, feeding me the pitch,knowing to puII the trigger at that moment.
I was just gonna scream in his stupid face.
Im gIad you didnt.
I Iove the way you soId that.
Oh, my God.
I want you.
But we have to go back to the housewith the kids and your parents.
We can go back to the office.
Change of pIans. Back to Time-Life, pIease.
Theres champagne in the conference room.
Don and Megan soId HeinzIast night over dinner.


But, by Iooking at your fingers,maybe youre not in the mood to ceIebrate.
No, of course.
It was better than that.
ReaIIy?
Were moving in together.
He asked me.
Shacking up?
My goodness.
I know, but...
No, Peggy.
Good for you.
ReaIIy?
Youre not just saying that?
No.
I dont know.
Sounds Iike he wants to be with youno matter what.
I thought you were goingto be disappointed for me.
I think its very romantic.
It is, isnt it?
We dont need a piece of paper.
I mean, not that marriageis wrong or anything.
Greg has a piece of paper with the US Army
thats more importantthan the one he has with me.
Im sorry.
It is what it is.
I think youre brave.
I think its a beautifuI statement.CongratuIations.
So Megan comes out and doesa doubIe secret reverse to Don that its over.
Then they just passed it back and forthIike a coupIe of pros.
You werent even there.
Way to go.
You shouId be shaking her hand.
Its just beginners Iuck.
So, the Hemisphere CIub...
-Im gonna go teII Peggy.-TeII everybody.
You want the pIeasure of teIIing Lane?
No, you earned it.
Besides, were stiII at Ieast 1 5 grandout of pocket on the account.
Megan! CongratuIations.
-You heard.-Yeah.
Joan toId me Harry said you signed Heinz.
I dont want to take aII the credit.
Why arent you jumping up and down?
I dont know whatthe Canadian equivaIent of basebaII is,
but this is a home run.
We have basebaII.
WeII, this is a home run.
I know what you did, and it is a big deaI.
And when it happened to me,they acted Iike it happens aII the time.
It doesnt.
I tried to crack that nut.
I mean, if anything, I shouId be jeaIous.
But I Iook at you and I feeI Iike,
I dont know,Im getting to experience my first time again.
Its a good day for me.
This is as good as this job gets.
Savor it.
Youre right. I wiII.
Good morning, EmiIe. Where is everyone?
The girIs went out and Bobby is heIping mefiII my fountain pen.
Thanks, EmiIe.

Its not as bad as you think,but its pretty bad.
-SaIIy.-Go ahead.
Papa, can I come with youto see you get your award tonight?
Papa?
I dont know.
I got a dress. PIease?
Every daughter shouId getto see her father as a success.
Its fine.
Sweetheart, of course you can go.
Thank you, Daddy.Can I show you my dress?
Bobby, put that away.You two watch TV or something.
What was that about?
My father went to his pubIisher this morningand was back within the hour.
And then he got on the phonewith CIaudette,
his Iatest grad student.
My mother waIked in.He was crying, apparentIy.
WeII, hes got a Iot wrapped up in that book.
He shouId be crying to my mother, Don.
Right.

They do this aII the time.TheyII recover. They aIways do.
Honey, its reaIIy hot.
Wait.
Hi, Ma. Come in.

Can I get you a drink?
No. I mean, yes.
But does anyone knowhow to tie this thing?
Here.
Im stag tonightand my doorman wears a cIip-on.
I am surprised.
You seem Iike you were born in a bow tie.
I didnt tie that one either.
Good evening, everyone.
My God.
SaIIy, you Iook so beautifuI.
Youre beautifuI, sweetheart.
Don, there is nothing you can do.
No matter what, one day your IittIe girIwiII spread her Iegs and fIy away.
What? Its true.
"Wings," Daddy.
Take off the makeup and the boots.
What? No.
Or you can stay home.
Fine.

So I manage those accounts.
I dont understand.What do you do every day?
WeII, what do you do?
Youre a schoIar and an inteIIectuaI, right?
Yes.
ActuaIIy, from what I hear,youre a bit of a traiIbIazer.
I dont know if thats true.
I bet the worId wouId be better offif they knew about the work youre doing.
You are very kind.
That, EmiIe,

Shit. Ive got to b*at the entrée. Cover me.
Your date is very resourcefuI.
PIease. I got this.
Im sorry, honey.I wasnt gonna Ieave before dessert,

ReaIIy?
Abe and I are very serious about each other
and weve decidedwere going to Iive together.
What?
Listen. I know you may not approve,
but its important to me that you understandwhat were doing.
I wiII take very good care of her.
You know what?
Im gonna go.

Im gonna go.
I need my cake.
Why?
Because Im not giving you a caketo ceIebrate youse Iiving in sin.
WouId you rather I not teII you?
Yeah. You want to stick it in my face?
Just Iie. You think youre the first ones everto do this?
-Ma.-What do you want from me?
Im gonna get you a cab.
I invited you here as an aduIt
because I didnt want to Iieand I want you in my Iife.
WeII, if youre an aduIt,why do you care what I think?
I thought youd be reIievedI wasnt marrying the Jew.
It has nothing to do with that!
Its my fauIt.
Because once your father died,there was no one to set you straight.
I know what Im doing.
And I think Daddy wouId want meto be happy.
No. Hed be mad at you the same way I am,
because you are seIIing yourseIf short.
This boy, he wiII use you for practice
untiI he decides to get marriedand have a famiIy.
And he wiII, beIieve me.
You want me to be aIone?
You know what your aunt used to say?
"Youre IoneIy, get a cat."

Then youre done.
Thank you for dinner.
AII of us hereappreciate your years of service.

Youre wrecking the speeches.
Youre a mean drunk. You know that?
From the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryceadvertising firm...
-Your daddys next.-...Mr. Donald Draper.
Thank you.
ShouIdnt I be at his side?
Go get em, tiger.
Can I see it?
Do you want it?
No, you shouId keep itbecause it makes you reaIIy happy.
You know what makes me happy?
A beautifuI young Iady who wiII somedaybe wearing makeup, but not today.
I got you a ShirIey TempIe.
Its time to start tapering off.
And, Don, I promised Frankfrom Ford over there youd come and say hi.
Id buy you a drink,but I think theyre stiII free.
I have been watching you aII night.
Youre so fuII of Iife and ambition.
WeII, Ive gotten a Iot of rejection,so who knows what Im fuII of?
When I was younger,it was my spirit to try everything,
get a taste, know what was what,
and never be sorry for making the mistakes.
And then one day,I made too many mistakes.
Where was I that day?
Inside you is a IittIe boy.
