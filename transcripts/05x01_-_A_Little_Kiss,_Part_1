O-wee-o, o-wee-o.
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?
Shut up!
Get a job!
Somebody call the cops?
Thats all there is,cops, and negroes, and priests.
Youre walking in a circle.
It must be hot out there.
What are you doing?
You hit one.
Hey, watch the work.
To the mens room.
Less promises, more money!
Do you know somebodysthrowing water b*mb out your windows?
What are you talking about?
Everybody saw it was comingfrom this floor.
We all saw it.
This is the executive floor.Thats utterly ridiculous.
Dont you call us ridiculous.
Is this what Madison Avenue represents?
And they call us savages.
What are you doing up?
I thought this was the bathroom.
Its down there.
Okay.
You want breakfast?
Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you.
We should wait for his cake.
Were not gonna be hereon his actual birthday.
Thank you.
Its from all of us.
Well go to the deli for dinner tonightand have cherry cheesecake.
Open it now.
Yes, maam.
- Can I turn the bacon?- No.
I love it.
- Good morning, everybody.- Morning.
- Hi, Megan.- Hi.
Thats so nice.
He needs one of those.
Its a badger, from its tail.
- What are we doing today?- Were going to the Statue of Liberty.
You always say that, but we never do.
You hungry?
Just black coffee for me.
Okay, everybody.
Have a happy birthday.
Thank you, Sals.
How old are you gonna be?
Forty.
So, when youre 40, how old will I be?
Youll be dead.
Were not gonna see you next weekend,
but well see you the weekend after.
- Thats the 11th.- If you say so.
Youll be 70.
Thats right.
Youre not gonna come in?
No, but give Morticia and Lurch my love.
Flick the porch lightwhen you get there, all right?
- AII right.- Good night, animals.
Say good night, honey.
Good night, Daddy.
Get your brothers hand.
Bye.
Youre losing your head there.
Dandruff.
Its spit-up.
I saw your wife dropping you off.
Such a sweet scene.
Yes.
She has quite a smile.
Shes getting back to herself.
How old is the kid?
I thought it would be a little faster.
Does she cry all the time?
No.
She just...
There was a time when she wouldntleave the house in a robe.
Listen, theres a point
when you go from going homeon the 5:25 to the 7:05.
If you finally learn how to drive,you can push it to 9:30.
Youre getting the wrong impression.
Or not come home at all.
Beth and I got into it so badthe other night,
I just jumped in the car and drove.
Made it all the wayto some motel in Rocky Hill.
Put my fist through a wall.
Howard, dont get emotional again.
Maybe shes right.
Maybe I am a little selfish.
I said I needed time with my thoughts.
She asked me what I do at work all day.
They dont understand.
Greenwich. Next stop,Greenwich, Port Chester, Rye...
Who am I kidding?Its nothing a little peace wouldnt fix.
There you go.
Morning.
Of course. Ill let him know.
- Was that for me?- No.
- Who was it?- Really?
Fine. Whats Don up to today?
I see a lot of napping and pillow talk.
Thats your schedule.
You all had the status meeting20 minutes ago.
Cant you sit over there once in a while?
What if I have someoneimportant coming in?
When you have somebody come in,I will sit over there.
Here, why dont you buy yourself
a fancy hat or a mask or something?
No, thank you.
AII Im asking for is a few hours a day
where the world might mistake youfor my secretary.
Joan said you were supposed to share.
And his phone rings more.
Joans not here.And you just took $50 from me.
Let your conscience be your guide.
That feels good.
That feels so much better.
Yeah.
I was right. Somebody was very wet.
When you were that size,I used to change you every hour
whether you needed it or not.
I dont know how many timesI have to say this.
Those go in the cabinet in the hallway.
Im sorry.
I thought itd be easierif they were near your bathroom.
I didnt mean it that way.
I havent slept.
And I just feel cooped up in here.
I think its bad for Kevin to be out thereuntil Im done cleaning the oven, the fumes.
I dont know why you had to do thaton a hot summer day.
Anyway, I think were aboutto run out of formula.
Ill get your purse.
Hello.
Hello, you. Were gonna take a nap.Would you like that?
You want to lay in the bed with Mommy?
A ten?
You buying his formula or yours?
Ill take him for a walk.
Oh, God, would you?
Youre gonna go with Grandma Gail.Thats where youre gonna go.
Close the door.
How was everybodys weekend?
Great. We all went waterskiing together.
- Made a human pyramid.- I was here.
Splendid. So, I trust youre adequatelyprepared for the Heinz presentation.
Yes, boss. We have almost everything.
Just short Mrs. Drapers work.Shes writing the coupons.
Has Don signed off?
Hes late, and so is she, coincidently.
Clara.
Clara!
She should have just rolled over and said,"Don, what do you think of this?"
I bet she says that every morning.
Come on, its 11:00.
- No sunbathing?- No.
Look, we had a three-day weekendand you didnt do anything?
Thats not my calendar.
Clara.
How was your weekend?
- Clara, is Mr. Draper in yet?- No.
Youre late for the status meeting.
You should probably go prepareinstead of molesting my secretary.
Well, sweetheart, the tortures over.Let the fun begin.
My office is 30 yards away.
So when I hit that buzzer,Im trying to save myself
a trip through the miracle of telephonics.
Mr. and Mrs. Draper are here.
- Good morning.- So sorry, we overslept.
Thats not true. I did.
How was Memorial Day?
It was nice. We had my kids.
You had the status meeting at 10:00.
- Morning.- Good morning.
Did you read about Y&Rs paper bag drop?
I did.
- I dont see the humor.- Its funny.
I mean, if nothing else,it serves them right for stealing Ponds.
And what does one thinghave to do with the other?
They stole the Ponds account,and now theyre a laughingstock.
Makes me feel better.
Gentlemen, shall we mosey on overto the conference room?
We did have a meeting at 10:00.
Morning, Lane, clipboard.
We should run a want adsaying something like,
"Sterling Cooper,an equal opportunity employer."
"Our windows dont open."
As tempting as it sounds,
I dont know if we need to bespending money
to further their embarrassment.
Look, if theres no line itemfor humiliating the competition,
Don will write it and Ill pay for it.
But youre not allowed to read it.
Forget the want ads.The advertising column.
I want them to see it.
So, Heinz is coming in. Don?
Yes. Caroline, can you get Meganand the Heinz boards, please?
- Do you want the team?- No.
- What else?- Status is status quo on my end.
Im supposed to have drinkswith Bruce Lewis from Oldsmobile.
He wants to knowif theres a way around Nader.
There isnt. Anything else?
Lane?
I have a lunch at the 4As,
so I should be back in time,but not necessarily conscious.
And according to the memo,Kenny finally has signatures
from Chevalier, Galone, and Butler Shoes.
Footwear. AII good news.
I suppose that bringsthis meeting to a close.
Don, may I speak with you privately?
I should take a look at these right away.
Mr. Campbell.
I have a call of nature.
Do not begin this meeting without me.
When is he free next?
You obviously havent seen my coupons yet.
- Lets get out of here.- No.
Then lock the door.
As soon as Im in herelonger than five minutes,
people will start to...
What? Who?
I have to get these to Peggy.
You have a presentation, you know.
I could make you go home right now,you know. I have that power.
Mr. Campbell is here to see you.
I just saw him.
I have to get back to work.
Open your blouse.
Youre a dirty old man.
- Anything else?- No, maam.
Im sorry. Am I interrupting?
I asked for your first available meeting,
and it turns outyou have nothing to do today.
If you could have any client in the world,who would you want?
- American Airlines.- Why?
- Because they stood us up.- Right.
So, I started thinking,who has those feelings about us?
Mohawk Airlines.
You were very close.
The companys in a lot of trouble.
Its very nice that things have not gone wellsince we cut them loose.
They want to come back?
After the way we treated them...
So, that American Airlines thingisnt happening?
- I, for one, am very excited.- Oh, me, too.
I just dont understandthe secrecy or the urgency.
Im meeting with them today,and I think you should drop by.
Hank Lammott hit me pretty hardon his way out the door.
I may not help.
Don, youre the big draw.
Theyre not going to ask for someone else.
Look, get through this,get them back for more,
and Ill make time in my busy schedule.
Got it.Ill let you know when I need you to...
Its a good idea.
Can I get some coffee?
Oh, Megan, youre here.
I took a risk on one of them."Two for 22 cents."
Nice.
Of course, were really locked intothe five-cents off, but good thinking.
Stan, can you do something to these?
Like what?
I dont know.
Do that thing with the borderaround the edge,
so it kind of looks like legal tender,
with the can of beanswhere Washington goes.
You want me to put a little wig on him?
Play with it.
Drop dead.
Keep asking me to bemore and more specific
until youre drawing it yourself.
- Do you want me to move?- Oh, no, no.
- Im just looking for gum.- Oh, I have some.
So, I have to ask your opinionabout something.
You did a great job,
but I cant really go overboard on coupons.
I did that kind of baloney for two years.
You should take comfort in the factthat its very important to the client.
Too important.
No, its something else.
Tomorrows Dons birthday.
Oh, shit. Its June 1 st?
I forgot.
Got to get him something.
I still havent gotten youa wedding present.
Sorry. You know how busy Ive been.
No, its just...
Im throwing a party for him on Saturday.
Its a surprise.
Oh, okay.
For Don?
Yes.
Men hate surprises.
Didnt you have Lucy in Canada?
Look, nobody likes it in theory,but people are always glad.
And youve never seen me throw a party.
Everyones going to go home from thisand theyre gonna have sex.
Okay.
Sounds like fun for us at least.
I mean, if Im invited.I dont want to assume.
Youre invited. Im not sure who else is.
I went through his Rolodex.
I crossed out all the clientsand everyone hes fired.
That doesnt leave a lot of people.
Freddy Rumsen doesnt come to parties.
You have to invite Harry.
I know, but he really doesnt like him.
Really?
I didnt say anything.
- Frank Keller, his accountant?- He likes him.
There are six phone numbersfor Herman Phillips.
- Is he important?- Thats Duck.
What birthday is it?
Howd he do?
He was fussy the whole time.
But the elevator always knocks him out.
It must be the vibration.
Who would have thoughtyoud be so good at this?
Youll be good at it, too, sweetheart.
What am I going to do when you go home?
Are you really going back to that office?
- You worked.- I had to.
Your husbands a doctor.
It doesnt matter.
I promised, and they need me.
Im not saying youre not important to them,
but they also know that priorities change.
- They should, anyway.- Why are you doing this?
You dont knowhow sick youre going to feel inside
or what youre going to miss.
What hes doing now, thats nothing.
- Just wait.- I know, I know.
I just...
I dont want to break my promise.
And Greg will be stationedat Fort Dix for a second year.
I can commute from New Jersey.
And then?
And then, when hes done,
well see.
Joan, hes not going to allow you to work.
Allow me?
Whither thou goest, I will go.
And how did that work out for you?
Pete Campbell. Late as usual.
He obviously didnt come inon a Mohawk plane.
Hank. Jack.
Youre not late.Roger told us to come early.
Have a seat. Youre only one behind,but theyre nuclear.
Roger, theyre looking for youback in the office.
Itll keep.
We were just laughing about Y&R.
It couldnt have happenedto a better bunch of bigots.
Roger, its an emergency.
Really?
Oh, come on. We just got started.
AII right, all right. Sorry, fellas.
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.
You dont want me to fly copilotor be your wingman?
Check your valises?Hold your airsickness bag?
Do you want me to throw oneinto the bag youre in?
You enjoy yourself, then.Garçon, assume that these are gone.
I should warn you about these two.Theyre a thirsty lot.
Always a pleasure.
When youre done with him, just fold him upand slide him under the door.
I love that guy.
And so we take advantageof this new microphotography
and high-speed camera to show...
A bean ballet.
Spinning in airwith their delicious perfection,
the beans pirouette in slow motion,they somersault in slow motion.
Some of them spin clockwise,some counter-clockwise
so theyll appear to bemoving towards each other.
Until...
They drop into a full can,first seen from the top.
Theres a splash of mouth-watering sauceas each one lands.
Then we cut to the front, the iconic label.
"The art of supper."
Have you done this before,this special photography?
Its been done before,but youll be the first on TV.
How do they get the beans to do that?They cant just get lucky.
This camera can showa b*llet spinning in midair.
Wheres the bite and smile?
Ken, you said thered bea bite and smile on the phone.
I think I said there was goingto be a bean ballet, Raymond,
but Im sure we can add that.
And what do they take away from it?
It puts beans on their mind.
Its an unforgettable image.And believe it or not, it makes them exciting.
And itll show you have a sense of humor
because, really, theyre being portrayedas far more important than they are.
You ever see beans up close?
Theyre slimy.They look like a bunch of bloody organs.
And its not just for fellas like methat saw things in Korea.
Kidney beans are called kidney beansbecause theyre shaped that way.
But you could call all beans that.
They look better in a group, in a bowl.
Hell, whats wrong with a spoon?
Don.
- Well, hello, Don.- Hello, Raymond.
Good to see you.Are you as excited about this as we are?
I dont know.
You said to be bold.Nothing on TV is going to look like this.
And just imagine seeing one ofthese dancing beans on the subway wall.
People will hear the music in their heads.
Look, its very artistic.
And I want to be bold,
but this isnt what I had in mind
when I was talking abouta new generation of consumers.
The ketchup kids,are they even going to notice this?
I mean, that waltz alonereminds me of old people.
Maybe I wasnt clear.
This is temporary music. We can change it.
Its got no message.
I can see your point.
Beans...
Is the w*r, the Depression, b*mb shelters.
We have to erase that.
They have to be cool.Don, you know what Im talking about.
I want the kids in college.
Its convenient. They have the hot plate.Theyre sitting in.
Okay. Well work on that.
Maybe its someone with a picket signsaying, "We want beans."
You know what, Raymond?This is ourjob from here on out.
Well make you happy.
Im really sorry about that.
Please, this is a process.
Let me walk you out.
What else you got?
That was the best thing so far.
Unless you like this beans protest.
Please, you cant be surprised that,that man doesnt have a taste for ballet.
Its a joke on ballet.
And you cant be surprisedhe doesnt have a sense of humor.
Im not, but I guessI thought youd come in here
and tell them how good it was.
Do I really want to waste an hour and a halfshoving it down his throat,
only to have him pull the plugat the last minute?
This is businessthat came in over the transom.
We didnt pitch it.
He has every right to make us work for it.
I wish I would have known that.I would have saved this for round two.
Well get him next time.
Caroline.
Is he in?
Hes gone for the day.
Damn it. Clara.
Clara!
Oh, my goodness. What happened?
- You want me to get some tissue?- No.
I want you to tell mewhy Roger Sterling was at my meeting.
- I dont know.- I know.
Because he hovers over your desklike a damn U-2.
- What?- You think hes looking at your breasts?
Hes looking at my calendar.
- Did she hit you?- Thank you, Clara.
Youve done enough damage for today.
You need to lower your voice. Have a drink.
No, no more drinks.
Heinz looked miserable.
Theyre making us work for it.Don didnt seem worried.
Did you crash with Mohawk?
No, it was perfect.
Except for my deep nauseaand impending headache.
Oh, and Roger made an appearance.
Well, that shows its a good lead.
Its my lead.
Wasnt Roger in the servicewith Henry Lammott?
Did you do any rowing?
- You rowed?- I was a coxswain.
The boat moves becauseeveryone pulls in the same direction.
Im not supposed to worry about Roger.Im supposed to worry about other agencies.
You shouldnt be worried at all.Business is stable.
Stable is that step backwardsbetween successful and failing.
Fine, Pete.
Just dont be impatient.
You know how this works from here on out.
We start with a bunch of piddly shit,
your Topaz, your White Knight Cologne,
we add your mid-sized stuff,maybe Mohawk.
We still got Vicks, thats big.
Next, we worm our wayinto a few niche companies,
get something sexyin a good neighborhood,
a pharmaceutical.
Maybe if God is gracious, a car.
And then, we go public.
Open an office in Buenos Aires,
and Elvis plays at Tammys sweet 16.
Kenny Cosgrove writesanother great American novel.
You know it didnt hurtto have Roger warm them up.
Theres no one betterat turning a meeting into a bender.
And they love his pickled guts.
Am I going to see youat Chez Draper on Saturday?
I wish I could get overtime for it.
You ready?
Were almost done, actually.
Do you need her?
No, its okay. Itll be here in the morning.
Great.
Big weekend plans?
Its Tuesday. I dont know.
I was talking about me.My cousins coming in.
Stan, assume that youre working.
Good night.
Youre amazing.
It could have been worse.
I almost said, "Imsorry I cant make it."
Youre not going?
No, my cousins on shore leave.Hes only got two days.
A little notice would have been nice.
I would have loved to have seenthe look on Dons face.
You almost just saw it.
Like we have nothing else to do.
Did you believe him in there?
The guy didnt like it.What was he supposed to say?
What he usually says.
"Hey, buddy, you got such great ideas,open your own agency."
The clients are right all of a sudden?I dont recognize that man.
Hes kind and patient.
And it galls you.
No, it concerns me.
Where are you going?
Ive got tickets to the bean balletand the curtains about to go up.
Never gets old.
Youre home late.
I thought I was goingto have to walk home from the station,
but luckily there wasa cab driver leaving a bar.
How was your day?
I didnt want to disturb you.
This becomes a homethe minute you walk through that door.
Theres no fruit to my labor, Tweety.
Well, I suppose none of this counts.
An acre of land, a wife, a child.
That has nothing to do with work.
Im ungrateful.
Im sorry.
Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition.
Its the coal that fuels the fire.You know that.
Do you really want a dog?
Maybe just a beagle to scare off gophers.
Well see.
Oh, luckily my parentscan baby-sit Saturday.
Now, tell me the truth.Did Megan really just invite you today?
She did. I dont know about everyone else.
Well, shes very impulsive. We know that.
I have to go to bed.Tammy will be up in a hour.
Go ahead.
Attention, party guests.
Hello.
Were T-minus five minutes or so.
So, if we can bring things downto a sotto voce,
that would help.
Im gonna turn off the lights.
No!
Well, fine. Just keep it down.
My God, is he q*eer.
He reminds me of Lanes brother.
Finally.
Were gonna go inside in a second.
Youre the one that dragged meout of the restaurant.
Come on.
You have to knock.You have to knock to get in.
What if its started already?
It doesnt matter if its started,you still have to knock.
No.
We were just in the neighborhood.
And my mother always saidnever show up empty-handed.
Oh, damn it.
No.
Surprise!
Sorry, I blew it in the hall.
But I am very surprised.
Don.
I have to say that I am honored and touched
to be included in this group of intimates.
And I predicted this, did I not?
This.
Who is this?
Oh, thats my wife.
Hi.
- Nice to meet you.- Charmed.
The domino theory is not a joke.
The Vietnamese are fighting a civil w*r.
There is no monolithic communism.
- Its an excuse.- Really?
Come on, Bert. Its for profit.
b*mb are the perfect product.
They cost a fortuneand you only use them once.
So, I suppose this young man hereis coming home in a bag for nothing.
If hes lucky.You ever read Johnny Got His g*n?
No eyes, no ears, no nose,tapping out his last wishes in Morse Code
with his deformed head.
I thought there were going to be girls here.
For purely selfish reasons,I want to thank you for excluding Joan.
I would have had to buy earplugsfor the ride home.
It wasnt up to me. Cant you tell?
Hell of a party. Jennifer couldnt make it.
- Im sorry to hear that.- No, she couldnt get a date.
Anyway, I know she said no gifts,but I got you this.
Open it.
You dont have to if you dont want to.
Its a silver-handled walking stick.
Oh, look, he got you a cane.
Don Ameche has one.Its a Steinway walking stick.
You could stick it up your assand have a concert.
Thank you very much.
Oh, my God, really?
A n*gro homosexual, a Canadian sexpot,and unaccompanied redhead.
I think this may be my key demographic.
Dont. Just leave it alone.
I know.
Youre wonderingwhat theyre laughing about.
Its not you.
Well, I, for one, thinkyoure very brave, Megan.
My mother always said
a woman should surpriseher husband every day.
Thats why they had no lock on the WC.
Its true.
Look at you delivering drinks.We should get you a pair of roller skates.
Roger, I didnt know you were invited.
Or did you just hear I was comingand show up?
Is he going bald?
It just goes on and on.
Its beautiful, but its very loud.
Listen, you can hear the trafficeven over this party.
I know.
Who cares? I just want to take my pants offand slide my ass on the carpet.
Hows the summer treating you?
Well, its been good because its been bad.
What do you do exactly?
Hes a journalist.
Underground papers mostly.
You may not have seen it.
And what exactly has been bad?
Well, I dont know.Four riots in three cities in two months.
It is terrible. And Lord knowsthe police arent much help.
I was raised sex, politics,and religion arent party talk.
Well, what does that leave?
I dont know. Alcohol and work?
Hello again.
Trudes, which one is Jane Sterling again?
The glamour puss with the tan.
Marry early and often.
Were thinking about smoking some teawith Megans friends out there.
- Will you keep an eye out for Don?- As long as youre just thinking about it.
You should join us.Kenny gets brave and recites poems.
And she thinks theyre good.
Oh, absolutely.
Megan was the best waitress they ever had.
No, but I did get the best tips.
- How did you manage that?- She laid on that accent.
You know, shes a really good actress.
Not good enough, obviously.
- Julia, come here for a second.- Hello there.
Hello.
- Glad you could come.- Great party.
You got a great spread here.
I just wanted to make sure we said hi.
I cant stay that long.I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.
But I guess you know that.
Come on, Don.
What are you doing?
Was that bad?
Hell, look who youre talking to.How do I know?
Okay, everyone. My friends.
First of all, I wanted tothank you all for coming.
And second of all,
I think Ive had just enough to drink
that Im ready to give my own presentto the birthday boy.
Thank you. Thank you all for coming.
I think we should call it a night.
Absolutely not, Don.
You stay there.
Did you buy him a pony?
Happy birthday, baby.
Why dont you sing like that?
Why dont you look like him?
Je mappelle Roger.
If I may raise a glass.
Happy birthday, Don!
As I was saying.
To Megan,
for letting us see the Don Draper smileusually reserved for clients.
Hear, hear!
And to Don,
you lucky so and so.
As a wise man once said,
the only thing worsethan not getting what you want
is someone else getting it.
Okay, now, no one hascalled and complained,
so theres no reasoneveryone shouldnt dance.
I should probably clean up.
Leave it for the girl.
She doesnt come till Monday.
Call her and have her come tomorrow.
And Monday.
Problem solved.
Did you have fun?
Move over.
No, I just want to sleep.
Oh, come on.
I know you had a good time. I can see it.
I dont want to talk.I just want to go to sleep.
Hey.
Dont waste money on things like that.
It was my money,
and you dont get to decidewhat I do with it.
Well, could you please not use itto embarrass me again?
What?
I know why youre upset.
Youre 40.
Ive been 40 for half a year.
When is that gonna stop?Only you know that.
This is your birthday now.
Fine,
I dont like my birthday.
I told you, I never had itwhen I was growing up and
Ive never wanted it since.
You never had a birthday?
Didnt Betty ever throw you a party?
No, because I forbid it.
Why?
I dont need to be the center of attention.
You love attention.
You twitched every timeI talked to another person.
More people feel the way I dothan the way you do.
Wheres your research?
Fine, Im 40.
Its too late.
Nobody loves Dick Whitman.
I love you.
Thats why I threw you a party.
Im going to sleep.
You can do what you want.
Excuse me. Someones left...
Theres a wallet herefrom some previous passenger.
Ill turn it in to dispatch.They got a lost and found.
Theres close to $100.
Yeah, it happens all the time.
Id feel better if I saw to its return.
Youre putting me in a jam here.The guys gonna call looking for it.
Thats me.
You know what?You do what you got to do, mister.
Thats for you.
High tides and heavy surf
battered the coast of North Carolina today.
Force 20 winds andheavy rain forced evacuation
along the coast as farinland as three miles.
That was quite a soiree.
Did Masters and Johnson come in yet?
They havent passed by.
I should come and sit downso I can see them slink in, in shame.
You seem to be in fine spirits.
Well, I didnt get intotoo much trouble on Saturday.
Plus, Mohawk called meat home this morning.
I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,but I have your wife.
- Which line?- Three.
- Its blinking.- Theyre all blinking.
Three.
- If you dont mind.- Ive called a partners meeting.
Hello, dearest.
Look, I know you were upset when you left,
and perhaps Im overreacting.
Becca, dear,
this is why I dont like youopening the mail.
I only want to ensurethat Nigel is enrolled in the fall.
Nigels enrollment isnt an issuewhether we pay now or not.
Then why would they attachsuch a threatening letter to a bill?
Wouldnt you rather have your moneyin June than September if you were them?
Well, I worry about themsaving his spot for him,
especially with his marks.
I assure you that St. Pauls is awarethat we plan on having him return
and simply wishes to earnwhatever interest they can
on the full amountfor the next three months.
Couldnt you spare that interestin exchange for my peace of mind?
Lane, darling?
What? Im sorry. I didnt get that last bit.
Nothing.
Dont forget to get the nameof Megans real estate agent.
Yes, dear.
And her decorator.
Apolo, youre so good with him.
I wasnt expecting you back so soon.
First in line at the post office.It wasnt that bad.
Hello, Miss Joan.
Sink is draining.
Turns out it was a lemon peel.
Im sure you know were appreciative,but Mother and I have so much to do.
I am busy, busy, too.
You dont have to rush off.
He doesnt have to rush off, does he?
When you need Apolo, you call Apolo.
Miss Joan.
I want him to hear. That was just rude.
It is one thing to have him work here,
it is another thingto give him cake and my baby.
His fingers have been in every toiletfrom here to the Bowery.
He brought the cookies.
If you want to go on a date with him,just ask.
Hes married with four children.
Im just making surethis apartment gets his attention.
This apartment has never had any troublegetting his attention.
Yes, Joanie. Everyones staring at you.
You know youre not exactlyat your fighting weight.
Try me.
You asked me to come out here.
You can go home any time you want.
You should think before you say that.
I got my moneys worth.
Well, I wasnt going to show you this.
That doesnt make any sense.
Look, Im sure its not the wayanyone wants you to find out.
No, its not in the want ads.
And, honestly, they dont havethe money for more people.
Its not more people. Its you.
You love stirring the shit.
I am telling you somethingyou dont want to hear,
and you are making this very painful for me.
Megan Draperjust invited me to her party.
At the very last minute.Dont tell me that girls not conniving.
You think she wants youaround her husband?
Im going to lie down.
Sometimes life makes decisions for you.
- Have a good day.- Okay.
I know your birthday was last week,
and I was told you dont celebrate itand not to bring it up.
Now I feel like I got caughtwith my pants down,
so I got you a little something.
Its a plant.
I just wanted to say happy birthday.
Kiss-ass.
Thank you.
I can get you some coffee,but theres a partners meeting.
- Nobodys there.- Its in Mr. Campbells office.
- You want to smile?- Is it your obituary?
No, its the little saltwe rubbed in Y&Rs wound.
Its beautiful, no?
- Thats Mr. Campbell.- Shall we?
What?
We dont make fun ofeach others wives here. Understood?
Come on, I wasnt making fun of her.I was making fun of you.
- Youre happy.- I am.
Well, I want you to be happy.
Somebody should be.
You know, two weeks ago,
Jane asked me, "Which ones Mussolini?"
No, its good. Shes a great girl.
Theyre all great girls.At least until they want something.
Lets go.
Theyre just leaving now.
What, did they stop for a drink?
Well, why dont you get off your rear,find them, and tell them Im about...
Theyre here.
Gentlemen, if you could slide over a bit.
- A marvelous fete.- Oh, yes.
I have instructions from Trudyto thank both of you.
- Why are we meeting in here?- Why are we here?
Please, dont smoke in here.I spent the morning choking on the train.
So, Mohawk is coming in.Ive brought them in.
- What do you know about that?- Thats great news.
- When?- I dont know.
AII I was thinking is thatI bring Henry and Jack in here
to this very gathering of individuals,but I have one question.
Where are they going to sit?
I mean, what kind of impressiondoes this space give you?
Do you gaze uponthe cement column and think,
"Yes, I believe success for meand my company dwells here."
Why dont you take themto the conference room?
Because its not that meeting.
Fine, well have it in my office.
This does not involve you, Roger.
Nor does Vicks, Playtex,Life cereal, Samsonite,
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.
Need I go on?
What are you suggesting?
Hes suggestingthat you give him your office.
- No, hes not.- Yes, I am.
Well, forget it.
Where am I supposed to conduct business?
In the crapper, for all I care.
Im a full partner and youre a junior,so sorry, Charlie, but thems the breaks.
Gentlemen, Im sure we can findan equitable solution to this.
- Theres no need for a row.- Youre right.
I say we put it to a vote.
I say we step outside.
I didnt think so.
Good work on Mohawk.
Thank you, but Im dead serious about this.
I have too much responsibilityand too much business
to apply my k*ll in this environment.
You all know it.
Well buy more space.
- If were handing out offices...- Absolutely not.
I cant extend our credit line any further.
Itll work itself out.


Congratulations.
When are they coming in?
Im still not sure they should,considering the situation.
Great party, Don.
Absolutely.
I couldnt sleep.
Those tits and that mouth.
Shes such a sex kitten.
That whole dance. How did he just sit there?
You cant stand uponce you get in that condition.
I would have. I would have just stood upand grabbed her little French behind
and pushed herthrough those cheap post-war walls.
- Hi, Megan.- Very funny.
God, what I would do to her.
Like what, for example?
Ill tell you what.
I would love to see those heelson my shoulder.
"Je voudrais mas Harry."
Good morning.
Great party.
Thrilled to be included.Jennifer was very jealous.
I think Im gonna die.
You could have warned me.
I did.
I have the owner of the walletreturning your call.
Thank you.
- Hello.- Hello, Mr. Pryce.
Im calling for Alex Polito.
- And who is this?- This is his girl, Delores.
Well, when he comes into the office,
I think I should speak with him personally.
Im not his secretary. Im his girl.
Im like his wife,but I cant call myself that.
You dont sound happy about that.
- Excuse me?- Im married myself.
Good for you. Whats her name?
Rebecca. Rebecca Pryce. Well, obviously.
- Thats a pretty name.- I suppose so.
She enjoys it.
Do you think shes home right now,lying in bed, talking to a stranger?
I should hope not.
So, you have Alexs wallet?
Yes, I do.
- And where are you?- Im at my offices in Midtown.
Are you in big business?
Excuse me?
Are you in a big office building?
Yes.
Thats why I dont have the luxuryof lying around at 11:00 in my underthings.
I didnt tell you that part.
You didnt say I was incorrect, either.
Where the hell are you from?
You sound like Cary Grant.
I told you, Midtown.
Why dont I...
Listen, I really should return this,you know, the wallet.
I could slip it in the post or...
Of course, you know,that has its disadvantages.
Theres a bit of cash here.
Or I could hand-deliver it.
Is this a current address?
I dont know.
I dont know if that would be proper.
No, of course.
Why dont you meet meat my place of business?
Ill give you the addressor have my secretary help you.
Yeah. Why dont we do that?
And Ill come by when I can.
Well, Ill be here the rest of my life.
Just a minute.
I look forward to it.
Why not?
Toodle-oo.
Thats cute.
Scarlett, would you give this womandirections to our office?
Shes on line three.
Mr. Crane, Mr. Sterlinghas requested you in his office.
Is there a meeting?
He just came over here, saidhe needed to see you, and walked away.
- Why didnt he come in?- I dont know.
He knows youre in there.
Okay. Okay.Did you see him talking to Megan or Don?
Ive been working.
- What did you do?- Nothing!
You wanted to see me?
I did. Come in, have a seat.
No, thats okay.
I think you should have a seat.
Okay.
Now,
I think you know that we like tothink of this place as a family.
And there are certain ways a family behaves.
What did she say?You have to hear my side of it.
Your side of what?
What... Nothing.
Youre always up to something,arent you, Crane?
It was an honest mistakeand I consider myself reprimanded.
Great.
I was thinking Pete could take your office.
Really?
Look, I will apologize face to face,
as horrible as that will be,but I think youre...
Theres no reason to let me go.
Youre not getting fired.
And what the hell did you do?
I made fun of Zou Bisou.
So did I.
Is that a crime? No.
I tried to get Jane to talk to mein that accent. Nothing doing.
She doesnt speak French.She doesnt like me.
I went home after andJennifer didnt know what was coming.
- I was like...- I dont want to hear that.
No, of course you dont. Why would you?
Look, I think you can understandthat Pete needs a bigger office.
And just between you, me,and the window washer,
its been decided that you should trade.
- Who decided that?- I did.
I cant do that.And I dont know that I have to do it.
Do I?
Harry.
Im asking you as a friend.
And I appreciate that, Roger, I really do,but I need my office.
Look, first of all,Petes office isnt that different.
- I disagree.- Fine.
Name the most important personyou could bring into this office.
William Paley.
Okay, so you shouldnt do that.
Trust me, network and studio executiveswant to think youre out there jet-setting,
rubbing shoulders with television starsand chorus girls.
You should be talking to clients ringside
or at a three-star restaurant,not coming into your miserable little office.
But I do. I come in here almost every day.
And Petes office is a sh*tholewith a support beam.
What if I were to make it worth your while?
Im already head of my department.
What would be an appropriate bonus?
Theres no bonuses. We have no money.
How much would it take?
Well, first of all,its more than you could have on you.
Really?
Thats $1,100.
Why do you carry so much cash?
Its more than 1,000, Harry.
That is a months salary after taxes.
Theres no window in there.
You could buy yourself a very beautifulpicture of something to look at.
Well, okay. But youre gonna owe me.
No, Im not. I just gave you a lot of money.
This is a transaction.And if you dont like it,
we can have the conversationyou thought we were having.
- So this is every month?- Get the hell out of my office.
Excuse me. Im sorry.
Im Joan.
Im Meredith. Can I help you?
Joan Harris.
I work here.
Worked here. Ive been on leave.
Joan. My goodness.
Its hard to believe you just had a baby.
You dont know where I started.
Do you want me to announce you?
No, Ill let myself in.
Are you sure?
No one mentioned a new girl.
I guess they needed someone up herebecause Scarlett is now covering Mr. Pryce
so that she can do the books with Clara.
Well, now I can understandwhy I wasnt told.
Oh, my God. My mouth.
Could you just help me with the door?
Hes adorable.
Please dont be mad at mefor telling you that.
Im very happy being nobody here.
I know a girl who had yourjobwho ended up with everything.
Where would you like to visit first?
I suppose my office.
Yes, yes, absolutely. Joan.
My goodness, you look radiant.
- Can I see him?- I dont see why not.
- Wheres Scarlett?- Go fetch Caroline.
Joanie.
Look at you out and about.
Yes, were gonna stop by The Copa later.
One of us badly needs a drink.
Lane made it very clearwere not hiring anybody.
I dont care how buxom his mother is.
Don.
- Look at that.- Hes okay.
Hello, Megan.
Hello, Joan.
Im sure Im not ruiningany surprises at this point,
but how was your party?Im sorry I missed it.
Hes adorable.
Are we welcoming you back?
- That was my impression.- Today?
- Do you want to hold him?- What?
Hes a little cabbage.
Its just a matter of time, Don.
I should be getting back to work.
Im gonna quit while Im ahead.
Joanie, Ill say what I saidwhen you left here,
this is not a good excuse.
Nice to see you.
- When are you coming back?- I was planning on three weeks.
My mothers leaving any day,so I was gonna hire a girl.
Its gonna be terrible to leave him.
Joan.
I was wondering if you were going to visit.
My hands are dirty.
Oh, my God. He looks just like you.
I should get back to work.I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.
Good.
So, how are you?
Well, well, well.
Theres my baby.
Now move that brat out of the wayso I can see her.
Hello, Roger.
Little dud like my present?
Im sure youre aware that a bicyclesnot useful yet, Uncle Roger.
Oh, no? Hes a loafer?
Hes been keeping me awake.He needs constant attention.
Is that right? Let me see that.
Has anyone even seen this babywith you walking next to him?
Scarlett. Scarlett, may I see you?
I got it.
Mr. Pryce, Mrs. Harris is here to see you.
- Send her in.- Ive got him.
Caroline, I need you tomake dinner reservations right away.
Ill be right back.
This really is an unexpected pleasure.
Just stopping by.
Anything I should know about?
Yes, actually. Pressing business.
Would you mind?
No, not at all.
What are we supposed to do with him?
Better than the steps of a church, I guess.
Have either of you seen Clara?
No.
Whats that?
Its Joans little boy.
Thats darling.
Would you please take himand give him back to Joan?
Do I suddenly appear to be wearing a skirt?
Spectacular party.
Just take him.You should say hello to Joan anyways.
Clara?
She looks very good.
She does. She looked good at nine months.
I dont know about that.
Im surprised you didnt tell her.
- Tell her what?- That she looked terrible.
You seem to say whatevers on your mind.
Is something wrong?
No.
I got the Vicks coupons done.
I know you thought you werethe only one working this weekend.
No, I didnt.
Really? Thats what you said to Don.
I know. I had too much to drink and...
And you couldnt resistsaying something obnoxious?
Well, just so were clear,I put in a lot of work on Heinz. So did you.
You cant even apologize. None of you can.
- Im sorry.- Youre sorry?
What is wrong with you people?
Youre all so cynical. You dont smile.You smirk.
Is he mad at me?
I dont care.
Who wouldnt want a surprise party?
I dont feel well.
Megan...
No, really, I dont feel well.
Am I allowed to go home?
Of course.
Im so sorry. You were right.
I apologize.
Its fine.
Heinz wont sign off on the work.
So they wont be back in for 30 days,
which means we wont get paidfor another 90.
And were about to sh**t Christmas adsfor Sugarberry and Vicks.
But they wont run until Christmas,
so we wont get paid until Easter.
Well, that explains whyyoure asking me for all this free advice.
Im just trying to get things in order.
So that you can eliminate my job?
What? Absolutely not.
- Then why did you run an ad?- What ad?
- In this mornings Times.- Oh, that.
That wasnt an ad.
Well, what the hell was it, then?
It was some private barb directed at Y&R.
Mrs. Harris, the books havepractically been held together
with spit in your absence.
What about Scarlett and Clarasplitting my work?
Splitting?
The two of them together couldnt operatea parking meter. Theyre imbeciles.
Well, that was a dumb thing to do.
Oh, there, there.
Im sorry.
Ive been like this since the baby.
And its not him.
I just
keep thinking about whats going on here,and I missed it too much.
Its too embarrassing.
Nothings happened.
Something always happens.Things are different.
Somebody tells a joke andyou dont know what theyre talking about.
There have been no jokes, not without you.
Not even at my expense?
Im terribly adrift without you.
Its just a matter of timebefore they find out Im a sham.
Nobody came to visit me.
They sent flowers with some stupid cardwritten by the florist.
There would have been a cake,but you werent here to arrange it.
Its just...
And I dont expect you to understand this,
but my husbands been gone so long.
And I know hes coming home soon.
And even with my baby thereand my mother,
I feel alone.
Its home, but its not everything.
I do understand.
Now, I wont have everyone thinkingIve made you cry.
Well, at least tell me about the party.
Mrs. Draper put on a bit of a burlesque.
- No.- Oh, yes.
She danced and sang in front of all of us.
She was quite the coquette.
I cant do it justice.
And Don?
I saw his soul leave his body.
I cant even imagine how handsomethat man must be blushing.
Yes.
I dont know how I ended up with him, but...
Thank you so much.
Mr. Pryce, I will be speaking with you.
Let me take a look at him at least.
Handsome little blagger.
Have you seen Clara?
Congratulations. Were gonna beright next to each other finally.
Whats going on?
Clara, could you excuse us?
Well, she obviously already knows.
Please.
Roger, you know, convinced me.
We all thought it was best for the firmthat you have a bigger office,
so I was asked to switch.
Ill be right back.
I appreciate your sacrifice,but a bigger office was not the point.
Well, fine, then. Ill switch back.
Roger didnt say I couldnt switch back.
I dont care what Roger says.I am the head of accounts.
I am bringing in all the business.I deserve the bigger office.
Its a great office, Pete.
Its very important.
Its got the windows.God, Im gonna miss them.
And you did thisbecause Roger told you to?
And also because I respect you so much.
What do you want me to say?
Look, I just need a place to hideuntil Megan leaves.
Oh, God, unless she told Don.
Shes not gonna tell Don, is she?
I dont know what youre talking about.
Come in.
Whats up?
At your party, which was lovely,
I said somethingwhich I shouldnt have said,
and I want to apologizeif you had a bad time because of it.
I had a wonderful time.
Well, good.
The only reason Im bringing it upis Megan seemed kind of upset.
Im very sorry.
I should not be allowed to drinkat work functions.
Or at all, honestly.
- What did she say?- Nothing.
But she went home. She wasnt feeling well.
Im mortified if I had somethingto do with it.
When did she leave?
I think she wants to be alone.
You dont know her at all.
Caroline.
Im done for the day.
Mr. Pryce.
Yes, Scarlett?
Theres a gentleman here,the owner of the wallet, Mr. Polito.
Hes in reception. Shall I bring him back?
No, absolutely not.
Well, do you want to see him?
Yes, Ill be out in a moment.
Of course, Mr. Pryce.
Thank you, Delores.
- Excuse me?- I said... Just a minute.
Hello.
Are you Mr. Polito?
I am. Although theres no wayfor you to know that.
You got my wallet.
I contacted you.
Thank you.
Well, Im glad this worked out.
Hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Everythings there.
So it is.
Well, you cant blame me.
My horse came in and then I lost my wallet.
Then it came in again.
No, thats not necessary.
- Youve got to take a reward.- I couldnt possibly.
My girl said you were real polite.
Obviously from the accent,youre not from around here.
No, Im not.
This is the way we do things.
Thanks again. I mean it.
Youre a real gentleman.
Megan? Where are you?
Youre home.
So are you. What happened?
Nothing.
You just left without me?
- I was upset.- Thats clear.
About what?
Because my apartment is filthy.
Wheres the girl?
I sent her home.
What are you doing?
Im cleaning up. I dont want to get sweaty.
- Like that?- Dont you look at me.
Im talking to you.
Im cleaning up.
Really?
Stop looking at me.You arent allowed to look at me.
Then put some clothes on.
I said stop it. You dont deserve it.
Come on.
You dont like presents.You dont like nice things.
Besides, youre too old.
I dont need an old person.
You probably couldnt do it anyway.
Dont!
- Get up.- No.
I dont want people to thinkyoure getting this.
You want it so badly.
I dont want it. I dont want you.
You dont get to have this.Go sit over there.
AII you get to do is watch.
Wheres Harry?
Who cares?
Im sorry. Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?
No.
Is Roger Sterling still here?
Yes.
I want you to let him do whatever he wants.
And I want you to pencil inan appointment tomorrow
at the coffee shop in the ferry buildingin Staten Island.
6:00 a.m.
With Coca-Cola.
Okay.
Thatll be all.
I dont think those people like me.
Thats not true.
Well, Im not sure I like them.
The reason I didnt wantyou to have that party is
I didnt want them in our home.
Youve only been in the creative endof this business for three months.
And being a secretary,you dont know what goes on.
There isnt one problem that Peggyor anybody in that office has
that wasnt there before you.
You think youre a splinter?
Youre not.
The whole foots been infected for years.
I love going to work with you because
you love work and you love me.
But I wonder if maybe its not a good idea.
I dont really care about work.
I want you at work
because I want you.
I think we have to replace the rug.
Just because you see white carpetin a magazine doesnt mean its practical.
Its beautiful.
Well, Ive taken a lot of picturesof white carpets.
You have to have four or five on hand.
I thought you wanted it.
I just wanted you to have what you want.
What are you doing?
Ive got to go to Staten Island.
- What time is it?- Shut up.
An aboveground pool?
No, no, in the ground. With deck chairs.
That costs a fortune.You gonna dig it yourself?
Well see what happens at Christmas.
I never count on a bonus.
Im not talking to you.
I hope to be dead by Christmas.
Do you have any money for the grocer?
You told me not to write any checks.
No, of course.
Hes finally gone to sleep.
We cannot call security.They are applicants.
Whats going on out there?
Theyre all here respondingto your hilarious advertisement.
Is it just me,or is the lobby full of negroes?
They saw the Y&R ad.
The humor was lost on them.
- Not on me.- It was a childish prank.
Because youre above that, right?
What are we gonna do?
Would you leave us be, dear?
Tell them the positions been filled.
Theres the possibilitythat we could be the subject of a protest.
Then we interview them. Forever.Theyll go away.
That is not a solution.
And whos to saytheres not a reporter out there?
I dont know why we cant just hire one.
Because were not hiring anyone.
Just fire that receptionist.
We cant have one out there.
- What is that?- Its from Young & Rubicam.
Its a resume.
"1960 to 65,
"toted dat barge, lifted dat bale."
Did those people out there
see that artifact come in here?
Yes. Im positive.
Good morning.
Id like to thank you all for coming.
First of all,were only looking for secretaries.
So, gentlemen, you are free to leave.
I mean, you are welcome to leave.
I mean, you may go.
I will be collecting resumes,
and then those of youwho meet the qualifications
will receive a callto schedule an interview.
