Man:Who is don draper?
Excuse me?
Who is don draper?
What do men saywhen you ask that?
Well, they usually takea minute to think about it
Then they do something cute.
One creative directorsaid he was a lion tamer.
I dont want to do that.
- In the third person?- I dont know.
Knockout wife, two kids,house in Westchester.
Take the train...maybe you take your car
Now that you can afford it.
And who told you that?
Anything?
I mean, nows your chance.
Well, as I said before,Im from the Midwest.
We were taught that its notpolite to talk about yourself.
Obviously your glo-coatfloor wax commercialscaused a bit of a squeal,
On the creative side anyway.
What made you thinkof this idea?
I wanted it to beindistinguishablefrom the movies.
I wanted people to bewatching it and say,
"whats happeningin the story right now?"
Oh, its something else.
"Its not an ad."
At least not forthe first    seconds of it.
Very good then.
I think I have all I need.
Its onlya few hundred words,but on the bright side,
The picture may bebigger than the article.
Oh, uh, you all should meet.
This is Jack Hammondfrom "advertising age."
Roger sterlingand Pete Campbell.
I hope were notinterrupting this crisp
And engaging portraityoure painting.
- Ahh...- ( clatters )
Steady there.
- What happened there?- Korea.
Were gratefulfor your sacrifice.
- Peter.- Jack.
Well, its niceto meet you all.
Id love to bend your earwhen I finish my book.
Certainly.
Don, it was a pleasure.
- I look forward to the article.- We all do.
My Uncle lost his leghitching a trailer.
Used to ask meto scratch his toes.
- He didnt have any.- We dont have time, Roger.
One quick pop, Louise.
All right, where is this party?
- The Sheraton?- A wooden leg...
Theyre so cheap they canteven afford a whole reporter.
Im Peter Campbelland Im assuming youre Jim.
- And this must be Murray.- Bob... Murray stayedin Portland.
Too bad.Missing jackhammer season.
Roger sterling.
- And you must beDonald draper.- Don.
Bob.
Were very very excited youhad time to meet with us, don.
Murray told us y&rhad done glo-coat.
Turns outeverybody in New Yorkexcept him knows its you.
And I think theyrea little jealous.
Cant tell whothe client is here.
I know a little,but what we need to know...
What don needs to know is
What exactly is your concern?
I must say Im gettingtired of saying this today.
Next time just haveone meeting.
We at Jantzen have hada steady   % biteof the apple.
But the two-pieceis most of our concern.
You have a great bikini.Ive spent some timewith the catalogue
And I would sayno concerns at all.
Its not a bikini.
A bikini is underwearyou wear to the beach.
We make a two-piecebathing suit.
Were a family company.
And nowadays its toughto make a dent
If your ads dont looklike a girlie magazine.
Do you want women who wantbikinis to buy your two-piece
Or do you just want to make surewomen who want a two-piece
Dont suddenly buy a bikini?
My lord.That question just tieda knot in my brain.
( chuckles )
Our competitors get bigger
The smaller they makethat swimsuit.
We dont do that.
We would like to find a waywithout playing in the gutter.
And thats just whoour customers are.
Right now.
I love how they sit therelike a couple of choirboys.
You know one of themsleaving New York with v.D.
Where the hell have you been?
- Roger: Whats the problem?- Don!
- Can you give me a minute?- I dont mind waiting.
( phones ringing )
- Howd it go?- Get back to work.
How was your interview?
Count to     and buzz me.
You missed Jeff Atherton.
He came here expresslyto see you.
Im sorry, I didnt knowhe was coming and I dontknow who that is.
You have no idea how tinythis place looks to a stranger.
Did you tell him aboutthe second floor?
I refuse to be any partof that charade.
I wanted an office downtown.
We overspent.We could have gota lot more for our money.
And we could have hada conference table.
Atherton thought the lackof a conference table
Was deliberate.He felt that a...
Circle of chairsdemands a conversation.
About why there is no table.
- ( sighs )- they loved you.
What exactly is the problem?
Well, first of alltheyre prudes.
Second of ally&r were standing inthe hallway when we left.
Youve been ona cattle call before.
When the competition was fair.
Every hour of my timehas to be accounted for
In the growth of this company.
Get me in a roomwhere I have a chance.
In the end its going to comedown to big versus small.
Theres two firmsin the middle:Kenyon & Eckhardt,
And DArcy.Theyll canceleach other out.
Y&r has six floorsof creative.
They can throw bodiesat this account for weeks.
- We dont havethat kind of firepower.- We dont have to.
Were the scrappy upstart.
You dont say thatto the clients, do you?
Secretary:Your accountant is waiting.
Send him in.
Creatively, y&r is not capableof living in this neighborhood.
You know why?
Because you dont work there.
- John.- Marsha.
- John.- Marsha.
John!
Happy Thanksgiving.
Oooh, my mothers goingto be over the moon.
Enjoy it.Its the last thingwere going to get from them.
- What?- Did you k*ll sugarberry?
- Thats a third of my work.- Stop jumping to conclusions.
I guess when Kreutzersaid they were goingto send us all hams
He really meant onein a cardboard boxwith no note.
Its about as subtleas an atomic b*mb.
Maybe theyre cheap.
Do you honestly thinkthis is a good sign?
The work wasold-fashioned.
And whose fault is that?
Well, testing at foursupermarkets in queens,
How much were theyspending? Nothing.
If the test was a success,they would have gone national
And they could bea big account.
Damn it!
I thought we weregetting on a streak.
Does this mean Im downto two days a week?
- Don hated the work.- Put the ham on his desk.
Hes probably havingThanksgiving dinneralone in there.
Thats not nice.
Marsha!
Im serious.
Okay, life insurance policy,its a company policy.
It pays the company,not the family.
What do you think?
It wouldnt be bad to havea little security for the kids.
According to this,Im already a wealthy man.
Uncle Sam will takea healthy bite.
He already has.
And...
The only other issueis the house.
What about it?
Well, October  stshe was supposed to be out.
It seemed so far awaywhen we agreed to that.
Get her and him out of thereand sell it.
I can call Ben Michaelsonand have him draft a doozy.
Start world w*r III?
Youre carrying a mortgage,
Plus insurance and taxes
For a house you dont live in.
Leave it alone.
So how are your balls?Are you enjoying yourself?
Come on.
I dont want it like this.I want it like that.
Not too much of that,just a little like this.
And then they look at itand they dont like it.
Two of their test marketsare in Jewish neighborhoods.Theyre idiots.
How much does it cost for usto buy all the product?
Too much and wed haveto do it every day.
So how much does it costfor us to get
    women to line upat one store, one afternoon,
Clean them out once?
    people?Do you know how biga line that is?
People would talk about it.
- Its a p.R. Stunt.- We dont do that.
- Why not?- Because you cantcharge for it.
So what?
Two womenfighting over one ham,
But they have to really fight.
They have to get arrestedor something.
Because its the last ham.
We dont have to write a play.
Its Thanksgiving.Theyre shopping.The stakes are very high.
Old Chuck Dewey couldprobably get a story
In the "daily news"for a case of something.
$   per actress.We could get Gladyswhats-her-name.
Whos the old lady who nevertakes off her mittens?
- I dont have any money.- John!
Marsha!
I can use my expense accountif I say theyre whores.
Top-shelf liquor,whats that gonna run?
Harry gets a case a month
For sticking his noseup some guys ass at n.B.C.
Should I run it by don?
Really?
Well see.Ill call casting.
( door opens )
Oh, good, I got youwhen youre vulnerable.
- What do you need?- Someone white to carveour Turkey.
( sighs )I cant, Roger.I have plans.
You told me that.Then you told me you hadthe kids the day after.
But you never said noto Janes friend Bethany.
- No.- I was thinkingthe other day
About what happenswhen you leave hereand it made me very upset.
I could say the same thing.
Ill paint you the picturethats in my mind.
But if its true,I might k*ll myself.
Ive hardly been a monk.
Forget that she knows Jane.
This girls terrific.She looks like Virginia Mayo.
Shes   , mount Holyokegymnastics team.
See her this weekend.
You hit it off,come Turkey day maybeyou can stuff her.
( chuckles )
Sweetheart, :   Saturday night,
Jimmys la grangefor beauty and the beast.
- Roger.- They have chicken Kiev.
The butter squirts everywhere.
- Hello, Mr. Draper.- Hello, Celia.
I made you some pork chops.Theyre good cold too.
I look forward to it.
But you dont eat nothing.
- Have you seen my shine Kit?- I put it on the topof the closet.
- ( TV playing )- the children comingthis weekend?
No.
You need to put thingsback where you found them.
I didnt want to leave itin the middle of the floor.
Okay, good night.You have a good weekend.
And eat something.
( g*n on TV )
( old West musicplaying )
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Footprints on a wet floor...
Thats no longera hanging offense.
Glo-coatspatented formula
Goes on easyand dries in seconds.
( door opens )
( TV playing )
So how do you know Jane?
Before you ask me allthe questions, you haveto let me finish one glass.
I dont have to ask youany questions.
I think Im actually nervous.
I havent done thissince college.
Not that it was so long ago,although it seems like it.
I borrowed a dress.
You sat down so fastI didnt get a good look.
Do you want to see it?
( giggles )
I cant believe I did that.
Its hard to believethere are two girlswho can wear that.
Don, I want to lifta shadow off this evening.
I know this is your first date.
First that Rogerwas involved in.
Oh, of course.Im sure. Its just...
Im breakinga lot of my rulesseeing a divorced man.
But Jane has made youher personal cause.
And there are so manyreal problems in the world.
I know.
The world is so dark right now.
The country?
My goodness,youve made me feel veryserious all of a sudden.
I dont know if I can make youfeel better about the world.
One of the boys k*llin Mississippi...
Andrew Goodman,he was from here.
A girlfriend of mineknew him from summer camp.
Is that what it takesto change things?
What do you do?
Im an actress.
But right now Im a superin the opera.
- And what is that?- A supernumerary.
Were the actorsthat fill the stage.
Like the chorus?
Mmm, no singing.
I do a lot of mock drinking.
Im a wench.Im a...
Courtesan.
Part of a harem.It depends on the opera.
That is truly fascinating.
I love the music.
And I love backstage.
Our costumes are as goodas the singers.
And I love the stories.
Theyre very romantic.
Have you been?
I have.
But only for businessso Ive never enjoyed it.
Well, then you mustcome as my guest.
They give the supers ticketsinstead of payinga decent wage.
- Madam?- Oh, I dont evenneed to look.
Chicken Kiev.
They make you wear a bib.
Come on, lets have some fun.
Two chicken Kievs.
The barbizon.
I bet that wouldmake a great opera.
It would.
Well, I guessthis is good night.
Okay.
Good night.
So am I going to see youat Roger and Janesfor Thanksgiving?
Its tempting, but...
I have plans.
Oh, Im sure the holidaysmust be very complex.
It may have been awhilesince youve had to pick upon messages,
But I want to see you again.
How about right now?
I stopped the meter.We can start it again.
Itll be likeI just picked you up.
Will you please take a weak no?
Lets see wherewe are new years eve.
- If its meantto be, itll keep.- Let me walk you in.
No.
I know that trick.
Waverly and  th Avenue.
I think you both reallyacquitted yourselves well.
She doesnt know when to stop.You dont know when to stop.
My objectivewas to get the ham.
No one told you to hit me.
That wasnt part of it.
The important thing is that...oh, heres Mr. Campbell.
Ive been assured you ladiescan look for your names
And perhaps your picturein Mondays "daily news."
- What section?- Its the "daily news."its one big section.
All in all,not a bad wayto spend a Sunday.
Can you go back to the marketand get me some aspirin?
We probably shouldnt have anymore contact for the time being.
- ( pills rattle )- shall we?
We really appreciateyour talent
And of course, your discretion.
- You hurt me.- Ow ow ow!
Ladies, ladies, ladies!
- Daisy!- Walk her to the train.
- Are you okay, dear?- Yeah.
Lets get you in a cab.
- Good morning.- Welcome back.How was Los Angeles?
Very hard to leave.
I would love a vacation.
It wasnt a vacation.
I had a lot of tsuriswith Lucy and Desi.
Has someone beenusing my office?
Mr. Sterling doesnthave a television.
Im callinga meeting for   :  .
No, make it  :  .Do we have a table yet?
 :   and no.
- Hi.- Yes?
- Do you know wherethe seacore rough cut is?- Peggy: I got it!
Dont you want to know why?
I sold the jai alai TV special.
Really?
A.B.C.Theyre moving towards
All these eccentricsporting events... go-karts.
Well, thats very exciting.
Can you get someone to trackdown a cup of coffee for me?
And Id lovea grapefruit juice.And, Joan?
- That is my news.- I wont even tell peopleafter its aired.
Good morning,Mr. Draper.
Don, can I speakwith you for a minute?
Morning.
- Lane, would youexcuse us for a minute?- Of course.
Good morning, don.
You know,
No one whos ever beenassociated with an actual event
Has thought its been portrayedhonestly in the newspaper.
"Donald draper,or don as he is known"
Perhaps in an attemptto appear humble,is a handsome cipher.
One imagines somewherein an attic
"Theres a painting of himthats rapidly aging."
For a guy from "ad age"he can really write.
- He also says youre married.- Jesus.
He never asked me that.Did he check any facts?
You didnt give him any facts.
- He had to makesome assumptions.- My job is to write ads,
Not go aroundtalking about who I am.
Who knows who you are?
This was supposed to bean advertisement for the firm.
Why do you have so many copies?
I bought one to read.
I was going to buy oneto frame in reception,and then I read it.
I just wantedto get them allbefore anyone else did.
Itll be lining bird cagesby Friday.
This is a missed opportunity.
You turned all the sizzlefrom glo-coat into a wet fart.
Plus you sound like a prick.
Well, its done.
I learned a valuable lesson:
Stay away fromone-legged reporters.
Yeah, I was thinkingabout that...
Who is he to criticize anybody?
Just so youdont k*ll yourself,there was some good news.
Janes friend foundyou to be charming.
Although a littlegrabby in the car.
That is good news.Thank you.
She liked you.Maybe you should havefondled peg-leg Pete.
They raise you upand they knock you down.
I dont know whatI could have done differently.
I believe that you werebeing modest, but he didnt.
Im sorry, but afterthe year youve had,
Its just notappropriate anymore.
Hes expecting us!
- Is Joey coming?- Im here.
- Oh.- Why cant you cometo our office?
- Do you want to hear whatsugarberry said or not?- sh**t.
It was uproarious.First its Darryl,and he tells me about
How they stared atthe article all day yesterdayworrying about a lawsuit.
So I hang up and debatewhether or not to tell don...
Throw myself on my sword.And then Kreutzer calls
To tell me other paperspicked up the story.
And I think,"he knows its us,"but how could he?
And he said everyone,especially Darryl,was very excited.
And then he gets Christian:
Hes sorry someone got hurt,
But more people willtaste their ham now
And theyll love it.( chuckles )
Its beautiful.How do you put somethinglike this in your book?
You cant.We cant evencharge them.
It wouldnt be a bad idea
For them to increasetheir media budget.
- Seize the moment.- With more crappy ads?
- Hopefully not.- You use it.
The winner ofthe ham battle is you.
Can you imagine?Lanes dentures woulddrop out of his head
If we came inwith an additional buy.
"our hams are worthfighting for."
A cartoon pilgrim and an Indianin a tug of w*r with the ham.
Old ladies will smile.
Why didnt you pitchthat two months ago?Its good on its own.
A slogans nothingwhen you have a good idea.
Black crayon.I need it in an hour.
Chop chop, Joey.
Clara, could you get Darrylfor me at sugarberry?
Tell him its urgent.I may need you.
( buzzes )
Horace cook, Jr.Its urgent.
Ho-ho!How was Tijuana?
I have to say,its a very flatteringpicture.
And I dont thinkId mind beingdescribed that way.
Mr. Crane,youre a salesman.
You do not want to beknown as mysterious.
Therell beno further discussion.
I just got offthe phone with ho-ho.
- Jai alai is leaving.- What?
- Its over.- Bullshit. I just solda TV special to a.B.C.
Well, apparently don didntmention them in the article.
I didnt mention anyone.Thats the reporters job.
- Spectacular.- What the hells ho-hodoing reading "ad age"?
- Fix it.- Todd got all the partners
From c.G.C. To call and theyworked him up and down.
They told himwe laugh about him.
I dont!Get him him on the phone,
Get him in hereor camp out in his driveway.
He hung up on me.
I think he was crying.
How much was left inho-ho anyway?
Well survive with jai alaioff our list.
We will survive,but for how long?
The loss of jai alai
Makes lucky strike  % of our billings.


Its an untenablyinsecure position.
Harry, why dont you calland pretend like you dontknow any of this.
Give it an hourso hell take the call.
I wish we really hada second floor so I couldjump off it.
Im going to have to getyou another interview.
"the wall street journal."
And what do I do differently?
I told him the truth.
Who gives a crapwhat I say anyway?My work speaks for me.
Turning creative successinto business is your work.
And youve failed.
Itll pass.
- Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.- Happy Thanksgiving.
We started without you.
Oh, grandma Pauline,I told you motherswas at noon.
- We already ate.- Youre supposed to overeaton Thanksgiving.
Ooh, thank you.
Jamie, youll have something?
We missed dessert.
Youre next to your father.
- Put up some coffee, dear.- Hi, daddy.
Isnt that sweet?
We didnt forget you.
- What do you say?- Thank you.
- Thanks.- After you eat.
The traffic was simply m*rder.
Thats because thatswhats become of this country.
Everyone has twothanksgivings to go to.
Maybe we have twice as muchto be thankful for.
Dont you like the food, dear?
- No.- Sally draper, thats rude.
- You love cranberry sauce.- It has seeds in it.
- How about the sweet potato?- Im not hungry.
Look, theres marshmallow.
- ( coughing )- oh lord.
( gagging )
She might have a fever.
- Im sorry.- Its all right, dear.
- Isabel, can you bring a rag?- Sally: Ow, stop pinching me!
( door closes )
I love sweet potatoes.
( chuckles )
- Isabel!- ( knocks )
Happy Thanksgiving.
- Do you want a drink?- I dont have much time.
- I have supperwith my family.- Oh.
- Of course you do.- Should I not havementioned my family?
I never know howyoure going to react.
No, thats fine.
- Let me take off my brassiere.- No. In a minute.
Stop telling me what to do.I know what you want.
So do it.
Harder.
Again.
( phone ringing )
( ringing stops )
Hold on.
Surprise, its for you.
Why did you answer it?
It was the third try.I couldnt take it.
- Hello?- Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Im sorry to bother you.I didnt know youd have guests.
Whats wrong?
I need $    for bail.
- ( clears throat )- ( softly ) bye.
- Where are you?- It... its not for me.
Spit it out, honey.
Youre going to laugh.
( clears throat )
Pete and I hired some actresses
To get in a fightover a sugarberry ham.
You know, as a stunt.
We got them to increasetheir media budget.
Hello?
Im here.
Well, one of them pressedcharges against the other
For as*ault.Its $   bail
And $    apiece to keeptheir mouths shut.
And it has to happen today.
Call Pete!
Do you thinkyoure my first call?
Hello.Im so sorry to bother you.
- I oughta let youTwist in the wind.- It still worked out.
- Youll be very happy.- Im not happy.
And I dont thinkits funny or cute.
You run somethinglike that by me first.
I would have kept youfrom looking like an idiot,
Or worse yet,making me look like one.Is that what you want?
You want people to thinkwere idiots, Peggy?
Hey, theres no reasonfor name-calling.
- Shes been agonizing.- Who are you?
Im her fiance.
Mark, dont.
Whyd you bring himup here if you didntwant him involved?
I know.Im sorry, don.
- Fiance?- It just came out.
- Did you put the dog out?- Its cold outside.
But I locked herin the laundry room.
Its not cold in here.
( rattling )
( phone dialing )
Sally.
I was calling daddy.
Hello?
I wanted to wish hima happy Thanksgiving.
Youll see him tomorrow.
You want to call himto complain abouthow awful I am?
Dont expect any sympathy whenhe hears my side of the story.
- Dont!- Go to bed.
( sighs )Im going to have them takethat phone out of the hallway.
Mmm.
Tomorrow when the kids go,
Why dont we have Carlatake the baby and welldrive to a nice dinner?
Maybe Essex.
The Griswold inn.
Okay.

( doorbell rings )
Daddy!
- Oooh!- Dad.

So there wont beany more problems, okay?
- Okay.- Good night, daddy.
Good night,

( TV playing )

( TV playing )
( barking )
( laughing )
Let go!
Henry:What the hell is the dogdoing in the house?
You run up to bed.Ill wait.
For what?
Oh.
Its almost   :  .
- I thought you said   :  .- She didnt.
Ive waited for youplenty of times.
Henry, do you mind?
- Betty?- Its okay.
Does that mean I should stayor not stay?
Stay.
When are you moving out?
I dont know.
You were supposedto be out a month ago.
We havent found the rightplace for the kids.
Well, either do as we agreedor Im going to needto collect rent.
- What?- Or you could just buy itfrom me if you want to.
I cant believe you.
Don, its temporary.
Believe me, Henry,everybody thinks thisis temporary.
Good night.
( groans )
( door closes )
He has some nerve.
I know you dont wantto hear this,
But hes right.
Havent the kids beenthrough enough changealready?
I cant just uproot themwith no place to go.
Youre not even looking.
Theres nothing out there,and he doesnt decide.
( sighs )
- ( intercom buzzes )- miss Olson is hereto see you.
Send her in.
They sent one for each of us.
Could have just as easilyfired us.
But they didntbecause they soldmore hams.
And now you getto tell them why,if you want.
I think theyll be impressed.
Well, Im not.
I try and stay away fromthese kinds of shenanigans.
But I guess you knew thator you would have told me.
It was going greatuntil it wasnt.
Thanks for the ham.
I should have told you.
Since when do youhave a fiance?
I dont.
But you didnt haveto do that that way.
You brought him with youbecause you thought Iwouldnt embarrass you.
At least Im thinking ahead.
Doesnt always work, does it?
You need to thinka little bit more aboutthe image of this agency.
Well, nobody knowsabout the ham stunt,
So our image remainspretty much whereyou left it.
I wont need you inthe Jantzen presentation.
- Now youre being spiteful.- No.
I just think it wouldbe better not to havea girl in the room.
You know something?
We are all here because of you.
All we want to dois please you.
Why dont I put themin the pantry?
Christmas is around the corner.
Pauline:Put them in the basement.
Did the childrenlike their gifts?
They did.
Its nice the holiday ismemorable in some other way.
Im sorry a little girlspoiled your Thanksgiving.
Next time Ill tell hernot to get sick.
Ive raised childrenin my life, Henry.
Theyre terrified of her.
You dont knowany of the peopleyoure talking about.
Well, I knowwhat you see in her.
And you could have gotten itwithout marrying.
Why cant yougive her a chance?
- She loves you.- Shes a silly woman.
Honestly, Henry,
I dont know how you can standliving in that mans dirt.
Don:You go to the swimming pool,you go to the beach,
Take off your robe,you head into the cabana.
Theres no other wayto slice it, youregetting undressed.
Can I put my feet on this?
- Pretend likeits your living room.- Thank you.
What separates a bathing suitfrom underwear?
The cut and the printof the cloth
and some sort ofgentlemens agreement.
"so well built,
We cant show youthe second floor."
I think thatsa little suggestive.
Good. Thats whatI was going for.
A wink, but its not a leer.
We dont want a wink.
I think I explainedour product is formodest people.
Modest people wantto be stimulated too.
This draws them in in a way
That will make your competitorsseem crude and obvious.
Plus theyll be dyingto see the suit.
Theyll be dyingto see the girl.
And for all we knowshes not even wearing a top.
Youll get them into the store.
Isnt that the point?
Its not wholesome.
Its not...did I tell you werea family company?
I think I know whatyoure looking for.
A couple of womenbouncing a beach ball,
Little girl in front of thembuilding a sandcastle.
Your competitors aregonna keep k*ll you
Because youre too scaredof the skin
That your two-piecewas designed to show off.
Well, its somehow dirtier
Not seeing anything.
You need to decide what kindof company you want to be...
Comfortable and deador risky and possibly rich.
All I know iswe dont want that.
Well, gentlemen,you were wondering whata creative agency looks like,
There you have it.
Hope you enjoyedlooking in the window.
Give me a minute.
Where are you going?
Control yourself.
Now cool off.
Hopefully Campbell can talkthem into hearing a few moreideas in a week or so.
What?No.
Thats not the point.
Out.Get out.
- Don.- Excuse me?
Get your things and get outof my office now.
- Come on, lets go.- ( snaps fingers )
Call Bert Coopers manat "the wall street journal."
( slams door )
Theres always a namein every partnership
That defines who they are.
In the case of sterlingCooper draper Pryce
Would you saythats Donald draper?
Yes.
Really?
Last year our agencywas being swallowed whole.
I realized I had two choices.
I could die of boredom
Or holster up my g*n.
So I walked into lane Prycesoffice and I said,
"fire us."
Two days laterwe were operating outof the Pierre hotel.
Within a year we hadtaken over two floorsof the time-life building.
