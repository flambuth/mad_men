- Butter.- And the apples are good now,
but not from the market.
I can go to Rodney Farms on Sunday.Its near church.
- Cant we go to Rodney Farms?- Well see.
- Why dont we go to church?- We go to church.
On Christmas.Carla goes every Sunday.
We dont need to go every week.
Anything else?
- Its early. Do you want a drink?- Yes.
- How was school today?- Good.
How come you never ask me?
I do. Its just your answer is always longer,so I thought I would start with Sally.
Whens Halloween?
Before Thanksgiving.Francine and Carlton have invited us,
but I think if were going to beselling Daddys house,
I dont know, it might be niceto have it there one last time.
Are you going to sleep here tonight?
No.
Youre working too much.
- Betts, I dont have a choice.- No, thats not what I mean. I just...
I see how hard youre working.
Hello.
Inside.
- Were you grading papers?- Why?
I dont know if youre hungry,but I made date nut bread.
Actually, I made three. Bake sale.
Your service called.Mr. Hilton was looking for you,
but hes probably in the air right now.
Thanks, Miss Farrell. Thats good to know.
I thought so.
I want you to spend the whole night.
You couldnt possibly be asleep already.
This eight-year-old, Charlie,
looked up at me during art today and said,
"How do I know if what I see as blueis the same as it is to you?"
What did you say?
The truth. I dont know.
I never have,
but I love that he made methink about that again.
What would you have said?
I would have told Charlie
that my job is about
boiling down communicationto its essentials,
and that I know that there is a blue
that at least 45% of the populationsees as the same.
Maybe half those people thinktheyre looking at yellow.
Maybe, but the truth is,people may see things differently,
but they dont really want to.
Do you feel bad about what you do?
Nobody feels as good about what they doas you do.
Thats sweet.
I wish I couldve known you at eight.I bet you were serious.
And I wouldve liked you.
Long curly hair.
No one has it anymore.
- Why dont you take her?- Because I said no.
- Youd rather not go than go with me?- What do you think Mr. Draper would say
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper40th with his secretary?
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
- Coffee?- Morning, Don.
Morning, fellas. Yes.
- Aqua Net, 9:00.- Get Peggy.
Don, if you could stand over there.
Its Paul Kinsey theater.
This was my thought.
Aqua Net is about hold,but its also about beauty.
So, were driving. Two couples.I call it "Double Date. "
The woman in the backs scarf blows offand her hair starts blowing.
- Her hairdo falls apart.- Oh, no!
And then the woman in fronttakes off her scarf
and hands it back to the woman in the back.
- Take mine.- And he says, "Are you sure, Marcia?"
Marcias hair is perfect.
And then her date gives hera knowing smile of admiration
on her confident smile.
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style. "
Too much story.Every time I hear, "And then,"
theres another chancefor the ladies at home to misunderstand.
What if its just the two couples,the wind is blowing,
the woman in the backhas to put on her kerchief
and she just looks longinglyat Miss Perfect in front?
- Okay.- "Arrive in style" still works.
And at the end,you could see the can with a kerchief,
like a see-through one over it
and the wind blows it offto reveal the Aqua Net.
A kerchief in a can?
Dont use that, but very nice.
Well, great, then.
- What do you have for Western Union?- We dont meet until next week.
Hilton takes precedence,
so I need you two to be ready for meat a moments notice.
And it has to be TVto compete with the phone company.
I love getting telegrams,but I never send them.
How is that supposed to help?
Ive got it.
My goodness. This is where everyone is.
Allison, my dear, do you mind?
All the paperwork is throughon your contract.
It is my pleasureto deliver your signing bonus personally.
You see, I dont just fire people.
So we finally have an answerto the question,
"What makes Don Draper smile?"$5,000 seems to be the number.
I dont know why it took two months.
Will your amigo Connie Hiltonbe attending the anniversary party Friday?
- In his dressiest Stetson.- Splendid.
You will be speaking last.Its prime time. Please prepare.
Im sorry to interrupt.Mr. Pryce, your wife is here
and has requestedyour attention immediately.
- Where?- Your office.
- Whats going on?- Ill find out.
No, its okay.
- Mr. Kinsey to see you.- What was that?
Thank you, Olive. What?
I dont need you to put your little swirlon top of my idea.
- No ones keeping score.- I am.
And every time we work together,it looks like you carried the load
because youre spontaneous,and youre a girl,
and youre his favoriteand you use Aqua Net.
- Are you nuts? He hates me.- Thats rich.
Wearing a dress isnt gonna help youwith Western Union.
You do your work. Ill do mine.Let the chips fall where they may.
Mrs. Pryce, your water.
- Thank you ever so much, John.- Will there be anything else?
- Hes such a toad.- He is. He is. Darling, please, sit down.
No. Im not going to let you force meto do anything anymore.
Am I to entertainyour ballad of dissatisfaction,
or has something actually happened?Because I am at work, dear.
Im so sorry.
I went to pick up my gown.
The queue for the taxi was 10 longwith those fat ladies in their furs.
Finally I think Im en route,but I see the park,
and I insist its the wrong direction,
and hes obviously running up my fare,which he was.
- Im so sorry, darling.- I had to stop here
because Id already takena $2.25 tour of Harlem
- and that was all the money I had.- Well get you home right away.
Do you have enough cashto get me to London?
Because this is not my home.
- These things take time.- Not for you.
If a superior demands that you be happy,you say, "Yes, sir. Right away, sir. "
Go on. Lets have it all, shall we?
You like it here.
The smells and the noiseand the criminals at every level.
I have made the best of this.
My salary is good.The company is flourishing.
My wife has a beautiful gown.
May I see it?
Its not London.
- Its not even England.- Thats true.
Ive been here 10 monthsand no ones ever asked me
where I went to school.
- I want to scream.- Dont.
Roll over.
- Just a minute!- Why did you answer?
I had to see you.
I called you from the bus stationin New Haven
before I started hitching.You never answered.
Im so sorry. Can you give me a minute?
- Its my brother.- Get rid of him for 15 minutes. Ill run out.
No, its okay, Don. Come outside.
No. So theres a man in here.He doesnt need to know its me.
I want you to meet him.
I dont want to ruin this.
Its okay.
I promise.
Danny, Id like you to meet my friend Don.
- Sorry to interrupt.- Danny, be polite.
I really am sorry.
- What happened there?- Is it bad under there? Are you hungry?
- No.- Well, I should be going.
Listen, I know what it looks like,but Im not a junkie.
Although apparently Im too dangerousto push a cart in a public library.
- He has fits.- Im sorry.
I interrupted you. Its a nice night.
- Ill see you in the morning, Suzy.- Stop it.
- I wish you the best.- You dont even know me.
- Ill call you.- Tomorrow.
He couldve just stayedinside your bedroom.
I wanted you two to meet.Youre my baby brother.
Well, he knows how to leave a room.Reminds me of Mom.
- Hes just very private.- Hes arrogant. His plans were interrupted.
You dont know him.
Im going to get you another job.Someplace safe.
Safe.
Other people are the problem.Name such a place.
People are ignorant.
Theyre scared of thingsthey dont understand.
Im really hungry.
1923. We were giddy.
We didnt know the soupwas gonna hit the fan,
- but we made it through.- All these guys are dead.
Except you, of course.
And Doug Thompson, but I wish he were.He let me eat a whole roll of Bolls Laxatives.
I thought they were candies.I want him to show up and keel over.
Damn it.I dont want to go to another funeral.
Well, Im not really gonna k*ll him.I just would like to, thats all.
Fortieth anniversary.Forty would be an insignificant year
were it not the average lifespanof a man in this business.
I dont think its a bad idea to have a chanceto out-drink your clientele.
Who am I kidding?I dont want to go either.
Have to watch Don Draperaccept an award for his humanity?
- Don is important.- You know, I found that guy
working in a fur company, night school.
And that girl, Betty.
I remember Mona said they looked likethey were on top of our wedding cake.
- Screw him.- Have the party without me. I cant do it.
I wont.
Okay. Okay.
Its just a party. If you dont want to go,you dont have to go.
Its not likeits our company anymore anyway.
My God. Remember her?
Its 100,000 bucks...
- Can I?- If you do it right.
Hello, Draper residence.
Hello?
Theres nobody there. They hanged up.
Hang it up.
Whyd they hang up?
Probably a wrong number.People do it all the time.
But I could hear somebodyand they heard me.
My goodness, Sally Draper,try not to take everything so personally.
Jeez Louise.
The phone is cheap.Its everyday, and you cant trust it.
The telegraph is honest and solid and clear.Its old, but its good.
Traditional.
Sorry about that, Olive.
Peggy.
- Peggy!- Hello?
- Did you see a girl come through here?- No, sir.
- Im Paul, by the way.- Im Achilles.
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.
- Are you okay?- Are you Greek?
- Im an American citizen.- No, of course.
Its just, thats a mighty big name.
- How did that happen?- Well, its been in my family for generations.
When we have a partyand someone says, "Achilles,"
all the men turn their heads.
- In fact, one Christmas...- Hush.
Ive got it.
Youve got what?
Achilles, I have thought of somethingvery, very good.
- Glad to hear it.- Its truly great news.
- Yeah, your whole face changed.- Did it?
Well, I think I shall sleepvery soundly tonight. I wish you the same.
Is that taken?
Hey.
Ill only stay for a stop.I tried to catch you on the platform.
- What are you doing here?- I needed to talk to you.
Did you call my house last night?
No, I didnt.
- This was a mistake.- Sit down.
Im sorry.
You said youd call me.
Your brother is there.
I dont care about your marriageor your work or any of that,
as long as I know youre with me.
Im sorry.
I got him a jobat the VA Hospital in Bedford.
Hell be pushing a broom,but it has nice grounds.
You can come by tonight. Hell be gone.
- Are you sure?- Stop it.
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!
It was nice meeting you.
Mr. Kinsey.
Paul!
Sorry to wake you. Its 9:00 a. m.
- Good morning, Lois.- Good morning.
I need you to type something for me.
- Were you in here before?- No.
- So you havent touched anything?- No.
You do that sometimes.
- What was it?- Does it look like I know?
I wrote it down.
I know I wrote it down.
Did you find it?Its always the last place you look.
My mother always saidto retrace your steps if you lost something.
Good God, would you shut up?
"In conclusion,with the help of Sterling Cooper,
"its ingenuity and influence,
"America is teaching businessto the world. "
Very rousing, sir.
Churchill rousing or h*tler rousing?
Mr. Pryces office.
Just a moment, please.
London calling. Mr. Ford.
- Harold.- Just calling for a status report
on our little party.
All is well, although as of late,Bert Cooper will be in absentia.
Well, that wont do.
Were flying across the pond.We expect all the flowers in the vase.
- What does that mean?- Look, Lane,
weve had interest in the companyfor some months
and this party is essentialto attracting a second suitor.
For what purpose?
Did we reach you at a bad time?You seem foggy.
- Saint John here.- Hello.
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.
But why?
Weve reduced the staffand increased the revenue by 22%.
I think youve answered your own question.We need this party to encourage interest.
- Do your best, lad.- Yes, of course.
- Are you quite all right, sir?- Yes. Thatll be all.
Henry Francis, please. Its Betty Draper.
How are you? What a nice surprise.
I was wonderingif you called my home last night.
No. No, I didnt.
Well, we had a hang-up.I thought it might be you.
Really?
Im terribly embarrassed.
Do you want me to call you?
- No.- But you thought it was me.
What are you laughing at?
I didnt call you and Im not going to,but if youre gonna call me, call me.
Dont make up excuses.
Im not playing a game here.
- Goodbye.- Goodbye, Betty.
Try to look at thisfrom Monicas point of view.
- Do you mind? This is rather serious.- Go ahead.
Monica wants to get marriedwith or without Jimmy...
It has come to my attention
that youre not attendingthe Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.
I wouldnt have told Rogerif I planned on it remaining a secret.
In Great Britain
we have a good deal of testimonials,
and the senior membersare all equally unenthused.


It marks the passage of time.Its painful, I imagine.
I didnt get to where I amby dwelling on the past.
So think of the future,all of our clients, all of our staff,
the press, newspapersand trade publications.
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.
You really pour the honey on,then you lick it off.
Well, if you care aboutSterling Cooper at all,
remember that your absencewill make everyone think you are ill.
Who told you I was vain?
Please.
Its obvious.
I want to show Mommy. Mommy!
- Maybe shes not here.- Carla.
- Are you feeling all right?- Im fine.
I want you to take the children to the park.Dont come home...
Just... Dinnertime would be perfect.Take them to the library.
Hello.
Im glad to see you.
Sorry again.
We were gonna leave after schooland I am still here, obviously.
You want to wait here for me?He has to report tomorrow.
Let me do it. Let me drive him.
- Where are you going again?- Bedford, Mass.
- Its a long drive, Don.- And youll have to come back alone.
Let me do this for you.
I dont want to say goodbye up there.Its gonna come out ungrateful.
Theres $375 there, okay?
How many times have you done this?
Dont you need to gas up?
- No, were fine.- So youre not gonna stop?
Do you need to stop?
I have some movie in my headwhere I give you the slip,
but I might as well tell you.Im not going to Bedford.
Well, I am, so I guess you kind of have to.
Why do you care?Youre just gonna go back and screw her.
I dont knowif youre capable of understanding,
- but that job is important.- Did you get me the job?
- No.- So shut up.
Im not retarded.Julius Caesar had epilepsy. He ran Rome.
Things didnt turn out so well for him.
I know whats waiting for me at that place.Im 25 years old, Don.
I dont want to be cleaning toiletsuntil I die.
Just pull over.
- Hold on.- What?
Im older than you,
and Im telling you it seems bad now,but you can still change things.
- Pull myself up by the bootstraps?- Does that just sound stupid to you?
How do I explain this?
I cant do anything that you can do.
Everyone knows, sooner or later,that theres something wrong with me.
Theyre kind and they try,
but then when I come towith piss in my pants,
they stare at melike Im from another planet.
I am afflicted, okay?
Its not a question of will.I cant change that.
- Do you need money?- Always.
I swore to myselfI would try to do this right once.
Do what?
I want you to call me if you ever need to.
And I want you to remember,
if something happens to you,your sister will never forgive herself.
Youre not gonna tell her, are you?
That I let you out20 miles outside of Framingham?
Take care.
I know he thought I was passing him off,but he means the world to me.
He knows that.
What was the place like?
- Nice.- Bullshit.
Hell be as good as he can be.
Don, I dont want to.
I dont.
Its okay.
- Coffee?- No.
Can you get my wife on the phone?
- Betty.- Where were you last night?
- I told you, I was with Hilton.- Well, I must have forgotten.
Well, did you rememberto pick up my tuxedo?
Yesterday. Its in the closet.
Ill get home at 5:30.We should leave within the hour.
I dont know.I dont know if Im going to go.
- Whats wrong?- "Whats wrong?"
"Whats wrong?"
I dont feel well.
Get into bed and grab a hot water bottle.You have seven hours.
Its all the clients and all the partners,and theyre all expecting me to show up
with the glamorous, elegant,stunning Betty Draper.
I want to show you off, Betts.
Okay.
You ready? Dons expecting us.
Ive got nothing.
- What a relief. Mines garbage, too.- No, I had something,
something incredible, but I lost it.
I didnt write it down.
- I hate that.- It mightve been the best idea I ever had.
I did everything. I talked to Achilles.
I spent last night recreatingevery detail of the evening,
hoping it would come back.
You know how it is.There was nothing and then there was it,
- and now its nothing again.- Im so sorry.
- How do you talk to Achilles?- Hes a janitor with a very bad memory.
You know what the Chinese say?
"The faintest ink is betterthan the best memory. "
Come on. Weve failed before.
Okay, we really looked for advantages.
One of them is,phone calls happen every day.
A telegrams a big deal.Something like, "Shes getting married.
"Are you really just goingto give her a call?"
Sounds like youre talking to her parents.They should really be at that wedding.
Also, old people love them.
- "When you care, send one there. "- Thats a slogan, not an idea. Paul?
- Mine arent any better.- Damn it, Kinsey. Whats your excuse?
- Dont yell at him.- Excuse me?
Tell him what happened.
No.
The dog ate my homework.I had a great idea and I lost it.
I didnt write it down.
I hate when that happens.
I keep thinking about that Chinese thingyou said. What was it?
"The faintest ink is betterthan the best memory. "
It just makes me think...You call someone on the phone,
"Hello, Im getting married"or, "Congratulations on the baby,"
and then you hang up. Its gone.
Its different if you send a telegram.A telegram is permanent.
Something like, "A telegram is forever. "
"You cant frame a phone call. "
My God.
Thats the way to go.You two keep working on that.
When do you want it?
The partys tonight. Monday.
See? It all works out.
Betts, are you ready?
- The cars downstairs.- The drivers Chinese.
Ready, Betts?
Look how pretty Mommy is.
- Where are we going?- The Waldorf Astoria, Mummy.
Well, then we passed it.Its on Fifth Avenue.
Its on Park. Moved years ago.
Thats right. Thats right.When did they ever do that?
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.
Theyll change itand never give you a reason.
Mummy, shes not Margaret, shes Jane.Shes my wife.
- Does Mona know?- Yes, she knows.
You seem surprised that theres traffic.Theres always traffic.
Calm yourself. Well arrive when we arrive.
- Theyre selling the company.- What?
Theyre selling Sterling Cooper.
- When?- I have no idea.
- What happens to the Americans?- Theyll go to the highest bidder.
I know you hate uncertainty,
but take comfort in the factthat well return to England.
Im gonna keep going onand make Don Draper wait,
because God knowsweve all waited for him.
As if being decoratedfor his service in Korea werent enough,
his career has yielded even more awards.
The American Association of AdvertisingAgencies Arthur Kudner Award,
Printers Ink magazinesadvertising gold medal,
the Advertising Writers Associationof New York... Im not reading all of these.
Hes loyal, charming, quiet but not modest.Why should he be?
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,
and his three children,for sharing him with us,
because as we all know, sometimesSterling Cooper has gotten the lions share.
Bert Cooper and my father,Roger Sterling Sr.,
bravely set this in motion 40 years ago.
And now let me introduce the man
who will stand alongside mefor the next 40 years,
our creative director, partner,father, husband
and friend, Donald Draper.
Please. Please.
Please.
Im very honored.
