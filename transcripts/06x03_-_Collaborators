Previously on Mad Men...
Heinz beans.Some things never change.
Oh, its clever.
Were going to loseJaguar unless
an arrangement is made, and
it involves you and her.
You look radiant, Joan.
You must have heard some terriblethings about me from Don Draper.
Now, why would you want toplay for the other team?
Its not a game.
You dont get another chanceat what you have.
I have it all.
Here we go.
The one with the fur.
You know, I might just take youup on those theater tickets.
- You must see "Hair."- Oh, you like that?
- Who doesnt?- What is it?
Oh, its just filledwith profanity,
marijuana smoking,and simulated sexual acts.
Simulated?
And a few songs.
The two holidaychairmanships that remain
are the 4th of Julyblock party,
which really consists ofcalling the fire department,
or the Labor DaySoap Box Derby,
which consistsof calling the hospital.
Which one do you do?
Our family has claimedthe Easter egg hunt.
Do you dress as a bunny?
Maybe a little cottontail?
Its very wholesome.
Mm-hmm.
Id like to surprise Dougfor his birthday.
Maybe you could get methe tickets in secret.
Arrangements could be made.
Just pick a dateand ring me up.
I have to warn you,Im from a small town
and all of my forays intoManhattan have been a disaster.
Well make a deal.
Brave your way to Grand Central
and Ill hand off the ticketsand throw in a hot dog.
You have another one of those?
But youve alreadyseen "Hair."
Maybe I want to see it again.
Oh, there you are.
Gentlemen, its beena pleasure.
Thank you bothfor your hospitality.
- Thank you again.- It was lovely.
Consider what I saidabout the pool.
That is the endof the welcome wagon.
Well basically have to move to getsomeone to make dinner for us.
What was that about the pool?
Hes insistent we allgo skinny-dipping.
Ha! Let him gethis own pool.
Turn it off.
I need to put it in themail today and the tailor.
Sylvia, sweetheart--
- Good morning.- Morning.
Morning.
- Honey.- Oh, Im sorry.
Ill swing bythe bank at lunch.
I give her cash every month,
but I think shes secretlysending it all to our kid.
You donthave to explain anything.
Youre lucky your wife works.
She doesnt earn much.
Not yet.
I forgot my cigarettes.
You got to stop that nonsense.
Listen, dont worry about dinner Wednesday.Well have money by then.
Looking forward to it.
I knew itd be you.
"Ive Got Five Dollars"playing in background
It wasnt all bad.I got me some memories.
And the boy.
Dont know what it is yet.
I mean Dick here.
Well, hello there.
This is Mack. Hes withme, so hes your uncle.
We thank the Lord foropening your rooms to us.
All I said was, "My sisterscoming with her boy."
Macks the one that brung ya.
Id do the same for mine.
And, of course,Ernestine told you
we could always usea little help around here.
Lets get you off your feet.
Dick, you help Mackwith the bags.
You keep your eyes down andmind your own business here.
Good-looking kid.He yours?
Not that I know.
Little boy, find your own sins.
Stay away from Macks.
Afternoon, Charlotte.
Hey, kid, you were raisedon a farm, am I right?
Yes, sir.
Well, Im the roosteraround here, understand?
You help all the hens?
And Ill bring on the day.
I feel bad.
You should.I have to go to work.
You get to sleep.
No, about dinner.
I thought there was no smoking.
I just found outthe maid smokes.
She doesnt sleepin here, does she?
You dont mind sittingacross the table
from your wife and my husband?
I dont think about it.
Theyre both good company.
They are.
I suppose that hasnothing to do with this.
This didnt happen.
Just in here.
Youre right.
I only said yes becauseArnold wants to impress you.
I only said yes becauseMegan keeps asking.
- She likes you.- And I like her.
Its 9:00.I have to go.
You love to go.
Well, its nice to knowthat no matter what
we got something done today.
You found it in the cookie jar.
I have money,I just never have money.
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Giffordare waiting outside.
Why didnt you tell me?
Because they dontwant to come in.
Look, Phyllis,Ive had their job.
I know. And youvehad my job, too.
So you know it wouldnt hurtif you were to act like--
if you were as encouragingto them as you are to me.
Why dont you just get mewhatever book you read
and save methese little lectures?
More coffee?
Shes ready for you.
Have a seat.
- No, dont.- Whats wrong with them?
The strategy is Clearasilstops blemishes
that keep you from having fun.
That means no oneshould be having fun.
Okay.
So well just start over.
Just a minute.
I dont want you to thinkthat just because
I have high standards
that means Im not happywith you.
Especially, you know,the way you are.
The way you arehas nothing to do
with the factthat the work needs work.
Thank you, Coach.Well try our best.
There you go.
Please, dear,dont linger in the hallway.
Your coat?
Can I get you something to eat?
I think I have some peanutsand some cheese crackers.
No, thank you.
Perhaps something to drink?
I have bourbon, vodka,
gin, champagne.
I shouldnt.I started on the train.
What kind of music do you like?
None for me.
Is the temperature okay?
Yes.
Hmm.
Its been known to get hot.
Im fine.
Thats a pretty shadeof lipstick.
Thank you.
Im glad you came.
Come with me.
DDB managed to get meon the 50-yard line
for the Giants gamelast November.
If wed done it,the Steelers would have won.
Wed do anything to make you happy.
Im not unhappy with DDB.
No notes.
When I presented the numbersfor my division,
Timmy came up to me and said,"How the hell did you do that?"
So I figured hes in town,
why not take himto the horses mouth?
The past few years,
Ive overseen ketchupto great success.
But how long beforewere old news?
And, hell, when I saw baked beanshave a sales spike like that...
Raymond has demandedour best work.
So then the question iswhat can we do for you?
What can we do for ketchup?
Let me know.
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.
This isnt an official visit.
Im just dropping by.
Ken, Don and I have a little beanshousekeeping, if you dont mind.
Id love to walk you out.
Raymond, were gratefulfor this opportunity
and consider itquite a vote of confidence.
It is, but I dont want youto waste your time.
Well, then if nothing else,we appreciate the introduction.
Im not winking here.
There is to beno further communication
with Timmy or his division.
Im sorry, Raymond. Did wedo something to upset you?
You guys are doinga bang-up job.
And now that polished Polackwants the same.
Ill take that drink.
No ones paid attention to mein nine years at the company.
They gave me a su1c1de mission.
Vinegar, sauces,and baked beans.
And then in my momentof triumph, he comes up to me
and he didnt say,"How did you do that?"
He said,"How did you do that?"
Smug bastard.
I taught himeverything he knows.
- We understand, Raymond.- No, forget it.
I know ketchupsthe gold standard,
but after all weve been through,Im sure I dont need to tell you
that if you so much as sendhim a ham at Christmas,
well, Id rather retire
than watch that guyscrew my girlfriend.
- Let me walk you out.- No.
If he lingered at all,
Im gonna pretend Im onmy way to the mens room.
Im sorry.What a waste of time.
I dont know.We met Timmy.
- Hes certainly going places.- Raymonds so weak.
But he brought his business herewhen we were barely standing.
Its Heinz Ketchup, Don.
Its the Coca-Colaof condiments.
I know.
But sometimes youve got to dancewith the one that brung ya.
Im afraid thats the endof your toilet paper.
This place could really usea womans touch.
You think so?
I might come to town Friday.
Theres alwaysa sale at Macys.
Well see.
Okay, Ill call you.
If I let the phone ring once andhang up, then youll know its me.
Dont do that.
Well, Im going to park my car
in front of the drivewayinstead of in the driveway.
Then youll knowIm thinking of you.
Thats sweet.
I really have to get back.
Can you move it along a little?
You told me you werewashing these by hand.
- No wonder the elastic is sh*t.- I forgot.
And you forgot you leftthe vacuum on the terrace.
I was changing the bag.
And you forgot not to useS.O.S on the Teflon.
I mean, I leavefor work every day
and I wonder what youregoing to ruin in my house.
Im so sorry,Mrs. Draper.
I dont know how to dothis, but youre fired.
Ill get my things.
- Im sorry.- No.
I am. I walked in on it andthen I didnt want to pretend.
Are you okay, honey?
No.
Come on.Lets go upstairs.
I dont wanna goup until shes gone.
Let her alonewith your silverware?
So, after weeks, I finally showed himthe picture of my mother...
but thats not enough, becauseher name has been changed in the will.
That is quite a story line.
Well, you asked.
- Its meaty, isnt it?- It is.
I just wish watching TVduring the day
didnt make me feel so guilty.
I had a miscarriage.
All right.I will watch.
No, in real life.
Two days ago.
Im so sorry to hear that.
Im sorry. I shouldntburden you with this.
No, you obviously need to talk.
I was sloppyin Hawaii--
the time difference, vacation.
Now I feel so guilty.
May I?
What do you haveto feel guilty about?
What did Don say?
I didnt tell him.
Its been a hardcouple of weeks.
Oh.
I dont know why.
I mean, I do.
You were raisedthe same way I was.
I keep hearingSister Eugenie in my head.
Im such a horrible person.
Youre not a horrible person.
No, I am.
I mean,
to be pregnant now
at this moment?
I didnt knowwhat I wanted to do
and I was so relieved that Ididnt have to do anything.
I see.
Has this ever happened to you?
About a year afterI had Mitchell.
So I certainly understandsome of what youre feeling.
But the rest of it,
no.
Im sorry.
Really?
Because I was raisedthe same way,
so I would never evenconsider that my decision.
You really believe that?
I do.
And I think you do, too,
or you wouldnt feel this way.
I just feel so shitty.
Im sorry I brought it up.
Hello.
Hello.
- Sylvias here.- I see that.
Hello.
I should be going.
You dont have to rush off.
- Have a drink.- No, Ill leave you two alone.
- I fired the maid today.- Good riddance.
Good night, both of you.
See you tomorrow.
- Excuse me?- For dinner.
Oh, of course.
Yes.
So send her in.
Sorry to bother you,but this was on my desk.
Is it new?
Theres usually a memofor everything around here.
- What is it?- Its Quest.
Feminine hygiene powder.
- Did I miss a meeting?- "Proof points--
has baking soda, makes younicer if youre stinky,
k*ll overlycritical bacteria."
"Target-- professionalwomen and other Olsons."
Just give it to me.
Calm down.
I think this is somebodysidea of a joke.
Of course, when you want themto be funny theyre useless.
Hello, gorgeous.
Hello, Herb.
Did you getall gussied up for me?
No.
I had no idea youd bedarkening my doorway.
When are you gonnacome out to the lot?
I told you, Ill let you have aJaguar for as long as you like.
I take the bus.
I know theres a part of youthats glad to see me.
And I know theres a part ofyou you havent seen in years.
Herb!There you are.
How are you today?
Toodle-oo.
Mrs. Harrisis here to see you.
Hes here.
Thank you.
- Who are you?- Im Bob Benson.
Weve met before.Im part of the team.
Doesnt the elevatorgo up to this floor?
Herb.
What brings you by?
I had some thoughts,the complexity of which
could not be expressedover a telephone.
What is it you want?
Well, you guys are gonnamake some fancy-schmancy
Michelangelo TV spotand the dealers
are gonna foot most ofthe bill for running it.
Thats how it works.
Well, Im the only guy actuallyout there selling hamburgers
and I want people to know theresa hamburger store in Englewood,
not England or in your mind.
I dont want another thing with someshmuck sitting on his lawn mower
fantasizing that hes gonna winthe Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.
I need foot traffic.
Get em in the doorso I can move metal.
Well, you, along withthe factory guys,
have already signed off onthe work as well as the buy.
I just think there shouldbe retail radio as well.
You know? "Does yourcar sound like this?"
Voom voom! "Does yourwife sound like this?"
"Ooh, I love your car."
And then you saythe phone number twice.
Wonderful.
Wed love to increasethe exposure of the campaign.
How much morewould you like to buy?
Theres no increase.Just adjust the proportions.
I think we should spend60% of the money
on local dealership adsinstead of national.
Herb, that would really take abite out of the national campaign.
Well, if you say so.
Unfortunately,its not up to me,
so I am suggesting
that you recommendthis plan to all of us.
Why dont you recommend it?Its your idea.
Because its an ideayou had yourself.
And Lord knowsyoure so damn persuasive.
We understand, Herb.
See how easy that was, Bob?
Bob, why dont youshow me the sights?
You must be like a kidin a candy store around here.
- You cant shake his hand?- He didnt seem interested.
In fact, the only thing he seemed interestedin was gutting our national campaign.
You do realize that defeatsthe purpose of having Jaguar?
So hes demandingand unreasonable.
How does that make him different from theother people who walk through that door?
I wish you would handle the clientsas well as youre handling me.
Jimmys Condom Warehouse
where the rubber meets the road.Jimmy speaking.
You want a drink?
No, thank you.Im quite comfortable.
How was your day, honey?
Okay.
Okay?What happened to Shangri-La?
Chaough quit crapping outsnow cones?
Everyone hates me here.
Well, that was bound to happen.
You worked for meand you like me.
- I worked with you.- I was tough but fair.
Oh, speaking of peoplewho hate you,
Raymond J. Beans came in todayand pulled a real boner.
Go on.
He brought inthe head of ketchup.
Hes obsessed with that man.
Yeah, he should be.I met him.
So Raymond makesthe introduction
and then, according to Ken, ketchupleaves, but Raymond lingers
and he says hes gonnak*ll the account and himself
if they even talkto ketchup again.
Whyd he bring him in?
Because hes Raymond.Hes a fraidycat.
And-- heres the partthats gonna make you happy--
Kenny spent two weekstelling everybody
how he was getting ketchup.
Okay, Tuesday morningis perfect.
What? Oh, yep.
Well have your wigready then, maam.
Youre allowed to makepersonal calls after 5:00,
especially if theymake you laugh.
My friend Stan wastelling me a funny story
- about one of our old clients.- What happened?
Oh, its complicated, but basicallythe guy from Heinz Baked Beans
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.
Of course he does.
Well, surprisingly,beans brought ketchup in
for a meeting at the agencyand everyone got excited,
and then unsurprisinglyhe sent ketchup out of the room
and told everyoneit was just for show.
So hes unhappy?
Hes not going anywhere.
Probably misses you.
No.
I assure you, he doesnt.
Theres nothing like things goingbadly when you leave, is there?
Sorry Im late.
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.
Im not feeling well.
Thats not where it hurts.
Oh.Did you cancel?
No, I thought Id feel betterby the time you got home.
Were supposed to be therein 15 minutes.
Theyre probably already there.
I know, but I dontwant to pretend
like Im having a good timeand its too late to cancel.
- Theyll survive.- I want you to go.
I want you to have fun.
Okay.
But you go right to bed.
Yes, sir.
Go away!
Somebody help me!
What on earth is that?
Somebody, please!
Somebody help!
- Oh, my goodness!- What happened to you?
Hey, Campbell,shes your problem now.
Im sorry. I didntknow where else to go.
- He was chasing me.- Close the door.
Hold this to your nose.
What the hell happened?
Im so embarrassed.
We had a terrible fight.
- Im going to call the authorities.- No, please.
Well, then Im taking youto the hospital.
- Ill be fine.- No, what do you think youre doing?
Youre not going back there.Peter, go to Tammys bathroom.
Theres some cotton wool.
Ill be right back.
I hope you haventbeen waiting long.
Oh, dont worry about it.I was late, too.
They already gave usa hard time.
- Wheres your wife? - She sends herregrets. She wasnt feeling well.
- Thats too bad.- You look lovely.
Lets get you a drink.
Well get the waiterto do the whole show again.
Im afraid theres onlygoing to be three of us.
- Don?- Old-fashioned, please.
Subito.
Well, the North Koreansreally took that ship.
And the Vietcong, did you seethem storming the embassy?
I havent followed it today.
- We got it back.- Still...
these two little pissant countrieshanding our head to us.
Well, I dont knowabout the ship,
but from what Ive read, the embassy wasan ambush that broke the cease-fire.
We gave them peacefor their sacred holiday.
Next thing we know,they cut us to ribbons.
Reminds me of Cuba.
No one tookFidel Castro seriously.
We thought he was Señor Wences.
Turns out he wasGeorge Washington.
And they say surgeonsare arrogant.
Who says that?
You know were losing the w*r.
Wouldnt know itfrom looking around here.
Yeah, its something, right?
- You are Dr. Rosen?- You see this service?
Yes. Wed like to hearthe spiel again.
Uh, scusi.There is a telephone call.
Really?
Ill be right back.
Im gonna take this as anopportunity to powder my nose.
Theres no answer.
Is there anyone else?Family?
My sisters back in Oneonta.
My mothers in Boca Raton.
Well, you cant go home.We should find a hotel.


Lets try some ice.
What did you say to him?
Hello? Yes.
Do you have anyvacancies this evening?
Take me to the city.I want to be with you.
Absolutely not.
Very good.Thank you.
The Old Greenwich has rooms.
- Can you take me there?- Well get you a taxi.
Nonsense.Ill drive you.
I dont know what I was thinking.Ill run you over.
Brenda, dear, lets go.Its best this way.
Emergency averted?
Unfortunately, no.
Sylvia and youare having dinner.
- This is silly.- We can do this another time.
Im not taking my foot out ofthe door of this restaurant.
Order for fouror theyll punish me.
Good luck.
What are you having?
I dont knowthat Im that hungry.
You want another glass of wine?Should we get a bottle?
Youre drinking something else.
I dont want you to have wineif you dont drink wine.
Im not gonna drinka whole bottle, obviously.
I dont knowhow obvious that is.
Another glass is fine.
So what looks good here?
Depends what you want.
Well, Im hungry,Im in a good mood,
and Id like some guidance on theItalian menu from my favorite Italian.
I didnt cook it, so I cantspeak to its quality.
You think Id likeeggplant rollatinis?
For the lovely signora?
- Were not ready yet.- Yes, we are.
Can she haveanother glass of wine
and could you give us a minute?
Certo.
Whats wrong?
How could I possibly knowwhat you like to eat?
I thought you werelooking forward to this.
I dont know what were doing.
Were having dinner together.
And Im sorry, but I guessit was a stupid idea to think
we could spend time togetheroutside of your maids room.
Just because they clearedtheir place settings
doesnt mean were alone.
Is that whats bothering you?
That everythingworked out perfectly?
And you enjoy how foolishthey both look.
Now I understand.
You want to feel shitty
right up until the pointwhere I take your dress off.
Because Im going to do that.
You want to skip dinner?Fine. But dont pretend.
"Casta Diva - Norma1st Act" playing
And what if she had come?
The evening would bejust the same,
only it would besomeone elses dress?
What are you talking about?
Werent you the one who toldme you were drifting apart?
Isnt that what this was about?
I want you.
I want you all the time.
But if youve suddenly decided youwant something more than that,
well, then,thats news, isnt it?
So, have you decided?
I dont know.Have you?
Hell have the steak diavolo
and Ill have the branzino.
Anything to start?
No. Were in a bit of a hurry.
Im sorry.
Im so sorry.
I have no right to be jealous.
This is just us here tonight.
We have to be careful.We cant fall in love.
It wont be so French anymore.
Hi, this is Johnny Carson.As you know,
this is the usual starting timefor "The Tonight Show."
And tonight my guest is the New Orleansdistrict attorney Mr. Jim Garrison,
who is with us to discuss,as he puts it,
some new and vital informationconcerning the Kennedy assassination.
But because of the criticalw*r situation in Vietnam,
especially around Saigon,NBC for the next 15 minutes
is going to bring you a specialnews program via satellite.
So stay with us.Well return in 15 minutes
with our guestMr. Garrison.
Did you have fun?
Arnold had an emergency,
so Sylvia and Ihad to eat enough
to keep himin good graces there.
Are you feeling better?
I need to talk to you.
Whats wrong?
Um...
Well, I had a miscarriage
a few days ago.
Are you okay?
Did you go to the doctor?
Yes.
How far along were you?
Six weeks.
I wish you would have told me.
I guess I didnt knowhow youd feel.
I didnt know what youd want.
Megan, you have to knowId want what you want.
Is that what you want?
Of course it is.
But I dont know that its even
the right time to havea conversation about it.
And I guess thats whyI didnt tell you.
But I should have.
Yes, you should have.
Do you want to havethat conversation?
Whatever you want.
Now I can go to sleep.
Good morning.
- Wheres Tammy?- Leticia took her to the park.
Oh.
Well, Im off.
Couldnt you just pretend?
I let you have that apartment.
Somehow I thoughtthat there was some dignity
in granting permission.
All I wanted wasfor you to be discreet.
She lives on our block!
Trudy, dont jumpto conclusions.
Theres no wayfor me to escape.
To not be an object of pity
while you get to dowhatever you feel like.
I have never said no to you.
That is not true.What are we doing out here?
Were done, Peter.This is over.
You want a divorce?
I refuse to be a failure.
I dont carewhat you want anymore.
This is how its going to work.
You will be here only whenI tell you to be here.
Im drawing a 50-mileradius around this house
and if you so much as open your flyto urinate, I will destroy you.
Do you understand?
You know what?
Youre going to goto bed alone tonight
and youre going to realize youdont know anything for sure.
Ill live with that.
- Good morning.- Good morning.
So far this is all we have,
but I want you to find outeverything you can on Heinz Ketchup.
What?
And this is not a joke.
No.I cant do that.
Why not?
Its a little bit of a secret,
but it turns outtheyre taking meetings.
I told you that secretand I shouldnt have.
Look, everybodys gonna know.We just know a little sooner.
My friend told me thatin confidence.
Hes not your friend.
- Hes the enemy.- Well, he doesnt know that.
Maybe you need a friendmore than you need a job.
I didnt know that.Im in advertising.
Its not that.
Its just that it wasa private conversation.
What are you, his priest?This is how wars are won.
Your friends mistakewas underestimating you.
I hope ketchup makes the samemistake so you can blow their mind.
So, correct meif Im wrong, Pete.
I certainly will.
Youre suggestingthat we forego
this sparklingnational ad campaign
in favor of hard-driving salesads at the local dealer level?
Not exactly. We will stillhave a national presence
with the sophisticated work thatDon presented and you loved,
but we will increasesales with a surgical
and financial focuson local media.
Well, that sounds good to me. Ofcourse, Im a little bit biased.
Why would we do that?
We feel its best to have aplan that creates customers,
not just aficionados.
Don, are you really in favor
of throwingour emphasis into radio?
Well, its hard to argue
with a more direct appealto customers.
I mean, we can artsy upthe image of Jaguar,
make it look romanticand stylish,
but isnt it betterto tell people
who are actuallyin the market for a car
that a Jaguar is available?
I thinkits an exciting new angle
to use direct saleson a luxury vehicle.
I mean, forget about radio.
How about a mailer
or a circularin the Sunday paper?
I dont know if thatswhat we had in mind.
So this is your recommendation?
I think its better to
think about someonein New Jersey
driving in their current car
and hearing thatright around the corner
theres a Jaguar to buyat a low, low price.
I bet the numbers would supportthat dont they, Harry?
That...
is really a statistics game.
You know what?I will have to double-check.
Look, why are youlimiting yourself?
Wouldnt you rathercast a wide net
so you can sell Jaguarto the average guy?
You know, truck drivers,housewives.
I was under the impressionfrom the work you showed us
that this would bea more elegant approach
that made the Jaguar seem rarebecause, lets face it,
the gentleman who buys our carneeds to be of some means.
I am 100% positive
that this approach moves cars.
And not just Jaguars. This isproven to move all kinds of cars.
Hell, even used cars.Am I wrong, Herb?
No, hes right.It moves cars.
Gentlemen, we appreciatethe recommendation,
but we believe we shouldstay with the proposal
as first discussed.
And as persuasiveas these arguments were,
that is how we willcontinue to proceed.
Lets not be too hasty.Maybe we should listen to them.
At least give it some thought.
Herbs right.
We still believe this is ourbest chance for success.
Fellas, this is gonna work.
Im sorry, but this isour final decision.
Thank you very much.
What the hell was that?
Herb, we couldnthave pushed any harder.
You pushed,then you let Don talk.
You should know better.The guys not a salesman.
That was the deftestself-immolation Ive ever seen.
I dont know whatyoure talking about.
I didnt know you werecapable of being that bad.
- What was that in there?- I wasnt feeling well.
Something about that guymakes me sick.
Dont be cute. I stillhave his spit in my hair.
Why cant youjust follow the rules?
I did. I did exactlywhat he asked for.
Not in spirit. You know damnwell that is not what he wanted.
Why do we carewhat that guy wants?
- Because hes a client.- Our client.
And so we just keepsaying yes no matter what
because we didnt say noto begin with?
You know what this is?Its Munich.
You guys are alwaystalking about Munich.
What the helldoes that mean anyway?
It means we gave the Germanswhatever they wanted
to make them happy, but itjust made them want more.
Well, who the hell won the w*r?
As my mother used to say,
your options weredishonor or w*r.
You chose dishonor,you might still get w*r.
That was Churchill.
First one in, last one out.
I dont know how you do it.
Me either.
Well, it cant be that bad whenyoure doing something that you love.
Im glad it lookslike that to you.
I spent a year in finance
watching identical menin identical suits
sneak drinks outof a desk drawer
while countingother peoples money.
What house?
My familys been atBrown Brothers Harriman
for three generations.
You make thislook a lot better.
Its all about what itlooks like, isnt it?
Im going down to the deli.
Can I get you something?
No, thank you.
Bob.
My wife asked meand I seem to have forgotten.
Could you pick me upsome toilet paper?
I got it, chief.
Good evening.
Hes home. You cant knockon the door like that.
I was taking the trash outand you left it open.
Tomorrow morning.
