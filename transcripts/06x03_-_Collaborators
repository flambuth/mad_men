Previously on Mad Men...
Heinz beans. Some things never change.
Oh, it's clever.
We're going to lose Jaguar unless
an arrangement is made, and
it involves you and her.
You look radiant, Joan.
You must have heard some terrible things about me from Don Draper.
Now, why would you want to play for the other team?
It's not a game.
You don't get another chance at what you have.
I have it all.
Here we go.
The one with the fur.
You know, I might just take you up on those theater tickets.
- You must see "Hair." - Oh, you like that?
- Who doesn't? - What is it?
Oh, it's just filled with profanity,
marijuana smoking, and simulated sexual acts.
Simulated?
And a few songs.
The two holiday chairmanships that remain
are the 4th of July block party,
which really consists of calling the fire department,
or the Labor Day Soap Box Derby,
which consists of calling the hospital.
Which one do you do?
Our family has claimed the Easter egg hunt.
Do you dress as a bunny?
Maybe a little cottontail?
It's very wholesome.
Mm-hmm.
I'd like to surprise Doug for his birthday.
Maybe you could get me the tickets in secret.
Arrangements could be made.
Just pick a date and ring me up.
I have to warn you, I'm from a small town
and all of my forays into Manhattan have been a disaster.
We'll make a deal.
Brave your way to Grand Central
and I'll hand off the tickets and throw in a hot dog.
You have another one of those?
But you've already seen "Hair."
Maybe I want to see it again.
Oh, there you are.
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.
Thank you both for your hospitality.
- Thank you again. - It was lovely.
Consider what I said about the pool.
That is the end of the welcome wagon.
We'll basically have to move to get someone to make dinner for us.
What was that about the pool?
He's insistent we all go skinny-dipping.
Ha! Let him get his own pool.
Turn it off.
I need to put it in the mail today and the tailor.
Sylvia, sweetheart--
- Good morning. - Morning.
Morning.
- Honey. - Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll swing by the bank at lunch.
I give her cash every month,
but I think she's secretly sending it all to our kid.
You don't have to explain anything.
You're lucky your wife works.
She doesn't earn much.
Not yet.
I forgot my cigarettes.
You got to stop that nonsense.
Listen, don't worry about dinner Wednesday. We'll have money by then.
Looking forward to it.
I knew it'd be you.
"I've Got Five Dollars" playing in background
It wasn't all bad. I got me some memories.
And the boy.
Don't know what it is yet.
I mean Dick here.
Well, hello there.
This is Mack. He's with me, so he's your uncle.
We thank the Lord for opening your rooms to us.
All I said was, "My sister's coming with her boy."
Mack's the one that brung ya.
I'd do the same for mine.
And, of course, Ernestine told you
we could always use a little help around here.
Let's get you off your feet.
Dick, you help Mack with the bags.
You keep your eyes down and mind your own business here.
Good-looking kid. He yours?
Not that I know.
Little boy, find your own sins.
Stay away from Mack's.
Afternoon, Charlotte.
Hey, kid, you were raised on a farm, am I right?
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm the rooster around here, understand?
You help all the hens?
And I'll bring on the day.
I feel bad.
You should. I have to go to work.
You get to sleep.
No, about dinner.
I thought there was no smoking.
I just found out the maid smokes.
She doesn't sleep in here, does she?
You don't mind sitting across the table
from your wife and my husband?
I don't think about it.
They're both good company.
They are.
I suppose that has nothing to do with this.
This didn't happen.
Just in here.
You're right.
I only said yes because Arnold wants to impress you.
I only said yes because Megan keeps asking.
- She likes you. - And I like her.
It's 9:00. I have to go.
You love to go.
Well, it's nice to know that no matter what
we got something done today.
You found it in the cookie jar.
I have money, I just never have money.
Mr. Mathis and Mr. Gifford are waiting outside.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because they don't want to come in.
Look, Phyllis, I've had their job.
I know. And you've had my job, too.
So you know it wouldn't hurt if you were to act like--
if you were as encouraging to them as you are to me.
Why don't you just get me whatever book you read
and save me these little lectures?
More coffee?
She's ready for you.
Have a seat.
- No, don't. - What's wrong with them?
The strategy is Clearasil stops blemishes
that keep you from having fun.
That means no one should be having fun.
Okay.
So we'll just start over.
Just a minute.
I don't want you to think that just because
I have high standards
that means I'm not happy with you.
Especially, you know, the way you are.
The way you are has nothing to do
with the fact that the work needs work.
Thank you, Coach. We'll try our best.
There you go.
Please, dear, don't linger in the hallway.
Your coat?
Can I get you something to eat?
I think I have some peanuts and some cheese crackers.
No, thank you.
Perhaps something to drink?
I have bourbon, vodka,
gin, champagne.
I shouldn't. I started on the train.
What kind of music do you like?
None for me.
Is the temperature okay?
Yes.
Hmm.
It's been known to get hot.
I'm fine.
That's a pretty shade of lipstick.
Thank you.
I'm glad you came.
Come with me.
DDB managed to get me on the 50-yard line
for the Giants game last November.
If we'd done it, the Steelers would have won.
We'd do anything to make you happy.
I'm not unhappy with DDB.
No notes.
When I presented the numbers for my division,
Timmy came up to me and said, "How the hell did you do that?"
So I figured he's in town,
why not take him to the horse's mouth?
The past few years,
I've overseen ketchup to great success.
But how long before we're old news?
And, hell, when I saw baked beans have a sales spike like that...
Raymond has demanded our best work.
So then the question is what can we do for you?
What can we do for ketchup?
Let me know.
A pleasure to meet you, Timmy.
This isn't an official visit.
I'm just dropping by.
Ken, Don and I have a little beans housekeeping, if you don't mind.
I'd love to walk you out.
Raymond, we're grateful for this opportunity
and consider it quite a vote of confidence.
It is, but I don't want you to waste your time.
Well, then if nothing else, we appreciate the introduction.
I'm not winking here.
There is to be no further communication
with Timmy or his division.
I'm sorry, Raymond. Did we do something to upset you?
You guys are doing a bang-up job.
And now that polished Polack wants the same.
I'll take that drink.
No one's paid attention to me in nine years at the company.
They gave me a su1c1de mission.
Vinegar, sauces, and baked beans.
And then in my moment of triumph, he comes up to me
and he didn't say, "How did you do that?"
He said, "How did you do that?"
Smug bastard.
I taught him everything he knows.
- We understand, Raymond. - No, forget it.
I know ketchup's the gold standard,
but after all we've been through, I'm sure I don't need to tell you
that if you so much as send him a ham at Christmas,
well, I'd rather retire
than watch that guy screw my girlfriend.
- Let me walk you out. - No.
If he lingered at all,
I'm gonna pretend I'm on my way to the men's room.
I'm sorry. What a waste of time.
I don't know. We met Timmy.
- He's certainly going places. - Raymond's so weak.
But he brought his business here when we were barely standing.
It's Heinz Ketchup, Don.
It's the Coca-Cola of condiments.
I know.
But sometimes you've got to dance with the one that brung ya.
I'm afraid that's the end of your toilet paper.
This place could really use a woman's touch.
You think so?
I might come to town Friday.
There's always a sale at Macy's.
We'll see.
Okay, I'll call you.
If I let the phone ring once and hang up, then you'll know it's me.
Don't do that.
Well, I'm going to park my car
in front of the driveway instead of in the driveway.
Then you'll know I'm thinking of you.
That's sweet.
I really have to get back.
Can you move it along a little?
You told me you were washing these by hand.
- No wonder the elastic is sh*t. - I forgot.
And you forgot you left the vacuum on the terrace.
I was changing the bag.
And you forgot not to use S.O.S on the Teflon.
I mean, I leave for work every day
and I wonder what you're going to ruin in my house.
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Draper.
I don't know how to do this, but you're fired.
I'll get my things.
- I'm sorry. - No.
I am. I walked in on it and then I didn't want to pretend.
Are you okay, honey?
No.
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
I don't wanna go up until she's gone.
Let her alone with your silverware?
So, after weeks, I finally showed him the picture of my mother...
but that's not enough, because her name has been changed in the will.
That is quite a story line.
Well, you asked.
- It's meaty, isn't it? - It is.
I just wish watching TV during the day
didn't make me feel so guilty.
I had a miscarriage.
All right. I will watch.
No, in real life.
Two days ago.
I'm so sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you with this.
No, you obviously need to talk.
I was sloppy in Hawaii--
the time difference, vacation.
Now I feel so guilty.
May I?
What do you have to feel guilty about?
What did Don say?
I didn't tell him.
It's been a hard couple of weeks.
Oh.
I don't know why.
I mean, I do.
You were raised the same way I was.
I keep hearing Sister Eugenie in my head.
I'm such a horrible person.
You're not a horrible person.
No, I am.
I mean,
to be pregnant now
at this moment?
I didn't know what I wanted to do
and I was so relieved that I didn't have to do anything.
I see.
Has this ever happened to you?
About a year after I had Mitchell.
So I certainly understand some of what you're feeling.
But the rest of it,
no.
I'm sorry.
Really?
Because I was raised the same way,
so I would never even consider that my decision.
You really believe that?
I do.
And I think you do, too,
or you wouldn't feel this way.
I just feel so shitty.
I'm sorry I brought it up.
Hello.
Hello.
- Sylvia's here. - I see that.
Hello.
I should be going.
You don't have to rush off.
- Have a drink. - No, I'll leave you two alone.
- I fired the maid today. - Good riddance.
Good night, both of you.
See you tomorrow.
- Excuse me? - For dinner.
Oh, of course.
Yes.
So send her in.
Sorry to bother you, but this was on my desk.
Is it new?
There's usually a memo for everything around here.
- What is it? - It's Quest.
Feminine hygiene powder.
- Did I miss a meeting? - "Proof points--
has baking soda, makes you nicer if you're stinky,
k*ll overly critical bacteria."
"Target-- professional women and other Olsons."
Just give it to me.
Calm down.
I think this is somebody's idea of a joke.
Of course, when you want them to be funny they're useless.
Hello, gorgeous.
Hello, Herb.
Did you get all gussied up for me?
No.
I had no idea you'd be darkening my doorway.
When are you gonna come out to the lot?
I told you, I'll let you have a Jaguar for as long as you like.
I take the bus.
I know there's a part of you that's glad to see me.
And I know there's a part of you you haven't seen in years.
Herb! There you are.
How are you today?
Toodle-oo.
Mrs. Harris is here to see you.
He's here.
Thank you.
- Who are you? - I'm Bob Benson.
We've met before. I'm part of the team.
Doesn't the elevator go up to this floor?
Herb.
What brings you by?
I had some thoughts, the complexity of which
could not be expressed over a telephone.
What is it you want?
Well, you guys are gonna make some fancy-schmancy
Michelangelo TV spot and the dealers
are gonna foot most of the bill for running it.
That's how it works.
Well, I'm the only guy actually out there selling hamburgers
and I want people to know there's a hamburger store in Englewood,
not England or in your mind.
I don't want another thing with some shmuck sitting on his lawn mower
fantasizing that he's gonna win the Grand Prix driving a Jaguar.
I need foot traffic.
Get 'em in the door so I can move metal.
Well, you, along with the factory guys,
have already signed off on the work as well as the buy.
I just think there should be retail radio as well.
You know? "Does your car sound like this?"
Voom voom! "Does your wife sound like this?"
"Ooh, I love your car."
And then you say the phone number twice.
Wonderful.
We'd love to increase the exposure of the campaign.
How much more would you like to buy?
There's no increase. Just adjust the proportions.
I think we should spend 60% of the money
on local dealership ads instead of national.
Herb, that would really take a bite out of the national campaign.
Well, if you say so.
Unfortunately, it's not up to me,
so I am suggesting
that you recommend this plan to all of us.
Why don't you recommend it? It's your idea.
Because it's an idea you had yourself.
And Lord knows you're so damn persuasive.
We understand, Herb.
See how easy that was, Bob?
Bob, why don't you show me the sights?
You must be like a kid in a candy store around here.
- You can't shake his hand? - He didn't seem interested.
In fact, the only thing he seemed interested in was gutting our national campaign.
You do realize that defeats the purpose of having Jaguar?
So he's demanding and unreasonable.
How does that make him different from the other people who walk through that door?
I wish you would handle the clients as well as you're handling me.
Jimmy's Condom Warehouse
where the rubber meets the road. Jimmy speaking.
You want a drink?
No, thank you. I'm quite comfortable.
How was your day, honey?
Okay.
Okay? What happened to Shangri-La?
Chaough quit crapping out snow cones?
Everyone hates me here.
Well, that was bound to happen.
You worked for me and you like me.
- I worked with you. - I was tough but fair.
Oh, speaking of people who hate you,
Raymond J. Beans came in today and pulled a real boner.
Go on.
He brought in the head of ketchup.
He's obsessed with that man.
Yeah, he should be. I met him.
So Raymond makes the introduction
and then, according to Ken, ketchup leaves, but Raymond lingers
and he says he's gonna k*ll the account and himself
if they even talk to ketchup again.
Why'd he bring him in?
Because he's Raymond. He's a fraidycat.
And-- here's the part that's gonna make you happy--
Kenny spent two weeks telling everybody
how he was getting ketchup.
Okay, Tuesday morning is perfect.
What? Oh, yep.
We'll have your wig ready then, ma'am.
You're allowed to make personal calls after 5:00,
especially if they make you laugh.
My friend Stan was telling me a funny story
- about one of our old clients. - What happened?
Oh, it's complicated, but basically the guy from Heinz Baked Beans
hates the guy at Heinz Ketchup.
Of course he does.
Well, surprisingly, beans brought ketchup in
for a meeting at the agency and everyone got excited,
and then unsurprisingly he sent ketchup out of the room
and told everyone it was just for show.
So he's unhappy?
He's not going anywhere.
Probably misses you.
No.
I assure you, he doesn't.
There's nothing like things going badly when you leave, is there?
Sorry I'm late.
3rd Avenue was a parking lot.
I'm not feeling well.
That's not where it hurts.
Oh. Did you cancel?
No, I thought I'd feel better by the time you got home.
We're supposed to be there in 15 minutes.
They're probably already there.
I know, but I don't want to pretend
like I'm having a good time and it's too late to cancel.
- They'll survive. - I want you to go.
I want you to have fun.
Okay.
But you go right to bed.
Yes, sir.
Go away!
Somebody help me!
What on earth is that?
Somebody, please!
Somebody help!
- Oh, my goodness! - What happened to you?
Hey, Campbell, she's your problem now.
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.
- He was chasing me. - Close the door.
Hold this to your nose.
What the hell happened?
I'm so embarrassed.
We had a terrible fight.
- I'm going to call the authorities. - No, please.
Well, then I'm taking you to the hospital.
- I'll be fine. - No, what do you think you're doing?
You're not going back there. Peter, go to Tammy's bathroom.
There's some cotton wool.
I'll be right back.
I hope you haven't been waiting long.
Oh, don't worry about it. I was late, too.
They already gave us a hard time.
- Where's your wife? - She sends her regrets. She wasn't feeling well.
- That's too bad. - You look lovely.
Let's get you a drink.
We'll get the waiter to do the whole show again.
I'm afraid there's only going to be three of us.
- Don? - Old-fashioned, please.
Subito.
Well, the North Koreans really took that ship.
And the Vietcong, did you see them storming the embassy?
I haven't followed it today.
- We got it back. - Still...
these two little pissant countries handing our head to us.
Well, I don't know about the ship,
but from what I've read, the embassy was an ambush that broke the cease-fire.
We gave them peace for their sacred holiday.
Next thing we know, they cut us to ribbons.
Reminds me of Cuba.
No one took Fidel Castro seriously.
We thought he was Señor Wences.
Turns out he was George Washington.
And they say surgeons are arrogant.
Who says that?
You know we're losing the w*r.
Wouldn't know it from looking around here.
Yeah, it's something, right?
- You are Dr. Rosen? - You see this service?
Yes. We'd like to hear the spiel again.
Uh, scusi. There is a telephone call.
Really?
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna take this as an opportunity to powder my nose.
There's no answer.
Is there anyone else? Family?
My sister's back in Oneonta.
My mother's in Boca Raton.
Well, you can't go home. We should find a hotel.


Let's try some ice.
What did you say to him?
Hello? Yes.
Do you have any vacancies this evening?
Take me to the city. I want to be with you.
Absolutely not.
Very good. Thank you.
The Old Greenwich has rooms.
- Can you take me there? - We'll get you a taxi.
Nonsense. I'll drive you.
I don't know what I was thinking. I'll run you over.
Brenda, dear, let's go. It's best this way.
Emergency averted?
Unfortunately, no.
Sylvia and you are having dinner.
- This is silly. - We can do this another time.
I'm not taking my foot out of the door of this restaurant.
Order for four or they'll punish me.
Good luck.
What are you having?
I don't know that I'm that hungry.
You want another glass of wine? Should we get a bottle?
You're drinking something else.
I don't want you to have wine if you don't drink wine.
I'm not gonna drink a whole bottle, obviously.
I don't know how obvious that is.
Another glass is fine.
So what looks good here?
Depends what you want.
Well, I'm hungry, I'm in a good mood,
and I'd like some guidance on the Italian menu from my favorite Italian.
I didn't cook it, so I can't speak to its quality.
You think I'd like eggplant rollatinis?
For the lovely signora?
- We're not ready yet. - Yes, we are.
Can she have another glass of wine
and could you give us a minute?
Certo.
What's wrong?
How could I possibly know what you like to eat?
I thought you were looking forward to this.
I don't know what we're doing.
We're having dinner together.
And I'm sorry, but I guess it was a stupid idea to think
we could spend time together outside of your maid's room.
Just because they cleared their place settings
doesn't mean we're alone.
Is that what's bothering you?
That everything worked out perfectly?
And you enjoy how foolish they both look.
Now I understand.
You want to feel shitty
right up until the point where I take your dress off.
Because I'm going to do that.
You want to skip dinner? Fine. But don't pretend.
"Casta Diva - Norma 1st Act" playing
And what if she had come?
The evening would be just the same,
only it would be someone else's dress?
What are you talking about?
Weren't you the one who told me you were drifting apart?
Isn't that what this was about?
I want you.
I want you all the time.
But if you've suddenly decided you want something more than that,
well, then, that's news, isn't it?
So, have you decided?
I don't know. Have you?
He'll have the steak diavolo
and I'll have the branzino.
Anything to start?
No. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I have no right to be jealous.
This is just us here tonight.
We have to be careful. We can't fall in love.
It won't be so French anymore.
Hi, this is Johnny Carson. As you know,
this is the usual starting time for "The Tonight Show."
And tonight my guest is the New Orleans district attorney Mr. Jim Garrison,
who is with us to discuss, as he puts it,
some new and vital information concerning the Kennedy assassination.
But because of the critical w*r situation in Vietnam,
especially around Saigon, NBC for the next 15 minutes
is going to bring you a special news program via satellite.
So stay with us. We'll return in 15 minutes
with our guest Mr. Garrison.
Did you have fun?
Arnold had an emergency,
so Sylvia and I had to eat enough
to keep him in good graces there.
Are you feeling better?
I need to talk to you.
What's wrong?
Um...
Well, I had a miscarriage
a few days ago.
Are you okay?
Did you go to the doctor?
Yes.
How far along were you?
Six weeks.
I wish you would have told me.
I guess I didn't know how you'd feel.
I didn't know what you'd want.
Megan, you have to know I'd want what you want.
Is that what you want?
Of course it is.
But I don't know that it's even
the right time to have a conversation about it.
And I guess that's why I didn't tell you.
But I should have.
Yes, you should have.
Do you want to have that conversation?
Whatever you want.
Now I can go to sleep.
Good morning.
- Where's Tammy? - Leticia took her to the park.
Oh.
Well, I'm off.
Couldn't you just pretend?
I let you have that apartment.
Somehow I thought that there was some dignity
in granting permission.
All I wanted was for you to be discreet.
She lives on our block!
Trudy, don't jump to conclusions.
There's no way for me to escape.
To not be an object of pity
while you get to do whatever you feel like.
I have never said no to you.
That is not true. What are we doing out here?
We're done, Peter. This is over.
You want a divorce?
I refuse to be a failure.
I don't care what you want anymore.
This is how it's going to work.
You will be here only when I tell you to be here.
I'm drawing a 50-mile radius around this house
and if you so much as open your fly to urinate, I will destroy you.
Do you understand?
You know what?
You're going to go to bed alone tonight
and you're going to realize you don't know anything for sure.
I'll live with that.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
So far this is all we have,
but I want you to find out everything you can on Heinz Ketchup.
What?
And this is not a joke.
No. I can't do that.
Why not?
It's a little bit of a secret,
but it turns out they're taking meetings.
I told you that secret and I shouldn't have.
Look, everybody's gonna know. We just know a little sooner.
My friend told me that in confidence.
He's not your friend.
- He's the enemy. - Well, he doesn't know that.
Maybe you need a friend more than you need a job.
I didn't know that. I'm in advertising.
It's not that.
It's just that it was a private conversation.
What are you, his priest? This is how wars are won.
Your friend's mistake was underestimating you.
I hope ketchup makes the same mistake so you can blow their mind.
So, correct me if I'm wrong, Pete.
I certainly will.
You're suggesting that we forego
this sparkling national ad campaign
in favor of hard-driving sales ads at the local dealer level?
Not exactly. We will still have a national presence
with the sophisticated work that Don presented and you loved,
but we will increase sales with a surgical
and financial focus on local media.
Well, that sounds good to me. Of course, I'm a little bit biased.
Why would we do that?
We feel it's best to have a plan that creates customers,
not just aficionados.
Don, are you really in favor
of throwing our emphasis into radio?
Well, it's hard to argue
with a more direct appeal to customers.
I mean, we can artsy up the image of Jaguar,
make it look romantic and stylish,
but isn't it better to tell people
who are actually in the market for a car
that a Jaguar is available?
I think it's an exciting new angle
to use direct sales on a luxury vehicle.
I mean, forget about radio.
How about a mailer
or a circular in the Sunday paper?
I don't know if that's what we had in mind.
So this is your recommendation?
I think it's better to
think about someone in New Jersey
driving in their current car
and hearing that right around the corner
there's a Jaguar to buy at a low, low price.
I bet the numbers would support that don't they, Harry?
That...
is really a statistics game.
You know what? I will have to double-check.
Look, why are you limiting yourself?
Wouldn't you rather cast a wide net
so you can sell Jaguar to the average guy?
You know, truck drivers, housewives.
I was under the impression from the work you showed us
that this would be a more elegant approach
that made the Jaguar seem rare because, let's face it,
the gentleman who buys our car needs to be of some means.
I am 100% positive
that this approach moves cars.
And not just Jaguars. This is proven to move all kinds of cars.
Hell, even used cars. Am I wrong, Herb?
No, he's right. It moves cars.
Gentlemen, we appreciate the recommendation,
but we believe we should stay with the proposal
as first discussed.
And as persuasive as these arguments were,
that is how we will continue to proceed.
Let's not be too hasty. Maybe we should listen to them.
At least give it some thought.
Herb's right.
We still believe this is our best chance for success.
Fellas, this is gonna work.
I'm sorry, but this is our final decision.
Thank you very much.
What the hell was that?
Herb, we couldn't have pushed any harder.
You pushed, then you let Don talk.
You should know better. The guy's not a salesman.
That was the deftest self-immolation I've ever seen.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't know you were capable of being that bad.
- What was that in there? - I wasn't feeling well.
Something about that guy makes me sick.
Don't be cute. I still have his spit in my hair.
Why can't you just follow the rules?
I did. I did exactly what he asked for.
Not in spirit. You know damn well that is not what he wanted.
Why do we care what that guy wants?
- Because he's a client. - Our client.
And so we just keep saying yes no matter what
because we didn't say no to begin with?
You know what this is? It's Munich.
You guys are always talking about Munich.
What the hell does that mean anyway?
It means we gave the Germans whatever they wanted
to make them happy, but it just made them want more.
Well, who the hell won the w*r?
As my mother used to say,
your options were dishonor or w*r.
You chose dishonor, you might still get w*r.
That was Churchill.
First one in, last one out.
I don't know how you do it.
Me either.
Well, it can't be that bad when you're doing something that you love.
I'm glad it looks like that to you.
I spent a year in finance
watching identical men in identical suits
sneak drinks out of a desk drawer
while counting other people's money.
What house?
My family's been at Brown Brothers Harriman
for three generations.
You make this look a lot better.
It's all about what it looks like, isn't it?
I'm going down to the deli.
Can I get you something?
No, thank you.
Bob.
My wife asked me and I seem to have forgotten.
Could you pick me up some toilet paper?
I got it, chief.
Good evening.
He's home. You can't knock on the door like that.
I was taking the trash out and you left it open.
Tomorrow morning.

You're a dirty little spy.
I dropped a penny.
You got your own room.
