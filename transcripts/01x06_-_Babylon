Dick Whitman, you watch where youre going.
Youre going to break your neck.
You going to cry or get up?
Im getting up, Uncle Mack.
Good. Theres someonewho wants to meet you.
What are you afraid of?
There was lots of screaming.
Always is.
The Lord has given us a blessing.
You have a new brother.
He aint my brother.
Of course he is.You got the same daddy.
Isnt he beautiful?
I named him Adam after the first man.
Daddy!
Don, are you all right?
Happy Mothers Day.
This is fascinating.
Its better than the Hollywood version.
Its certainly dirtier.
Well, Joan Crawford is not what she was.
You know, honestly,
I found her eyebrows completely unnerving,
like a couple of...
caterpillars just pasted there.
Her standing next to Suzy Parkeras if they were the same species.
Well, some men like eyebrows,
and all men like Joan Crawford.
Salvatore couldnt stop talking about her.
To think, one of the great beauties,and there she is, so old.
Id just like to disappear at that point.
It makes perfect sense.
I promise you, Bets,
the first sign of crows feet,and Ill put you on an ice floe.
Or would you prefer to bemy gal in the iron mask?
Did you have a nice Mothers Day?
It was lovely.
My mother was at least two years olderthan whatever Joan Crawford says she is,
and she was still very fetching.
Id like to think thatshed stand up very well
as a prediction of myeventual appearance.
Bets, dont.
No melancholy.
Im allowed to be sentimentalon Mothers Day.
But its your Mothers Day, not hers.
Im just saying that my motherlooked handsome.
Actually, vivaciousand positively cheerful,
right up to her end.
Its good remembrance.
Dr. Wayne suggested a book which...
says that its partof the mourning process.
Dr. Wayne.
I do think its helping.
So youre cured?
I dont know how they tell that.
When their vacation house is paid for.
Dont deride him.
Mourning is just extended self-pity.
In New Guinea,
pygmies grind up their ancestorsand drink the powder in a beer.
And a model culture at that, pygmies.
Did you know Michelangelowas painting the Sistine ceiling
when those people were stillliving in caves discovering fire?
I didnt know that.
Well, its true.
Introduction to Basic Anthropology.
What about...
Advanced Reproduction?
How are your studiesprogressing in that?
Completed.
I got an A, actually.
You did?
Yep, I did.
I flunked the whole thing.
Well, thats becauseyou got caught cheating.
Get the light.
I want you so much.
I thought about it all day.
Me, too.
No, I mean it.
Its all I think about...
every day.
Your car coming down the driveway.
I put the kids to bed early.
I make a grocery list.I cook butterscotch pudding.
I never let my hands idle.
Brushing my hair,
drinking my milk...
and its all in a kind of fog
because I cant stopthinking about this.
I want you so badly.
You have me.
You do.
Ah, Don.
You remember Nick Rodisfrom Olympic Cruise Lines.
Nick, did you ever addthat second deck of portholes?
Yes, but those rooms get pretty wet.
This is Urine Ben Shulhaifrom The Israel Ministry of Tourism.
It is pronounced "Yoram. "
Of course.
And this young lady is Lily Meyer.
Pleasure to meet you.
And you.
Caviar, blinis, mai tais.
Were thinking of a land of exotic luxury.
Wed like to think that if Beirutis the Paris of the Middle East,
Haifa can be the Rome.
Its an exciting idea.
Of course we should keep in mind
that Paris has the Eiffel Towerand Rome has the Coliseum.
And Tel Avenue is about to have a Hilton.
Olympic is chartingour most luxurious liner
all along the wondrous portsof the Israeli Riviera.
We are going to visitMr. Bernbach down the street,
but some of usfind his humor to be kitsch.
We thought we would trya traditional way as well.
Sterling Cooper doesntlike to think of itself as traditional.
Maybe that is the wrong word.My English is not so good.
Glamour, like glamorous... thats the word.
We saw your awards.
We were impressedwith your work on Rio de Janeiro.
Youre not thinking of putting
a 150-foot statue of Jesusin Tel Aviv, are you?
Because thats how we sold Rio.
This book has beenon the best-seller list
for two years in the States,
and is soon to be a major motion picturestarring Paul Newman.
America has a love affair with Israel,
and we would like to bringthe two parties together.
Well, you certainlysaved me some legwork.
All I have is the Bible.
Lets stay away from that.
So, your ideal tourist.
Whats his yearly salary?
Whatever you make.
They always say that.
Well, look whos here:A couple of angels.
Do we have lunch today?
No, darling, were goingto get Margaret a haircut.
A haircut?
Oh, I like your ponytail, squirt.
It makes you look young.
I like your hair, Daddy.It makes you look old.
We just have to find the right place.
Ginger?
I cut my own hair.
You picked her.
Dont you two make a handsome couple.
Honestly, I dont go for handsome.
Mona, Margaret.
What brings you below 59th Street?
Margaret, say hello.
Hello, Mr. Draper.
Oh, Mona, arent you lucky?
Mother and daughter on the town.
Where are the girlsgetting their hair done these days?
By girls, you mean Brigitte Bardot?
Because thats what Im seeing.
As long as she can pina hat on it for church.
You are going to love this man.
I will make you an appointment. Come on.
Bye, Don.
Roger, sweetheart.
She used to love being in my office.
Her haircut is the leastof Margarets problems.
Shes dated what, two boys?
One of them joined the service,the other one committed su1c1de.
She doesnt want to go to college.
Doesnt want to work.
Not interested in charity.
I dont know what we did wrong.
We gave her everything she wanted,and shes still useless.
Youre being too hard on her.
Shes a young girl.
When I was her age,I rode a tramp steamer
from Bar Harbor to Hilton Head.
I bet it was a yacht.
Someone still has to sail those things.
I think Margaret reminds you of you.
Youre both spoiled.
Zip.
Come back to bed.
We can stay here all afternoon.
You dont have to go back to work.
I do. Zip.
You like the pearl necklace I gave you?
Its gorgeous.
Arent you even going to have any of this?
Look, weve got Oysters Rockefeller,Beef Wellington, Napoleons.
If we leave this lunch alone,itll take over Europe.
I dont like eating in here.
Food that close to the bedreminds me of a hospital.
If you had your own apartment,we could go to your place.
You could cook for me.
Dont you like things the way they are?
Are you kidding?
This has been the best year of my life.
Do you have any idea
how unhappy I was before I met you?
I was thinking of leaving my wife.
Im just getting tired of all the...sneaking around.
Arent you?
Roger, I know as much about menas you know about advertising,
and I know that the sneaking aroundis your favorite part.
You know, I have a lot of favorite parts.
Id like to get you...
a little fourth floor walk-up somewhere
with no doors, no windows,
and lock you up for a week.
Thats tempting.
But I like hotels.
You leave with what you came in with.
And little soaps. I love those.
I wish I knew what you wanted, Joanie.
I love this, Roger,
but a week is a considerable length of time,and I have my own world.
I go out, and I have parties,and I have friends over...
Male friends?
Yes.
I dont want to hear this.
Carol and I have this nice little rotation.
Carol. The disaster.
Ive known Carol since college,
and shes been a good friend,
and shes bright, and shes neat.
So you think youd be lonely.
I think it would behalf as much fun alone.
You could get a bird.
Theyre fairly neat for animals.
Roger, if you had your way,
I would be strandedin some paperweight
with my legs stuck in the air.
Wait, wait, wait.
Youre just gonna paintthat picture and go, huh?
Cant we... just enjoy this?
I mean, we both know Ill eventually finda more permanent situation,
and youll find a new model.
The 61s are coming out soon.
I hear the fins are bigger next year.
Whatever you want, Red.
I see why they want the g*n.
Its tough to compete
with Bermuda only three hours away.
It helps if they stop blowing up hotels.
Oh, k*ll me, you busty Jewess.
Maybe we should try and exploitthe danger instead of fighting it.
Travel as adventure.
Or how about this?
Average American family of threestanding on shore, suitcases in hand.
The Red Sea parts before them.
On the other sidewaits a gleaming four-star resort.
Shouldnt you see the Promised Land?
Take religion out.
Theyve got plenty ofStations of the Cross traffic.
Ive skimmed this research,and the whole things pretty red.
These communes, kibbutzes.
Its positively Soviet.
Except the Daughtersof the American Revolution
are shuttling this bookup and down Fifth Avenue.
Its a good story.
They start in these prison camps.
Like, real prisoners.
Then the next thing you know,theyre in the desert, armed to the teeth,
cutting their way through the enemy,dying for the cause.
And then they have a government.
A commie government.
Made my mother cry.
So, we have a quasi-communist statewhere women have g*n,
and its filled with Jews.
Well, not completely filled.
Lets not forget that there are also Arabs.
Theyve got oranges.
As far as I can see,
the biggest thingthis place has going for it:
The people are good-looking.
The Jews there dontlook like the Jews here.
Have you been to the Diamond District?
All right. I have to makea couple phone calls.
Lets pick this up later.
Peggy, will you get mea private line, please?
Right away, Mr. Draper.
Donald Draper, Line 2.
I debated not taking the call.
Im glad you did. I need to see you.
I dont think thats a good idea.
Its business.
Meet me for a drink.
Im busy this evening.
I wouldnt have calledif it wasnt important.
I should still be able to talk to you.
Give me credit for that.
Lunch. Tomorrow.
Lunch.
The Tea Room at The Pierre, 12:15.
Message received.
Oh, its so muggy tonight.
Did you just get a library card?
I rarely see you read anything
that doesnt have a manila folderwrapped around it.
You should clean the gutters.
This weekend.
Is that good?
Theres less action than I thought.
I thought it was a romance.
You know, the first boyI ever kissed was Jewish.
How did that happen?
My friend Deirdre Shawwas friends with a Jewish girl,
Beth... Gold, Silver, or something.
Beth invited us to a mixerat her synagogue in Lower Merion.
Im surprised your mother let you go.
Well, it was a fundraiser for charity.
Those poor skinny people in the boats.
This boy danced with me all evening.
David Rosenberg.
He was very good-looking,
but there was somethingabout him that was gloomy.
Was he a good kisser?
Lets just say he hadmore practice than I did.
Yeah, Im sure he was very disappointed.
Oh, please. The onlyreason he picked me
is because I wasntpart of the synagogue.
In fact, the next day, on the school bus,
Beth told everyone I was neckingwith David Rosenberg.
The looks they gave me.
They were all blondes by the next summer.
Honey, its hot.
And I have to read this book about the desert.
Of course.
Go ahead.
We should getan air conditioner up here.
Well see.
Hiya, fellas. Come on in.
Did you see this?
Someone broke intothe Yankees equipment locker
in Cleveland yesterday.
Swiped Mickey Mantles pet glove.
Huh. They should have taken his bat.
Shall we wait for youto have your breakfast?
A day without orange juiceis a hell of a long day.
Hey, look, Ma, no hands.
"Belle Jolie"?
Yeah, Ive been looking at the workof our esteemed predecessors.
Im not heartened.
They make more colors of lipstick
than Howard Johnsonhas ice cream flavors,
but their sales are in the crapper.
These names.
Passion Flower Peach,
Tropical Boudoir Red.
And look, Ethel Rosenberg Pink.
Wear it to the chair.
Did you know that lipstick was invented
to simulate the flush on a womans faceafter you treated her right?
If youre going to quotethe research report,
dont start with "Did you know?"
Research, Im stumped.
Ill be honest. I dont speak Moron.
Do either of you speak Moron?
Lets throw it to the chickens.
Okay, girls, come on in.
Come on in, ladies. Gather around.
Settle down.
What, no lunch?
No, dear. This is better.
Belle Jolie wants us to tell them
what we think about theirnew line of lipsticks.
One-way glass.
That name seem weird to you?
Should be two-way glass, right?
I dont care what they call it.
b*at the hell out of X-ray Specs.
Its called brainstorming.
That sounds intimidating.
Is it like a test?
There are no wrong answers.
You just be your pretty little selves.
Grab a lipstick,grab a mirror, and sit down.
Oh, this ones too red for me.
And remember, the mirrorcould be your best friend
or your worst enemy.
Has no taste.
Ugly dress.
Horrible wig.
Theyre brainstorming.
I wouldnt expect morethan a few sprinkles.
I love it when they do that.
My little blowfish.
Anybody mind if I take off my pants?
The red ones for me.
How many lipsticks do you own?
Gee, I dont know.
Id have to go home and count.
Do you match your lip colorto your clothing or to your accessories?
I know. That seemslike a loaded question.
It is unloaded,
and I insist you curbyour editorial comments.
Sometimes I match it to my nail polish.
Good answer. Go ahead.
Do you change your lip colorwith the seasons?
You, stand over there.
At what point do we start running electricitythrough the chairs?
You should have put a man in thereso theyd take it seriously.
Good.
I was afraid Id missed it.
I want to stand and salute that.
Whats with Mouse Ears over there?
Thanks for coming.
Can I get you anything?
No.
Howve you been?
Fine.
Tired.
It doesnt show.
Im in the middle of spring inventory.
I hope youre not going to tell me
that the grand planfor remaking our store has a hitch in it.
You look beautiful.
I thought you hadurgent business to discuss.
Anything for the lady?
Nothing for me... Mmm, coffee.
Irish coffee?
Coffee.
Yes, sir.
Business?
It turns out Israel Tourismis considering becoming a client,
and Im having a hard timegetting a handle on it.
And Im the only Jewyou know in New York City?
Youre my favorite.
Jesus, Don, crack a book once in a while.
I have.
Its all sentimental World w*r II trivia,
oranges, kids in blue and white hats.
Theyre doing a movie of Exoduswith Paul Newman.
Paul Newman? Thats nice.
Now I have two reasons to see it.
Damn it.
Youre usually so put together.
Thank you.
Ill say one thing about Israelis.
Dont cross them.
Well, those people at the meetingwere definitely Zionists.
Zion just means Israel.
Its a very old name.
Im sorry. Im not an expert on this,
and something feels strangeabout being treated like one.
I just want to know something about it
that doesnt come fromsome ministry of propaganda.
Well, heres some moreWorld w*r II trivia.
They just arrested Adolf Eichmannin Argentina last week.
Have you seen his resume?
Okay, I deserved that.
But Im talking abouttourists going to Israel.
I dont know what I can say.
Im American.Im really not very Jewish.
If my mother hadnt died having me,
I could have been Marilyninstead of Rachel.
No one would know the difference.
What is the difference?
Look, Jews have livedin exile for a long time:
First in Babylon,
then all over the world... Shanghai, Brooklyn...
and weve managed to make a go of it.
Maybe it has something to do
with the fact that wethrive at doing business
with people who hate us.
I dont hate you.
No. Individuals are wonderful.
Thats not what I meant.
I dont know.
A country...
for "those people," as you call us,
well...
it seems very important.
Then why arent you there?
My life is here.
My grandfather came from Russia,
now we have a store on Fifth Avenue.
Ill visit, but I dont have to live there.
It just... has to be.
For me, its moreof an idea than a place.
Utopia.
Maybe.
They taught us at Barnard about that word.
Utopia.
The Greeks had two meanings for it:
"Eu-topos,"
meaning "the good place,"
and "ou-topos,"
meaning "the place that cannot be. "
I have to get back to the office.
I better not see this on my bill.
Okay, girls, playtimes over.
Time to put down your lipsticksand head back to your desks.
Thank you for your cooperationand your lips.
These go in the closet.
Well, now we have to countthe shades they tried.
Can you bring me those tissues, dear?
Heres your basket of kisses.
Basket of kisses.
Thats cute.
Who told you that?
What do you mean?
Where did you hear that?
I just thought of it.
Isnt that what it is?
It is, sweetheart.
Which color did you like?
I didnt get the one I liked.
Someone took my color.
Why didnt you choose another one?
Im very particular.
As opposed to the other girls?
I dont know.


I dont think anyone wants to beone of a hundred colors in a box.
I think thats enough complaining.
Why dont you headback to your desk, Peggy?
Bet you wish you could pourthat in a glass and drink it.
Peggy, clear the rest of my afternoon,would you, please?
You have the SnidersCatsup people at 3:00.
Have a box of cigars sent over to Jim Kingwith my apologies.
Ill find out what he smokes.
Good girl.
You got a minute, Chief?
Just.
You dont mind, do you?
Use a glass, Freddie.
Your girl is full of surprises.
Oh, pretty Peggy Sue.
Peggy?
If you say so.
I try to avoid eye contact
to avoid being blindedby the earnestness.
Actually, she really stood out,brainstorming-wise.
Brainstorming?
Sorry I missed that.
What was the line?
A bucket of kisses.
Basket of kisses.
Bucket sounds better.
If you like em wet and sloppy.
The point is,
while the rest of the hens were busypulling out each others feathers,
that one saw the benefit, not the feature.
Really?
Yeah. She said she didnt want to be oneof a hundred colors in a box.
Thats interesting, isnt it?
It is.
It was like watching a dog play the piano.
Its me, Barbara. Can you talk?
Shes still sleeping, thank God.
Whats on your mind?
I think I might have met somebody.
Youre not sure? Thats good.
He has some serious limitations.
Does he work in the store?
No, he doesnt work at the store.
He has a job, doesnt he?
Yes.
Then whats the problem?
Would Daddy like him?
Daddy would hate him.
So hes not Jewish.
Who cares what Daddy thinks?
Hes not your boyfriend anymore.
Barbara.
Youre 28 years old.
You work 60 hours a week.
The last thing you wantis to end up like Aunt Rosie,
lying to your nieces abouthow many engagements you had.
Aunt Rosie wasnt lying.
Oh, please, there wasno Max the Communist.
Does he have all his hair?
More than hell ever need.
Is he funny?
Sometimes. After a couple.
So hes a shikker. Daddy will hate him.
I do feel this attraction.
I want him,
and I want to ignoreeverything else about him.
Its 1960. We dont live in a shtetl.
We can marry for love.
Im not sure people do that anymore.
Why do you always have to be so cynical?
Because sometimes...things come...
good things...
but theres no future in them.
Youre a modern woman, Rach.
Forget the wedding.
Believe me, Id do anythingfor some romance right now.
Peggy.
Hi, Joan.
Mr. Rumsen would like youto put your industrious little mind
towards coming up with copyfor Belle Jolie Lipsticks.
I dont understand.
They want me to write something?
Whatever you saidin that brainstorming session
apparently knocked their socks off.
Oh, my gosh.
I dont know what to say.
You will, of course,continue to cover Mr. Drapers desk.
Any writing you dowill be on your own time.
Do I get a raise?
No.
Congratulations.
More work and more responsibility.
I guess youll be entitledto some dinner money.
Thats swell.
Maybe I should go and thank them?
Im not really dressed.Tomorrow, maybe?
No need.They wanted me to tell you.
They were very specific about it.
Well, you know what they say:The medium is the message.
And here I was just wishing for a manto help me with my yard work.
Sorry.
Thats what I get for being domestic.
Lets get this off.
Oh, God, hold that.
The thought.
Hi, Roy.
Hi, beautiful.
Whats shakin?
Busy dance card, huh?
Uh, Roy, this is my friend Don Draper.
Don, this is Roy Hazellit.
Pleasure.
Lans playing down at the Gaslight.
Were gonna go support him,pass the basket.
You in?
That is if Dad will let you out.
Sounds like fun.
Don, we should go down for a while.
Come on. Itll be a kick.What do you say?
Afraid youll miss the 5:31?
I think Im gonna stay here.
Ill wear a skirt and nothing else.
What took you so long?
One of the media buyersambushed me in the elevator
with tickets to the ballet, of all things.
I told him I had plans,
but he insisted we sharea cab across town anyways.
I couldnt shake him.
Which one was it?
George Asbury. Hes a hound.
It doesnt matter.Theyre all just boys.
Poor bastard probablycouldnt help himself,
the way you glide around that officelike some magnificent ship.
Well, I dont want to be a distraction.
Shall I, um, order horse blindersfor the rest of the office?
You didnt.
Oh, I sure did.
Well, what am I supposed to do with it?
The store lady said you can do anythingbut put the cage on the radiator.
Youre terrible.
Well, you cant blame a man for trying.
I just hate the thoughtof having to share you.
You dont have to share me now.
Joanie, you smell so good.
Ive been thinking about this all day.
Mona is looking at a weekendin Old Saybrook with the in-laws.
Theres not enough liquor in the world.
Roger.
Sorry.
"Mary Katharine Cahill,
"a daughter of Harriet M. Barr
"and Archibald W. Barrof Stonington, Connecticut,
"and Kevin Mark Duncan III,
"a son of b*at Hoslinger
"and Kevin Mark Duncan, Jr.,of Manhattan,
"were married last evening
at the Episcopal Churchof the Heavenly Rest. "
He travels around the country
and collects miniaturereplicas of monuments...
Washington Memorial,Bunker Hill, Mount Rushmore...
and then he sticks them up his ass.
Symbolism intended.
No place to put your coat.
Switch seats with me.
No way.
Can we get a round over here?
Jack Daniels, Duchess.
Sounds like a great idea.
Anyway, turns out this Spanish cat and I
are mucho simpaticowith the direction we talked about going.
With the "Theater of the People" thing?
Conscious drama.
Not the soulless bullshit
kept alive by the middle class
with their season ticketsto Dick Van d*ke and Mary Martin.
I bet Don here can tell you firsthand.
Broadway is the birthplaceof mediocrity.
"The groom wore a matching boutonniêreof sweetheart roses. "
Well, maybe its born there,
but I think it may be conceived right here.
"The couple willhoneymoon in Jamaica,
and take up residence in Rye, New York. "
Thank you, Don.
Lchaim.
So what do you do, Don?
I blow up bridges.
Dons in advertising.
No way.
Madison Avenue? What a gas.
We all have to serve somebody.
Perpetuating the lie.
How do you sleep at night?
On a bed made of money.
Isnt this an education?
You hucksters in your tower createdthe religion of mass consumption.
People want to be told what to do so badlythat theyll listen to anyone.
When you say people,
I have a feeling youretalking about thou.
And I have a feeling
that you spent more timeon your hair this morning than she did.
You two want to headto the urinals and poke it out?
So, Roy,
if you had a job...
what would you do?
Im starting a theater,right here in the Village.
Its a cooperative.
Midge is going to get in there,paint some flats.
I said Id think about it.
Last night I dreamed
of making love to Fidel Castroin a king-size bed
at the Waldorf-Astoria.
"¡Viva la revoluciónl" he roared,
as he vanquished my dress.
Outside the window,
Nikita Khrushchev watched us,
plucking a chicken.
Take off your shirt!
Take your shirt off!
I should go.
Too much art for me.
Stay.
This is Ian.
Well go right afterwards.
