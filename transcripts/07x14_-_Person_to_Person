What are you afraid of?
- That was fast.- Apparently not.
So, what do you think?Can we go to El Mirage?
You and your record books.
You gotta take care of that shimmy.
You wont lose control, but I betit creates drag.
You know an awful lot about carsfor a guy who hasnt got one.
We just need a stake.
A couple hundred bucks fora flatbed rig, some parts.

Oh.
That said, our secret plan herehas been discovered.
They know I dont need two secretaries.Im sorry.

Hes not dead. Stop saying that.
There are a lot of better places than here.

(EVERYONE MURMERING)
Why did they take us off Chevalier?
Did Ted say anything to you about it?
Teds not the creative director.They moved it to Davids group.
Does David know they took us off?
(SIGHS) Theres plenty to go around.
Its done. You have four good accounts.Get to work.
Lorraine, do you have a moment?
Not really.
Why are we off Chevalier?
Because Stu Riley took overfrom Pete Campbell
and he has his favorites.
I thought David wanted us on it.
I guess he didnt.
Well, does he know?
I dont know.
Why dont I call Davidand let him know youre unhappy?
You know what, Lorraine?
Call David.
In fact, why dont we go overand see him right now?
Im sure hed love to get involved.
Fine. You want it, you can have it.
Thanks so much.
(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
- You hung up my jeans.- Mmm.
I like having a man to take care of.
My wallet didnt happento fall out, did it?
What the hell does that mean?
Should I go look?
Maybe I wanted to know who you were.
Everybody thinks youre from Detroit,
come to steal their secrets.
Did you leave me anything?
Youve never paid for it, huh?
I have and I will. I justlike it to be voluntary.
Get your purse.
(SIGHS)
Could have asked me.
Thats never worked.
Whose ring is that?
(CHUCKLES)
Werent you gonna steal it?
(TITTE RS)

(SNIFFS) Mmm.
Okay, my turn.
(SNIFFS)
(SNIFFS)
(COUGHS)
Oh!
Thats fast.
I feel like someone just gave mesome very good news.
You know, we could livelike this all the time.
You just enjoy corrupting me.
Not the cocaine.
Im talking abouttaking advantage of all I have.
All you have.
You should be spoiled.
I couldnt be more spoiled.
The way Ive been living in New York,
its hard to tell whenthe vacation started.
Kevins going to school soon,so I know you have to be in one place,
but, if you think about it,why does that place have to be New York?
There are good schools everywhereand you hate your mother.
I dont hate her.
Is that all you heard?
Youre cheating yourself.That tiny apartment.
I dont wanna make plans,but we could get a place in the mountains
or the country. Or a place inthe mountains and the country.
Have you been looking for a place?
Its a hobby.
I mean I guess what Im trying to say is
I want you to let yourselfhave a future with me.
Do you wanna get married?
Sure. If you do.
But it seems to me, your lifeis undeveloped property.
You can turn it into anything you want.Its got a hell of a view.
Do we have to get married?
Hell, no.
I want you so much right now.
(JOAN GIGGLES)
Im sorry. I got held up.
No, Im sorry.
Samsonite is sh**ting tomorrowand they changed everything.
I feel horrible, but Im afraid its justyou and Harry for lunch.

Someone important?
Doesnt anything mean anything to you?

He acts like were the Three Musketeers.
Weve never had lunch.
I just wanted to saythat Im very happy for you.
And everyones going to miss you,
who doesnt hate you forgetting that big job.
Well, youre doing fine.
Keep it up, youll bea creative director by 1980.
God, that sounds like a long time.
Im telling you, it will happen.
They just have to get used to the idea.
Someday, people are gonna bragthat they worked with you.
What am I supposed to say to that?
I dont know. No ones ever said it to me.
A thing like that.
Ill be back.
That thing better be alive.
So, youre in Utah?
I sent you a clipping.
They broke the land speed recordright up in Bonneville.

She doesnt want you to know,but I just thought...
No, you did the right thing.Im coming home.
No, Im telling you because she wantsGene and Bobby to live with Uncle William.
Dont worry, youre all goingto live with me. I promise.
Let me finish.Ive thought about this more than you have.
You have to tell her that
you think its best thatthey stay with Henry.
No.
Daddy, its going to beso hard for them already.
They should at least be in the same bedand at the same school.
Sally, grown-ups make these decisions.
Do you understandIm betraying her confidence?
Im not being dramatic.Now, please, take me seriously.

You know I talked to Sally, dont you?
Yes, of course.

You are definitely not!
I want to be there. The kids need me.
I dont want to upset them.
Its my business.
I didnt even want her to know,
but no one can keep their mouth shut.
I dont want you to worry about them.
Theyll going to come live with me.You dont even have to ask.
I wasnt going to.
Please dont let your prideinterfere with my wishes.
Im their father.
What they really need isa woman in their life.
A regular family.
Living with my brother and Judyis in their best interests.
You dont have the right to decide.
What am I supposed to do?
This way you see them exactlyas much as you do now,
on weekends and...
Oh, wait, Don.When was the last time you saw them?
Betty, I didnt know.
Don, honey, I appreciate your intentions.I really do.
But Im not going to waste the restof my time arguing about this.

I assume you held on to your Rolodexwhen you retired?
Can I taste the wine first?
(CHUCKLES)
You know, you look great.
(LAUGHS)
Thank you.
What do you want?
Every department at Dow departmenthas to make an industrial film
for the national sales meeting,and our scriptjust came in.
I fell asleep on page two of thirty.
How long is this film?
See? You know that.
The producers as drunk as a skunk.I have to replace him.
Do you remember the name of the guywho produced Birds Eye?
Im sure I have his number somewhere.
Its $50,000 for eight minutes.
A good producer could pocket half of it,
but he has to know writers and directors.
And I need it yesterday.
Joan, I cant be eclipsed by plasticsand packaging again.
Relax, Kenny.
For that kind of money,therell be ten men for the job.
Great. So, hows the family?
Wonderful. Hows Eddie?
Hes a little weird, actually.
I think there might besomething wrong with him.
(LAUGHS)
(KNOCKING)
Come in.
We cant ask him for money like this.
(GRUNTS)
Don.
You dont have to come along,but you promised to stake us.
Im coming. Im coming.
Should we pack you?
(DON BREATHING DEEPLY)
Im packed. You can drop me in L.A.
Hello, big sh*t.
I was hoping we could grab lunchor a drink and catch up.
Its so good to hear from you.I thought you forgot about me.
How about the end of next week?
I cant wait. ls your weekend busy?
You really want to catch up?
Well, I ran into Ken, and...
Oh, how is he? Did you tell him I said hi?
Why would you do that?
Dow needs a script yesterdayfor an industrial film.
You know the account and, well,we both thought of you.
I dont have time to moonlight.
Its $1,200 for a ten page script.
Jeez.
Well, anything for a friend.
We can chat when I drop off the research.
Obviously, not there.
Of course.
(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS)
(KNOCKING)
Dick.
Hello.
What are you doing here?Howd you find me?
I was in L.A. I called your folks.
They told me you were in town.
Uh-huh.
And they sent you here for what?
They didnt tell me anythingbut your address.
Pattys pretty mad I gave you money.
Well, thats more than she did.
Do you have any liquor?Ive been drinking beer all night.
Sit down. Ill make coffee.
(EXHALES)
Whats going on?
Nothing much. Im retired.
Been on the road.
Just wanted to see how you were doing.
Meet the little one.
This is bullshit.
Did they fly you in from some drunk t*nkto make me feel guilty?
Stephanie, no.
What happened?
Hes not here.He lives with Ronnies parents. His dad.
I understand.
Listen.
I also thought...
This should be with you.
Megan and I are, well...
Im sorry about that.
Anna always wanted you to have it.
Come on, Dick.What am I going to do with that?
Fine. Sell it.
Is that the problem?You need money?
(SIGHS)
I appreciate you trying to help me out,
but Im pretty sureyoure the one whos in trouble.
A lot has happened.
Youre welcome to crash here.
Im going away for a few days.
I dont wanna put you out.Just need a shower and a shave.
Where you going?
Up the coast.
Its some kind of retreat.
Why dont you close your eyes?Ill open a can of stew.
Okay.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(GRUNTS)
Are you trying to k*ll me?
Im trying to make you happy.
That was our agreement.
(ROGER CHUCKLES)
Du Maurier. They taste like le shit.
(CHUCKLES) I miss them.
Too bad.
Youre done with Canada.
My children live there.Youll learn to love it.
As long as I dont have to seewhats-his-name.
Poor soul. He suddenlydiscovered that he wants me.
You saw Emile?
Oh, he was such a tragic figure.
I hope you told him its too late.
Not everything is your business.
Wait. Did you sleep with him?
Dont raise your voice.Youre not my husband.
You went up there to divorce him.I forbid you to see him.
You are the one thatll throw me overand leave me for your secretary.
You know what a low blow is?
All I got was "suitcase."Yell at me slower or in English.
You live in a hotel.Go get another room.
- What?- Out!
Sleep on the sofa.The televisions in there.
That is your friend.
Youre coming with me.
(SIGHS)
(kn*fe SCRAPING)
Hi, Genie.
Hi, Sally.
I didnt know you were coming home.
I missed you guys. I took the train.
Is it going to happen now?
Is what going to happen?
Gene, go watch TV.
No.
Get out of here.
(FOOTSTEPS LEAVING)
Where are they?
Henrys still at work. Shes lying down.
Thats all she can do.
I dont know what she thinks I think,
but I heard everythingbefore they stopped fighting.
(SIGHS)
I dont know how long she has,
but Im not going to Madrid anymore.
Shes not going to like that.
What happened in here?Smells like a fire.
I was making dinner.
Get the frying pan.Ill show you how to do it.
- Theres someone in here.- Its more communal this way.
Sun salutations at dawn,with yoga and tai chi.
A silent meal at 7:00 a.m.and the seminars begin at 9:00.
Get some rest. Tomorrow isgoing to be beautiful.
You are so generous.
Where are we?
"Psychotechnics?Anxiety and Tension Control?
"Divorce: A Creative Experience?"
Be open to this. You might feel better.
- She took my money. Thats a good sign.- Shh.
(SOMEONE SNORING)
(GRUNTS, YAWNS)
(BED CREAKS)
Good night, Dick.
Careful. Hes a little sticky.
I had pancakes.
- Do you have a minute?- Of course.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Look, Ive been revising my will,and with Margaret lost,
Im dividing most of my estatebetween Ellery and...
Roger.
I know you dont want it, but its for him.
I dont want it to put youin an awkward position
when some man you used to work with
leaves your son a small fortune.
The good doctor, for example.
Greg had twins with some nurse.
As far as hes concerned,Kevin never happened.
So, he knows?
No, hes just a terrible person.
What about the guyyouve been hiding from me?
Richard is a man of the world.
Roger, this is an expensive wayto mark your territory.
What? No.
Ive just been thinking that
you get to a point in your lifewhere its the last chapter...
Are you ill? ls everything okay?
For the time being, butIm getting married.
Well, those skirts arepretty short at McCann.
Nah, I met her through Megan Draper.
Shes old enough to be her mother.
Actually, she is her mother.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Thats spectacular. What a mess.
Youd be surprised. Nobody cares.
I guess somebodyfinally got their timing right.
So, youll accept?
If this is what you really want,Im not going to say no.
It would be a relief to know that,
no matter what, our beautifullittle boy is secure.
Good.
(SIGHS) Get over here.
Little rich bastard.
He really is, I guess.
(LAUGHS)
Thank you.
I didnt want to leave it in the room.
Be open.
Lets go.
Thats right. Just walk around the room.
No aiming.
No purpose,
other than to move your legs.
Thats it.
Stop.
Look at the person nearest you.
What does that person make you feel?
Now, find a way, without words,
to communicate that feelingto the other person.
Does hugging feel honest?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
So happy to see you.
Me, you, as well.
Thats not the only reason I came.
Can we get a couple of Bloody Marys?
Holy shit.
Thats the tip of the iceberg, Peggy.
I never know if thats good or bad.
The director, Jeff Dole,has two more industrials
and hes asked me to produce them.
And they both need scripts.
And when Ken turned your idea in,
they put him in chargeof the corporate presentation.
Its got a $60,000 budget.
I already have a very demanding job.
Do you have a contract?
I really thought youdbe on a beach by now.
Ive been to the beach.
But when I talked to Ken,
I realized it would be easy to turn this
into an actual production company.
Eventually, I could hire writersto help you with the work load.
(LAUGHS) Slow down.
Harris-Olson.
You need two names to make it sound real.
Are you serious?
Could you give us a minute?
We wont answer to anyone.
Itll be something of ours,with our name on it.
Im so flattered.
So?
I dont know.
I cant believe youre hesitating.
How can you work at that place?
Its a huge decision.
Well, you can think about it,
but I need to find someoneby the end of the week.
Find a partner?
Find a writer.


The partnership is just for you.
You dont have to say why youre here.
Why dont you tell mehow youre feeling right now?
I feel like
everyones judging me.
And how does it feel to tell us that?
Like Im a little girland my parents are looking at me
the way that they look at me now.
Like all I do is screw up.
"You shouldnt have dropped out of school.
"You shouldnt have been with a lowlife.
"Shouldnt have gotten pregnant.
"You should have loved being a mother."
Life is full of "shoulds."
Yeah, but I made a mistake,
and I just want to get it together now.
So you can be with your baby?
What? No.
See? They are judging me.
Why dont you tell Angie howit feels to hear her say that?
It makes me feel smalland insignificant, Angie.
What I feel when I hear about your baby
is sadness.
My mother left, and I can tell you
that your baby is gonna spendthe rest of his life
staring at the door
waiting for you to walk in.
(CRYING)
Stephanie, is it okay if I tell you
how this is making me feel?
(SOBBING)
Dont listen to them.
You think this is a big laugh, dont you?
You werent raised with Jesus.
You dont know what happens to people
when they believe in things.
Its true. You think thatI dont want to hear the truth?
I could help you.
I could move to L.A.
I dont know what youre doing.
You show up with some family heirloom.
Youre not my family.Whats the matter with you?
I just know how people work.
You can put this behind you.
Itll get easier as you move forward.
Oh, Dick, I dont thinkyoure right about that.
I have to lie down. Illsee you after dinner.
Im going to split.
Well, Im going to sit hereand look at these four walls.
(LAUGHS) If youre not gonna work,I can try and catch up.
Get the door.
Do you like it here?
(CHUCKLES)
Yeah. Its grown on me.
Joan said she wants to go into business.
Shes going to be a producer
and Id be her partner.
Oh.
You dont like that?
I can have my name on the door,be my own boss.
Thats not a good reason.
You think itll fail?
No. You have such a rare talent.
Stop looking over your shoulderat what other people have.
You dont think I can do it.
(YELLING) I said the opposite.
Youre just excited about being in charge.
Working for a producer?Thats not even what you do.
You have no ambition!
Im just very happy being good at my job.
Ive got nothing else to prove.
Spoken like a failure.
I hope youre really drunk,
because youre going to need an excuse.
Stan.
Theres more to life than work.
Coffee.
Is the coast clear?
Whod you think I was talking to?
Theyre gone.
I could eat a dozen eggs.
Im sorry, but I just found out
I cant go to Old Lyme this afternoon.
I just wanted you to look at a boat.
Sounds lovely,
but Jeffrey says Nathans Frankfurters
wants to show me around.
Coney Island. We can make a day of it.
Its a business meeting.
Because youve started a business?
Well see.
What are you doing?
Its just a couple of little projects.
Dont you want to be with me?
Of course.
But I dont know,
it seems like this might bea chance to build something.
Its going to take all your time,all your energy, and all your attention.
Thats not true.
It is. I did it.
And you loved it.
I want to be with you
and I dont wanna be rooting foryou to fail so that can happen.
Do you want to get married?We can get married.
(PHONE RINGING)
No, I dont want to be back where I was.
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)
This can be different.Were different people.
I want you in my life.
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)
You really want to answer that, dont you?
No, but I probably should.
You act like this is happening to you
but youre making a choice.
I cant just turn off that part of myself.
I would never dream of making you choose.
When somethings wrong, its always wrong.
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)
Hello. Joan Harris speaking.Could you please hold for a second?
Richard. Wait. Youre being silly.
Good luck, Joan.
(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)
Well, hello, Jeff. Sorry about that.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Have you seen Stephanie?
She took off a few hours ago.
Did she say where she was going?
Im sorry. I would have askedif Id known you needed to know, man.
How do I get out of here?My friend took the car.
We can get you a car and driverwith a couple days notice.
Or you could hitch,
but youll be standing there all day.
You can thank Charlie Manson for that.
(SIGHS)
Damn it.
Im sure you can get a ride back withsomeone by the end of the week.
Youre all paid up.
People just come and goand no one says goodbye?
Im sorry, but people are freeto come and go as they please.
I have a person-to-person callfor Peggy Olson
from Donald Draper.
This is Peggy Olson. I accept.
Where the hell are you?
Somewhere in California.
Do you know how angry everyone is?
Did everything fall apart without me?
Its not about that. You just took off.
People were worried.
What have you been doing?
I dont know.
I have no idea.
Look,
I know you get sickof things and you run,
but you can come home.
Where?
McCann will take you back in a second.
Apparently, its happened before.
Dont you want to work on Coke?
I cant.
I cant get out of here.
Don, come home.
I messed everything up.
Im not the man you think I am.
Don, listen to me.
What did you ever do that was so bad?
I broke all my vows.
I scandalized my child.
I took another mans name
and made,
nothing of it.
Thats not true.
I only called because I,
realized I never said goodbye to you.
I dont think you shouldbe alone right now.
Im in a crowd.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Ill see you soon.
Wait.
(CRYING)
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
(PHONE RINGING)
Rizzo.
Its me.
What do you want?
I just got off the phone with Don.
Are you kidding me? Where the hell is he?
California.
But he didnt say where.Im really worried about him.
(SIGHS)
He always does thisand he always comes back.
Hes a survivor. Hes going to be okay.
You didnt hear him.He wasnt making any sense.
Youve got to let him go.
It doesnt mean you stop caring about him.
Im sorry I said thoseshitty things to you.
I dont believe them.
Look, youre going to do greatno matter what you do.
I think you were right.
I mean, Im going to stay.
Good, because I didnt want you to leave.
Then why didnt you just say that?
Because every time Imface to face with you,
I want to strangle you.
And then I miss you when I go away.
And I miss you, I call you on the phone,
and I get the person I want to talk to.
Thats not true.
Yeah, well, I dont know what it is,
but when Im standing in front of you,
I bring out something terrible.
I think about how you came into my life
and how you drove me crazy, and now
I dont even know what to do with myself
because all I want to do is be with you.
What?
What did you just say?
I want to be with you.
Im in love with you.
What?
I love you, P9993-
Oh, my God!
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
Thats what I thought you said.
(STUTTERING) I dont know what to say.
I feel like I cant breathe almost.
I mean, I dont even think about you.
Uh, I mean, I do all the time,
because youre there.
And youre here.
And you make everything okay.
You always do.
No matter what.
I mean, I must be.
Because youre always right.
I cant believe this.
(WATERY LAUGH)
I think Im in love with you, too.
I really do.
(SNIFFS)
Stan?
Are you there?
Stan?
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
What were you saying?
I love you.
Are you waiting for a phone call?
What?
Have you taken something?
You know what? Why dont youcome with me to my seminar?
I cant move.
Sure you can. Im late.
I dont want to walk in by myself.
I guess what I feel is I had my hang-ups.
She had her hang-ups,
but one of us was willingto reduce the conflict.
How would you feel aboutstarting with that next time?
My names Leonard
and I dont know if theres anything
that complicated about me.
Which is why I should be happier, I guess.
Do you remember what I saidto Daniel about "should?"
Well, its good for him. Hes interesting.
But Ive never been interesting to anybody.
I work in an office.
People walk right by me.I know they dont see me.
And I go homeand I watch my wife and my kids.
They dont look up when I sit down.
How does it feel to say that?
I dont know.
Its like no one cares that Im gone.
They should love me.
I mean, maybe they do,
but I dont even know what it is.
You spend your whole life
thinking youre not getting it,people arent giving it to you.
Then you realize theyre trying,
and you dont even know what it is.
I had a dream I was on a shelfin the refrigerator.
Someone closes the doorand the light goes off,
and I know everybodys out there eating.
And then they open the doorand you see them smiling.
And theyre happy to see you,
but maybe they dont look right at you
and maybe they dont pick you.
And then the door closes again.
The light goes off.
