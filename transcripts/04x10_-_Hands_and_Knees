No, no, are you sure youre...
You know,are you sure thats whats going on?
Have you had a rabbit test?
I cant go to my doctor.
Hey, look at me.
Youre overreacting. One step at a time.
Let me take care of this.
Im really sorry.
These things happen, right?
Will you stop being so upset?
Very well, then. Ill wait on your word.
Buck up. Its gonna be fine.
Get me an outside line.
-Francis residence.-its me. Has Sally left for camp yet?
-No.-Can I speak with her?
You can try.
Sally, come in here!
Your father is on the phone.
Talk to him.
-Hello.-I missed you this weekend.
And I have a big surprise for you.
Can you keep a secret?
Do you think your friendsare going to be jealous

Hello.
Lane, youre looking well.
This is unexpected.
Have you brought Nigel?
No, I havent.
Good morning, Lane.Thats quite a reception.
John Gibbons, George Casey,this is Robert Pryce, my father.
-Hello.-Sir.
-Laura will show you inside.-Pleasure to meet you.
Im here to bring you home.
This was not the arrangement.
Rebecca doesnt want to see youunless youre in London.
But Nigel does.
Im here to bring you home.
Ill be at the Warwick until Friday.That should be ample time.
Well, theres no reason to stay, then.
Well, I suppose we should at leastdine together.
Have you plans for this evening?
I do now.
I guess were just a little confused aboutwhat it is were selling.
Senator Murphy would be appreciative
if voters were very aware ofthe hundreds of millions of dollars
hes brought to California.
North American Aviationis a friend of Anaheim.
Pork is only half of it.
The guidance and control systemsin the Minuteman II
have significant civilian potential.
United, TWA, American,theyre gonna want this.
So you never have to saythe word "b*mb," right?
Thats good.
Gentlemen. Dont get up.
How would you feel about avoidingthe idea of defense altogether?
If you think thats best.
Wed prefer somethingmore comprehensive, though.
Defense, cutting-edge technologyand, of course, the Moon.
Weve got a 60% bumpin our advertising budget to $4 million.
I assume this means television.
Were taking this very seriously.
And so are we.
We see this as the beginning of a new era
in the relationshipbetween North American Aviation,
and Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Therell be fewer black barsas the process moves forward.
-Gibby. George.-Don.
-Good to see you both again.-Likewise.
I should get on a planeto the coast immediately.
Why? I thought we were talking aboutMeet the Press.
I dont see Minuteman m*ssilebreaking up the Hillbillies.
I have to go anyway.
Give me those ticketsbefore you go anywhere.
Dont worry. Theyre coming.
Im not worried. Not in the slightest.
My father has come to visit.
I wonder if you mightjoin us for dinner this evening.
I may have plans.
Id consider it a personal favor.
So how long is your visit?
Too short.
So, Father,how have you found your accommodations?
Adequate, sixth floor.
Father likes a view.
I was quite impressed with your office.
I think the views better here.
Hello, gentlemen. Im your bunny, Judy.May I see your key, please?
Lane Pryce.
Are you the keyholderor is this a borrowed key?
I am the keyholder.
May I take your cocktail order, Mr. Pryce?
Three whiskey sours would do.
Shes asking what you want,not how many youve had.
Ill have a nice bourbon.
Whiskey sour sounds good.
And, Judy,
could you see ifthat lovely creature could drop by?
Of course.
So whats your line, Robert?
Carrington Surgical, but I retired.
Father was a salesman.
And, therefore, no stranger toplaces such as these.
Hello. How are you gentlemen this evening?
Quite good, thank you.
Toni, Id like to introduce youto some special guests of mine.
My father Robert and my colleague Don.
I tried to get us booked in your section,but it seems youre very popular.
Mr. Pryce.
I hope you gentlemen enjoyyour evening with us,
and let me know if theres anything I can do.
We will.
Shes the finest waitress-
Id be partial to anyonewho brings us our drinks.
Hello, may I help you?
-Is this the Francis home?-It is.
Im special Agent Norrisand this is special Agent Landingham
from the Department of Defense.May we come in?
What is this regarding?
I promise theres no reason to be alarmed.
I... Well, I dont know what this is regarding,
but Im sure youd ratherspeak with my husband,
and hes not home, obviously.
We need to speak with you.
Your ex-husbandDonald Draper has requested
security clearance regarding business withthe United States Government,
and its our job to confirm his application.
Its a routine background check, so,you see, theres no reason to be nervous.
No, of course.
Do you mind if I get my cigarettes?
Of course not.
So, Mrs. Francis, you were married toDonald Draper for how long?
Eleven years.
And, in general, would you describe himas a man of integrity?
We divorced. We obviously had differences.
No, of course.
Do you recall any of the magazinesor newspapers
Mr. Draper read when you were married?
Anything that struck you as radicalor subversive in nature?
No. He read, but mostly for work.
Did he belong to any clubsor organizations?
New York Athletic Club.
Would you describe him as loyal?
Excuse me?
By that, we meananything that might have given you
doubts about Mr. Drapersallegiance to the United States.
Any possible ties or sympathies tothe Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
No, nothing like that.
So, do you have any reason to believeMr. Draper isnt who he says he is?
What was that? Im sorry.
Its a standard question.I know it sounds funny.
No.
Its Mrs. Francis. Are you in?
Ill take it. And, Megan,can you check on those tickets?
Of course.
-Hello.-I just spent 40 minutes
-with two men from the government.-What?
Couldnt you have at leastgiven me some warning?
Betts, I dont knowwhat youre talking about.
Well, you applied forsome security clearance,
and they need to know all about youand Ive been through hell, Don.
Im sick to my stomach.
Hold on.
-What exactly happened?-What?
Who were they?
Two men from the Defense Department,
and they asked me all kindsof questions about you.
-About what?-I dont remember everything.
Your military service, your politics,your loyalty, your name.
And what did you say?
What do you think I said? Nothing.
Hello? Are you there?
Im sorry. I...
Jesus.
I didnt know anything about this.
I dont know ifI should even be talking on the phone.
Of course you should.
Theres no problem with any of that.
You know,my husband works for the governor.
You shouldve told me they were coming.
Youre right.Im sorry for inconveniencing you.
Okay. Well, goodbye, then.
-Betty.-Yes?
Thank you.
Megan, have I been contacted bythe Department of Defense?
Yes, of course. There was a form.
-I filled it out, you signed it.-What?
Two weeks ago. I have it.Did you want to change something?
-I never looked at it.-But you signed it.
Why didnt you tell me what it was?
Its standard information.Its in your employment records.
Just your name, Social Security number,marital status.
This is very serious, Megan.I should have been consulted.
We have a contact number.
Im sure you can changeanything you need to.
Oh, God, Im so embarrassed.
Youre right. Youre absolutely right.
If you want to fire me,Id understand completely.
Is Mr. Campbell still at lunch?
-Yes.-Let me know the minute he returns.
Bye.
-How did you get in here?-I paid someone.
Nigel didnt come. Hes not coming.
Im sorry, baby,but you cant do what youre doing,
and you cant do what you did last night.
-Youre gonna cost me my job.-I know. I know.
I apologize.
You know that I love you,
my chocolate bunny.
Stop it.
I love you, too.
I just wanted Father to meet you.
Well, that was a silly way to do it.
And I dont know whyyoure asking for trouble.
No. Youre in my life.
I want him to know why Im staying.
Why do you have to be so damn dashing?
Ill ring you.
What kind of man are you?
Youve used this woman,and youve ruined her.
Hold on a second...
A man of your age,only slightly younger than myself,
that you could behavewith such selfishness, such irresponsibility.
We came here for your discretion,not your judgment.
I know why you came here.
Theres a good man, hes not in the city.
He has a practice in Morristown. Its $400.
Here.
I dont want it in my handwriting.
Shut the door.
Were you aware thatwe applied for a security clearance
to the Department of Defense?
Did that go through already?
Pete.
They interviewed Betty. G-men.
Why did you fill out the form?
Megan did.
And I signed it without looking,because thats what I do.
What did Betty say?Youve been fine this long.
Theres three lies in eight questions here.
If they talk to his family, he was an engineer.My age is wrong.
Jesus. I didnt even think about it.
I remember you mentioned once.
Dont you have a friend there?
And whats he supposed to do?
Stop it. k*ll it.At least find out how far its gone.
Calm down. Let me think.
Look, this isnt your problem.I just want some warning.
Why? What are you gonna do?
Whatever I have to.
You can run the agency without me.
Are you kidding me?
Ill look into it. Immediately. Okay?
I hate this.
Not that I would change anything,but I hate that it happened.
You know, not the first part, but this.
I understand.
Dont you feel the same way?I mean, what if this is a sign?
I havent stopped thinking about you.
Maybe Im in love with you.
So you want to keep it?
No, of course not, but its just...
I mean, if theres going to besomething between us,
I dont want it to start this way.
Do you? With a scandal?
I see.
But I guess you could keep it.
I mean, when he comes home,whos gonna know the difference?
Lots of Gls came home to a little surprise.No one did the math.
It wouldnt be my child.Lets make that clear.
I mean, if he comes home.
Jesus.
-Greg dying is not a solution to this.-Okay, okay.
Im desperate.
Im just trying to think ofwhats best for you.
Im going to take care of it.
Well... Whatever you want.
Ill take care of it, obviously.
-When?-Immediately.
And I dont want you to come.
You sure? At least let me drive you.
We shouldnt be seen together.
I dont need you to come.
Look, Im sorry I missed dinner.
Its fine, Henry. I know that youre working.
Dont say it like that.
Im just tired. its late.
I have to tell you something.
Two men came from the FBI today.
What?
They interviewed me for 45 minutesabout Don.
Why?
Some kind of security clearance.
Really?
Well, thats what they do.
Is that what youre upset about?
Please dont make me feel silly.
I didnt know ifI was allowed to say anything.
You can always tell me.
And if everything goes as I hope,
one day you may betalking to those people on my behalf.
I just wanted you to know they were here,
because I dont...
Well, I dont want any secrets.
Okay.
Ive got it.
Take the next one.
Hes looking into it.
How many people does he have to talk to?
If youre askingif he knows how to keep a secret,
he works for the Department of Defense.
But he talks to you?
Its going to be okay.I was thinking about this,
and I know itll be uncomfortable,but if we have to, we can ride it out.
-Are you crazy?-This many years later?
It must be past the statute of limitations.
Its desertion.
Theres no statute of limitations.
I thought nobody cared about these things.
What am I supposed to do?
I dont know. Youve been doing it for years.
I dont have to livewith your shit over my head.
You know, I signed this accountafter you disappeared in California.
Its taken three years,but Ive grown it from cocktails to $4 million.
Get rid of it.
Good morning. Mr. Keller is here.Would you like some coffee?
No, thank you.
I appreciate you seeing meon such short notice.
Well, you said you couldntdiscuss it over the phone,
so I assume its serious.
Well...
Im interested in setting upsome kind of trust for my kids.
Well, starting from when?Eighteen years old? Twenty-one years old?
Now.
And I want it to be the kind of accounttheir mother can access.
Don, why would she need anything?
Look,
if circumstances conspire,
shell know why.
I dont like this. I dont like this at all.
An emergency meeting and... Ill be honest.You seem very edgy.
-Whats going on?-Nothing.
It just ran through my mind thatmaybe Im not prepared.
I know this has been hard on you,the divorce, but dont go spinning.
Everybody has bad dreamsevery once in a while.
The wound is still fresh. Itll heal in time.
Just tell me that youll do that,and Ill sleep better.
Okay, but Ill tell you,I dont like hearing that tone in your voice.
Dont worry. Im fine.
Now, please tell meyoure shtupping that girl out there.
Hillary.
Are you sure you dont want me to come in?
Are you all right?
Yes.
Im sure I will be in a minute.
Shes 17 years old. What do I say to her?
I had her when I was 15, and I dont regret it,
but she seems so much younger.
Shes very beautiful.
Thank you.
She is.
Im sorry.
Theres no one to talk to.
I understand.
Thank you for being so sweet.
How old is your daughter?
Im sorry. I shouldnt pry.
Fifteen.
Dr. Miller is here to see you.
Send her in.
I owe you a phone call, dont I?
Yes, you do.
Are you all right? What happened?
Ive been snowed under. I shouldve called.I shouldve called today. I have to cancel.
You look sick.
-You have a fever.-Yeah, I havent been feeling well.
-Let me take you home.-Ill be fine.
Come on, get your coat.
This pretty young thing,she didnt know which way to turn
with my father on one end of the halland my uncle on the other.
Shouldve tried that move at Gettysburg.
My grandpa fought in the Civil w*r.
Really? Where did he surrender?
He never surrendered.
That man could turngoing to the shitter into a parade.
-What are you doing?-Im getting this.
Why would you do that?
Sometimes a fellas gotta pick up the check.
Since when?
You know that I like you, Roger.Hell, youre a genuine character.
Im sorry. Thats the long and the short of it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Its over.
Im sorry.
Are you kidding me?
Are you trying to k*ll me? Is that your plan?
If you want to put us through our paces,
we will shake heaven and earth for you.You know that.
Just tell me its for show beforehand,because, I swear, youre going to k*ll me.
Roger, it wasnt my decision.


Since Daddys incapacitation,
the board has been more aggressive,
and thats never been my bailiwick.You know that.
But they want to consolidate everything.One agency, one rate,
all the ad work, all the brands.
So fine, lets.... You know what?
Get Draper in a room with them.Where do they want to go?
Where do you think? BBDO.
You think youll get the kind of attentionyou get at Sterling Cooper?
Well, youre not Sterling Cooper anymore.
Thats right.Were better, and Were devoted to you.
Oh, hell. I dont want you to thinkthis is for cause. Theres no reason.
Theres nothing you can do.Nothing you could do.
Its just the way it is.
Wait. This is not happening.
You dont just end business with peopleafter 25... 30 years!
Were family.
I invited you to my daughters wedding.
I dont knowwhy you didnt get the invitation.
You should fire your secretaryis what you should do,
not fire your agency!
Were dead. You know that.
The question is when?
Were gonna call for the files on Monday.
No, you cant do that. Im begging you.
You cant do that.Youve gotta give me some time.
I told you, Roger. Its done.
Youre not gonna win these fellas over.
-Give me 30 days.-Whats that gonna do?
After all the lies Ive told for you,you owe me that!
I dont owe you squat.
You inherited this account.
Thirty days.
Keep it under your hat.
Give me a chance to get our affairs in order.
Im begging you.
Okay. I can do that.
Thank you.
No hard feelings.
-Excuse me.-Yes?
Im really sorry.Were looking for the Vernons.
I dont know them.
-Is this 110 Waverly?-No.
Whatd I tell you? Sorry about that.
-Are you all right?-Dont...
Im gonna get you a glass of water.Sit down.
Are you all right?
I think Im having a heart attack.
Are you in pain? Is it in your chest?
No, but I cant breathe.
Stop it. Please, dont touch me.
If theres no pain,youre not having a heart attack.
Youre not a real doctor.
My father has a heart condition.Ive been through this, okay?
You should go.
Im not going anywhere.Im not leaving you like this.
-Good evening.-Good evening, Father. Do come in.
Father, come with me.Id like you to meet someone.
Properly this time.
Toni Charles, this is my father Robert Pryce.
-How do you do?-A pleasure to meet you again.
How are you Ending the city?Are you enjoying yourself?
I am.
Very well, then. What do you saywe all head to dinner and get acquainted?
As delightful as that sounds,Im afraid Im traveling tomorrow.
Im terribly sorry.
Well, thats too bad.
But please, go on ahead.I dont want to ruin your evening.
Well, of course.
Toni, why dont you run along ahead,and Ill join you in a bit?
Dont want to lose our reservation.
Well, it was a pleasure to meet you.Lane said so many nice things about you.
Yes.
Ill be right along, darling.
Come along. Out with it.
I see your face.
Are you more distraught thatI found someone I love,
or that shes a n*gro?
Youre coming home, Lane.
Im afraid Ive moved on!
Put your home in order.
Either there, or here.
You will not live in between.
What was that?
Yes.
What was that?
Yes, sir.
Darling, whats wrong?
I cant tell you.
Peter, look at me.
Is there something I should know?
Trudy, no. its nothing to do with you.Come here.
You should talk to me. Youll feel better.
How is it thatsome people just walk through life,
dragging their lies with them,destroying everything they touch?
-Who are you talking about?-I loathe it.
No one ever knows.
Except the honest peoplewho have to pick up the pieces.
I dont know what youre talking about,
and I want to.
No, you dont.
And I dont want you to.
You can tell me anything.
What was that?
Just a kick. Hes turning over. Feel.
Just remember, everythings good here.
No, we dont go to East Hampton anymore.We go to Southampton.
Its a rental, but its a beaut.
So listen, its been wonderful catching up,
but I have to admitIm calling for Larry, actually.
What?
No.
God, Im so sorry to hear that.
When did that happen?
I mean,
when did he go?
I mean, what happened?
Louise, Im so sorry.
I obviously didnt know.I mustve been out of town.
Do you want something to help you sleep?I might have a Valium.
Why didnt you tell me that two hours ago?
I dont know. I just thought of it.I never take them.
Thank you for staying.
I dont know what happened.
I think you do.
Those men,
who did you think they were?
Im so tired.
Please, tell me whats wrong.
Its me.
Im tired of running.
Running from what?
In Korea, I was wounded,
but this other man was k*ll,and they mixed us up.
I wanted them to.
And I
just kept living
as him.
Oh, my goodness.
Yup.
But, now, I think thats over.
What happened?
North American Aviationtold the government
they need to know who I am.
What are you gonna do?
Theres nothing to do.
Well, cant you get a lawyer?
You were a kid.
Turn yourself in,have someone plead for clemency.
Its not that simple.
There are things you can do.
I shouldnt have told you,
but Im just so damn tired of all of it.
Hey,
Im glad you told me.
I dont want to talk at the office,and I dont want to talk over the phone.
Come in.
I spoke to Russ,
and you havent been flagged.
And if we end things with NAA,the investigation will stop where it is.
Thank God.
So I walk away from $4 million,
and I just keep this to myself, because why?
Because you cant live in the open?
You dont know any other way.
I come here unannounced andtheres another thing I dont want to know.
Tell NAA we want Martin Marietta or Hughes.
And what do I tell the partners?
I called your house a hundred timeslast night.
Im fine. Everything went fine.
Should you even be here?Should you be on your feet?
Roger.
Oh, God. I wish I could hold you right now.
Its okay. I feel good.
I feel awful.
We avoided a tragedy.
What? Yeah.
We have a partners meeting.
Christ. Really?
Come on. Life goes on.
Youre so beautiful.
-Gentlemen.-Morning.
Let me call to ordera meeting of the partners. In attendance...
Get on with it.
I dont know how to explain it,but I have some serious news.
North American Aviation is moving on.
What happened?
There was a misunderstanding.Some names were left off of a document.
A General was insulted.I apologized, but the damage was done.
Well, thats just great.
What General?
Unfortunately, this is irreparable.
How can that be?
Because I didnt pay enough attention.
Thats your only damn job.
I swear, when I thinkwhat were trying to do here,
when all you had to dois hold their hands and jerk em off.
Is that so hard to do, Campbell?
We have to come in here andhave this catastrophe dropped into our lap
because you dont knowwhat the hell youre doing,
-because you f*cked up!-Hey!
Roger.
Thats the business were in,accounts come in, accounts go out.
Roger, I think you should apologize.
Im sorry.
I have an announcement.
Im going to be taking a leave of absence.Two weeks, perhaps a month,
to return to London and tend to my family.
I shall be reachable by telex and telephone.
And I can say with full confidencethat the company is in a state of stability,
