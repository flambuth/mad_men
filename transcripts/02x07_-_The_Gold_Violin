Afraid youIl fall in love?
Something like that.
WelI, I can see you have good taste.
This is the one.
1 962 Coupe de Ville.
Does everything but make breakfast.
What are you in now?
I had a Dodge.
Those are wonderfulif you want to get somewhere.
This is for when youve already arrived.
Is that right?
Of course, someone like you,
you dont need to see yourself in a Cadillac.
Youre walking about in one every day.
Howd you like your car to look like that?
Look at you.
I bet youd be as comfortable in one of these
as you would in your own skin.
Wayne Kirkby. Do you have a card?
Sterling Cooper.
Did Roger Sterling send you?
Yes.
Let me go and get the keys, Mr. Draper.
Dont you want to hold onto these?
I dont know. The 49 rattled.
This is the 1 950 model.
Its quite different under the hood.
Dont talk to me.
Talk to him. Its his money.
Im just here to make sure
you dont shake his handand take his fingers.
Charlie, this car is two years oldwith only 25,000 miles on it.
Its what you want.
This must be Mrs. Wheatley.
No.
Why dont you sit in it again?
You two talk.
May l help you, maam?
Are you Donald Draper?
Yes, I am.
If its about my circular,many of the models are gone,
but lm sure we can find you something.
Im not here to buy a car.
Youre a hard man to find.
Excuse me?
Youre not Don Draper.
Mr. Draper?
Everything okay?
Yes.
Let me take you for a ride.
No.
Thank you.
I dont hear that a lot.
Well.
Have a good day.
Good afternoon, Miss Siegal.
Mr. Sterling.
Is your boss in?
No, but he will be.
Whered you get that sweater?
l want to make suremy daughter never buys it.
Kleins.
I doubt your daughter shops there.
Union Square, right?Is that where you live?
Ive told you, all you have to dois look at my file.
Thats cheating.
How was your lunch, Mr. Draper?
Good.
Mr. Sterlings here to see you.
Get Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Draper, Mrs. Barrett called again.
Did she leave a message?
No.
ShalI I tell Mr. Phillips you returned?
Yes.
Ill bet she suffers in silence out there,hoping youll notice her.
I dont think she cries at nightfrom lack of attention.
Wait till she finds out about your Cadillac.
Shell be waiting nakedright in front of this window.
Now youre thinking about her.
Didnt you go see Wayne?
Im going to eliminateyour objections right away.
First of all, you can afford it.
Do you know how invigorating it is
to go in and write a check for $6,500and not care?
Secondly,
not to get too deepbefore the cocktail hour,
but do I need to remind youof the finite nature of life?
Mr. Phillips.
Send him in.
Like the song says, enjoy yourself.
Its later than you think.
Martinson Coffee.
Martinsons.
They changed it.
Change it back.
Jim Van d*ke told the people at Greytheyre under review.
So Grey must be scrambling.
Its hard for them to do a lot of new work.
They just redesigned labels,displays, and dropped the S,
but they have some kidsworking on print and TV.
Are they better than our kids?
Well find out.
WelI, youre welcome.
I spent Saturday birding with that man,
and by birding l mean sitting on a stump
with a pair of binoculars, whispering.
Did you see anything unusual?
A refrigerator floating in a pond.
Mr. Smith and Mr. Smith are here.
Just a minute.
Did you let them stay up late?
- Id love to hear this.- l dont know.
If l fill you full of any moreconfidence, youll burst.
You dont dance,or you dont dance with me?
Leave her alone. Lets go.
Heard youre gonna knock em dead.
Look, Don, its pretty clearwhy were here.
You want to knowhow our generation feels.
Okay.
So, I get this letterfrom my friend back in Michigan.
Hes still in school, man,
and its got this, I dont know,
60-page rant in it.
So dig it.
"We would replace power
"rooted in possession,privilege, or circumstance
"by power and uniqueness
"rooted in Iove, reflectiveness,
reason, and creativity."
Thats a beautiful sentiment.
Does your friend knowwhat you do for a living?
Yeah, there was a shitty note with it,
but this whole concept is deep.
"Students for a Democratic Society."
Thats a hell of a focus group.
Its how our generation feels.
It is what it is.
Its idealistic.
Thats nice.
Your generation wants to talk
about that newly designed canand the premium beans,
but we dont want to be toldwhat we should do
or how we should act.
We just want to be.
You just want to beselling Martinsons Coffee?
Just listen to this.
So, the thought is,
every maternity ward will get a visitfrom a registered nurse
with a doll and a crate of Pampers,
and she will extol their virtues,which are many.
What did Draper say?
He liked it,
but he said the same thinghe keeps saying.
I cant get them to lower the price.
Do you know the years of R&DP&G put into this?
Besides, theyre worth it.
No boiIing, no diaper service,no plastic pants.
And the greatest benefit of all,you can throw them away.
1 0 cents apiece,
you kind of think you should reuse them.
Mr. Draper went over these ideas
and had thoughts he wouldlike you all to discuss.
WelI, its 5:00. Are we going out?
I dont know, sweetheart.
Maybe.
Ill take those papers.
Good night, Miss Olson.
Jane, would you mindhelping us clean this up?
Im meeting with Cooper tomorrow.
He said he wants to see me and only me.
Isnt that from West Side Story?
You know hes goingto ask you about the picture.
What picture?
Some new painting.
He calls people in to see what they think.
No, I think were going to discussexpanding the television department.
I heard it cost $1 0,000.
How does everybody know about this?
Are you making it up?
Last year, Harry went up to the rooflooking for cosmonauts.
Has anyone seen it?
Dale.
Its abstract expressionist.
What the hell does that mean?
Thank you all for ruining this.
Youre the one who walkedto the opposite end of the office
to tell us you had a meeting.
Well, if youre lucky,youIl have a meeting.
And Im not going to telI you anythingabout the damn picture.
Why dont you just go look at it?
Im sorry, Jane,
but you just dont walkinto his office like that.
But hes gone for the day.
That doesnt matter.
Miss Blankenship wont mind .
Im going to go up and see it.
Ill go anywhere you go.
WelI, shes gone.
What are you doing?
Its open.
Are you suicidal? Lets go.
I cant believe you all.
Take off your shoes.
I feel like were skinny dipping.
Call me from jail.
Youre gonna keep a lookout?
Just dont touch anything.
Its a Rothko.
Why the hell didnt Dale say that?
$1 0,000.
So its smudgy squares?
Thats interesting.
Two possibilities--
either Cooper loves it,
and you have to love it,
like in an "Emperors New Clothes" situation,
or he thinks its a joke
and youll look like a foolif you pretend to dig it.
People like him pretendthey understand this.
Maybe he has a brochure in here,something that explains it.
I dont think its supposed to be explained .
Im an artist, okay?
It must mean something.
Maybe it doesnt.
Maybe youre just supposedto experience it.
Because when you look at it,you do feel something, right?
Its like looking into something very deep.
You could fall in.
Thats true.
Did someone tell you that?
How could someone tell you that?
This is pointless. Lets go.
Im ready.
Harry actually took the stairs.
We could have stolen it, couldnt we?
Who are you?
I was thinking I could writea great short story about this--
you know, "The Day We Lookedat the Painting."
Im a writer.
I thought you were an accountant.
Accounts.
Ive been published.
The Atlantic Monthly, Parabolas.
Thats right.The story about the maple tree.
It was beautiful and sad.
Really? You read it?
Everybody read it.
People were jealous.
Where are you headed?Are you hungry?
No. Good night.
So youre stilI working here.
You missed something,my yellow-bellied friend.
Jane Siegal is a genuine thrill.
Breaking and entering.
I dont care about Jane.
Tell me about Coops painting.
What about Mr. Coopers painting?
Enjoy that.
Can l get another coffee here, please?
Ill tell you what I heard.
You, Mr. Cosgrove, and Jane
were in Mr. Coopers officelooking at his painting.
Anything youd like to correct?
Mind your own business.
I had nothing to do with it.
Thank you.
Nothing happened.
Look, if Kurt says we dont need artwork,we dont need artwork.
Is that what Kurt said?
Is that what you said?
Don has his signature.
Its nice down here.
Hey.
Kenneth.
3:00, and he doesnt talk in the meeting.
How about last night?
Quite an adventure.
Listen, I was thinking aboutwhat you said about my story,
about it being sad and beautiful?
Youre not Iike everyone else around here.
I dont know if thats true.
Okay. Here goes.
Would you mind taking a look at this?
Are you kidding?
I dont want you to pull any punches.
Unless you hate it,
in which case, dont tell me.
Im kind of fragile.
Id be honored.
WelI, great, then.
Take your time.
Ken.
Yeah.
You know, I can probablyread it by Sunday,
and you can come over for dinner,
you know, with Kitty and I .
I know you need a home-cooked meal.
You have plans?
No.
Are you sure its okay?
You want me to give this back?
Young people do not drink coffee,
and that can become a lifetime habit.
Now, were aware
that unsuccessful attemptshave been made--
puppets and so forth--
to capture the attention of youth.
Thats why were here.
Theres an old saying.
When one is in Indian country,
one needs a man who knows Indians.
Mr. Smith?
So.
Where do we start?
Joe Martinson.
Old cup of Joe.
They named it after him, right?
Thats just ancient history now.
There have been a million waysthat the folks on this avenue
have tried to telI our generation what to do.
Except we dont want to be told what to do.
Thats over.
We want to find things for ourselves.
We want to feel.
Okay.
Martinsons is a great coffee.
Its delicious, and its hot, and its brown.
Thats all you need to say.
We dont need more than that.
Peggy. Sweetheart?
I dont know if I understand this.
Its a jingle, right?
Its a song, and its a mood,
and its a feeling.
Its definitely more than a jingle.
What do you think?
It stays with you.
What are the pictures that go with this?
If you sign, well tell you.
So Media Purchases.
Starting in March,Im looking at column 5,
under Regional Affiliates.
Mr. Crane, focus, please.
We didnt make you head of televisionjust to shorten your attention span.
Im sorry, sir.
I was admiring your painting.
The eye is drawn to it.
Its very modern.
Mark Rothko. Ive read about him.
And?
What do you think about it?
Nobody has ever asked me that.
Probably because its none of their business.
Right.
How does it strike you?
Sir, I know nothing about art.
Mr. Crane, youre here because of numbers.
Stick to that.
Dont concern yourseIf with aesthetics.
Youll get a headache.
Of course.
People buy thingsto realize their aspirations.
Its the foundation of our business.
But between you and meand the lamppost,
that thing shouId doublein value by next Christmas.
Where were we?
Column 5 here--Regional Newspaper Affiliates.
Your hair is turning green.
You have to wear the bathing cap.
It squeezes my head .
Dont leave your wet suit on the floor.
Draper residence.
Is this the belle of the Hudson River Valley?
Who is this?
Its Jimmy Barrett, sweetheart.
Mr. Barrett.
Are you Iooking for Don?
Because hes at the office.
I know exactly what Im doing.
ABC picked up Grin and Barrett,my TV show, 39 episodes.
Thats wonderful. Congratulations.
Were having a shindig at the Stork Club.
Donnie didnt get back to me,
so I figured if youre anything like my wife,
you book the dance card.
Monday night,so the celebrities can come.
That sounds like fun,
but celebrities make me shy.
Keep playing that, gorgeous.
It works wonders.
Ill talk to Don about it.
Dont you want to go?
You cant leave me alonewith those people.
Ride the horse in, like Lady Godiva.
I think I should hang up now.
Betty,
it would mean a lot to meif you were there.
We wiIl try. Have a nice day, Jimmy.
Mr. Phillips.
Right now theres a little boy
running over here from Martinson Coffee
with a check in his hand.
Its done. Congratulations.
Thanks.
You want me to sendfor something for you?
No, but dont let medampen your spirits.
Unfurl the sails, please.
That was good advance work.
Thats my job.
Maybe well get a sh*t at LifeSavers.
Mr. Cooper wants to speak with you.
Well be right there.
He just asked for you, Mr. Draper.
Thanks again.
CongratuIations, Don.
Sit with us.
Thank you.
But I didnt do it alone.
Fascinating.
Jim Van d*ke of Martinson Coffeewas thoroughly impressed.
Hes inviting you to join the board
of the Museum of Early American Folk Arts.
Thats nice.
What is it?
Doesnt exist yet.
But Ive seen the opening exhibit.
Whirligigs.
Do they need a campaign?
No. Philanthropy is the gateway to power.
If you say so.
We need you to continueyour excellence in advertising,
but also to start treating thislike part of a bigger business,
which it is.
I will.
Do you understand what this means?
Youre going to be wearingyour tuxedo a lot more.
Its time for the horse to catch the carrot.
Roger, would you mind?
Would you agree that l knowa little bit about you?
A little.
There are few people who get to decidewhat will happen in our world .
You have been invited to join them.
Pull back the curtainand take your seat.
Youre back.
I had a feeling.
You want to take it for a drive?
Wayne, I would like to buy this car.
Jane, would you come with me, pIease?
Is something wrong?
Just tell me.
You want to have this conversation here?
Fine.
You broke into Mr. Coopers officewith some executives after hours.
Thats not true.
Im not in the habitof making empty accusations.
They made me. l had no choice.
Please. Theyll do anything you say.
You work for Mr. Draper.
Whats wrong with you?
With me?
Yes.
Are you the only one whos allowedto have fun around here?
What?
Please. I dont need a mother.
Im 20 years old .
Collect your things.
What?
Get your things.
You cant be serious.
You want to have this conversation againin front of Mr. Draper?
Im going to the break roomto find your replacement.
See that you are goneby the time I return.
Don!
You like it?
I dont know what to say.
Its gorgeous.
Slide over.
Its like the cockpit of a jet.
Whats this for?
That is a headlight sensor.
It automatically dims the lightsas you approach another car.
And these seats.
It was expensive.
- Do you love it?- I do.
WelI, you deserve it. You work so hard.
I cant wait to pull upto the Stork Club in this.
Any time you want.
Monday night?
Jimmy Barretts throwinga party for his TV show.
He called for you.
He called here?
He should have gonethrough my secretary.
I think he likes talking to me.
The kids wont be home for an hour.
Want to take her around the block?
Not in here.
Mr. Sterling?
Im sorry. Ginger stepped away.
Well. Hello there.
I just wanted to say good-byeand thank you for being so kind to me.
Good-bye?
Ive been fired.
Drapers a tough desk, honey.
Actually, it was Miss Holloway.
I can see someone wantingto reprimand you seriously.
But firing? Its a little permanent.
Do you want a drink?


Not like you work here anymore.
Would you Iiketo tell me what happened?
You dont need to bother with this.
I want to.
Im just trying to do my job.
Miss Holloway is. . .
WelI, shes going through a rough time.
Shes engaged, you know.
Tell you what.
You go home--
Where do you live?
In the Village.
Jane Street.
Jane on Jane Street.
Thats a pretty picture.
Listen, you go hometo your little apartment on Jane Street.
By the time you come back hereon Monday morning,
this will all be taken care of.
Are you sure?
No more tears.
I dont know what to say.
Thank you, Mr. Sterling.Thank you so much.
Roger.
Thats my favorite tie.
Hes late. I was expecting that.
He is a bachelor.
You could smell heaven in the street.
Id like to take credit,but its all the maestro.
These are beautiful.
Dont forget to putan aspirin in the bottom.
Keeps em fresh.
I know that. I told you that.
Can l offer you a drink?
Beer if you have it.
But wine with the spaghetti. Okay?
Your place is. . .really wild.
Once we decided notto look for a bigger place,
we just Iet ourselves go.
How did you two meet?
Its a boring story.
No, its not.
I grew up a block away from himin Baltimore.
l guess I just always hada crush on an older man.
As soon as I moved my mother up here,Kitty came along.
Come, come. Taste this sauce.
Now, tell me what you think,and be honest.
Im fragile.
Its really good.
Its better than a restaurant.
I dont want this hanging in the air.
- What are you talking about?- My story.
I dont want to sit herethe whole meal worrying
and then find out you didnt read itor that you did and you didnt like it.
Are you kidding? I loved it.
- Loved what?- His story.
Yes. He wouldnt stop talking about it,but he wont let me read it.
I didnt know how you felt.
I wonder if one daytheyll rent this apartment
by bragging about the factthat you ate here once.
Im going to be eating here all the time.
To "The Gold Violin,"by Kenneth Cosgrove.
You really liked it?
I did. It was lovely.
I saw one at the Met.
Its perfect in every way,except it couldnt make music.
Oh, my.
Well, shall we?
Is Bobby in the car again?
No. Hes running around.
So I dont understand.
Youd rather play checkersthan my "look at the clouds" game.
Id rather play with Silly Putty.
I dont want it jammed between my seats.
You know what, Sally?Go play with Bobby.
We should do this more often.
We should only do this.
I have to go pee-pee.
Go behind a tree there.No ones looking.
I want to tinkle outside.
I dont know.
Its different for boys.
I think everybody should gobefore we get in the car.
Do you have to go?
No.
You kids are lucky.
When l was a little boy,
back on the farm,
we had an outhouseway out in the yard.
And on nightswhen there was no moon,
there was this rope,
and you had to feeI for it in the darkand pull yourself across.
Im glad we didnt live in the olden days.
Are we rich?
Its not polite to talk about money.
I did it!
We should probably get goingif we dont want to hit traffic.
Sally, pack up the checkers.
Check their hands.
Okay.
You get the last of it.
Should I get another?
You can have mine.
Harry tell you anything about his meeting?
Harrys meeting with who?
Mr. Cooper.
He says he knows the answer now.
Well? What was it?
He says I wouldnt understand.
Where do you live, Ken?
Murray Hill.
I can waIk to the office, but I dont.
I wonder if youre gonna get a call.
Im pretty sure hes goingthrough the whole roster.
Although, Cosgrovecomes before Crane, right?
My cousin has an advertising agencyin Montreal.
Hes not interested in that.
How the heck did youend up in accounts?
Me and a bunch of my college buddiesheard there was dough.
I was the only one who got a job.
What about writing?
Thats just for fun.
Its your hobby.
I should go.
You cant.
Dont you want coffee?
Would it be rude to say that I havea long ride back to Manhattan?
I can wrap up a piece of pie for you.
- Its pine nuts and pineapple.- If I eat any more,
Ill burst.
You two have been wonderful.
Thanks for reading the story.
You can let her read it.
I cant wait.
Ill see you tomorrow, l guess.
Do you want to have some pie?
No. Im not hungry.
Im just going to clean up.
Do you even care that l want dessert?
Of course I do. Ill go get it.
Ill get it.
Whats the matter, Kitty?
I dont work where you do.
Ive met these people once.
How am l supposed to talk about them?
Come on, Kitty.
Do you even see me here?
Well, of course I do.
WelI, you wouldnt know it, Salvatore.
Im sorry.
We were just talking about work.
Youre right.
It was rude.
I tried to include myseIf.
A lot of people find mevery interesting, you know?
I am so sorry, Kitty.
Its okay.
Ill get you some pie.
You put your feet up.
Ill take care of the kitchen.
Okay.
I have tickets for the Mets tonight.
Great seats for probably a terrible game.
Ill be by at 5.
No, you wont,and please dont lurk near my desk.
Im being watched.
Okay.
WelI, have a good day.
Good morning.
Morning.
I was going to calI Kitty today,
but I dont know whatits like with Italian people
if you call someones wife.
Its okay.
Give her a call. Shed like that.
WelI, I just wanted to thank her--both of you, really.
Every once in a while,
you wish you werenta bachelor, you know?
And your home is kind ofwhat l have in mind,
the way you two are.
WelI, we really enjoyed having you.
What on Gods green earthare you doing here?
Did Mr. Sterling speak with you?
No.
What could he possibly have to do with this?
Ill do whatever you want,but he said that you do this a lot.
Do what?
Lose your temper.
That youre impetuousand its not serious.
And what were you doingtalking to Mr. Sterling?
I ran into him on my way out.
Did you?
Is there a problem?
No.
Theres no problem at aIl.
Its very clear.
Everyone looks so glamorous.
Believe me,theyre saying that about you.
Its my earrings.
Do you remember? Bermuda?
I do.
Here he is.
Don Draper.
I heard you had somethingto do with this.
Very little.
Betty, this is Andrew Colhold with ABC.
A pleasure to meet you.
And you.
Isnt this a pleasant surprise?
Hello, Mrs. Draper.You look stunning.
Don.
Hello, Mrs. Barrett.
Don, did Andrew tell you my ideafor working a few items into the show?
Not yet.
Why dont I get us some drinks?
Thats okay. Let me get them.
Ill do it.
No, it sounds like you threehave business to discuss.
For example,a womans parking her car,
and then Jimmy runs out and saysshes run over his Rolex watch,
so then we show the watch.
Of course Jimmy will needa Rolex, I suppose.
I dont care, as longas we bury Candid Camera.
If youre trying to blendinto the wall, you cant.
Hello, Jimmy.
Hello, gorgeous.
What are you doingstanding here all alone?
Theyre talking business.
I fled.
Id better not.
Ive had too much already.
I insist.
The drunker you are,the funnier l become.
ABC did research.
Come on.Lets keep each other company.
I wish l was a mosquito right now.
I would never leave you alone.
Come to think of it,l never do, do I?
No, you dont.
Id want you on my arm.
Look at us, over here at the kids tabIe.
What do you mean?
Them. Your husband.
Ive been standing behind guyslike that my whoIe life.
I was lucky I was funny.
If I wasnt funny,I would never have gotten to meet you.
- Thats not true.- It is.
Its hard to believetheres anything better than you.
Hard to believe he could doany better than you .
Please stop.
What do you think happenedbetween the two of them?
Excuse me?
Oh, come on. Look at them.
I dont like what youre saying.
All I know is I know her,and you know him,
and there they are,and they dont care where we are.
Stop it.
- Hold on.- Let me go.
I dont like it any more than you do.
You people are ugly and crude.
What people? You mean comedians?
. . .a very unusual emergency.
You know what must really annoy him?
All the interruptionswhen were not at home--
signing for deliveries,answering the phone,
turning on the oven.
You know I never ask himto do that sort of thing
unless its impossiblefor me to be here.
How about that Thanksgiving
when your car broke downand Daddy had to leave his office
every 1 5 minutes to baste?
Your father never complains or anything.
WelI, no. Daddy wouldnt.
I guess he wouIdnt.
Leaving so soon?
We didnt get to talk.
Bettys not feeling well.
Too bad.
Here, let me get that.
Its the least I can do.
Thanks to you,I got everything I wanted.
I dont know if thats possible, Jimmy.
I got my relationship with Utz,
my show, my money, 39 on the air.
Im gonna be an institution.
Ill tell everyone I know.
You know what I like about you?Nothing.
But its okay.
You got me everything I wanted.
What did you get?
Bobbie?
Lots of people have had that.
Excuse me?
Please. I laugh at you.
I go home at night, and I laugh at you.
I dont know what you think happened.
You. You want to step out, fine.
Go to a whore.
You dont screw another mans wife.
Youre garbage.
And you know it.
Well.
Good night, you two.
Its been a gas.
