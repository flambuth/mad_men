MEREDITH: Good morning.

I wont have you lost again.
I wasnt lost, I was late.I was fibbing.
Well, you cant do that.It throws off a very busy schedule.
And not to mention everything,et cetera.
Can you call housekeeping and ask them notto make up my bed while Im still in it?
Well, you wont have toendure the hardships
of the Plaza much longer.
The floors of your apartmentwill be done Monday.
If you pick paint,you could move in next week.
Thats great.
(SIGHS)
Honey, you can just have thiswaiting on my desk.
Does it smell any betterin here?
- If you like Air Wick and fruit.- Mmm.
When I was packing,
well, I think these were bestkept from the movers.
Have you thought about new furniture?
I think it looks great in here.
No, for your apartment.You only have a bed.
I made dinner reservationsin Farmington tomorrow.

Oh! Thank you.

Im not going to let you spoilthe moment. My moment.
See you in the funny papers.
I dont know whats keepingthe building representatives,

Forging my signature?
No, thats okay. You can go.
Well, this is my last dayand I wanted to thank you.
Bullshit. They cant fire you.
Actually, I took another job.

Look, I hate Caroline, too.
No, its...
- Did I do something?- No.
Its just I kept thinkingabout walking into a new office.
Yeah. Im doing it, too.
And now theres gonna beone less person I know.
Mr. Sterling, its not you.
Advertising is not a verycomfortable place for everyone.
Oh.
That in mind,I have to say thank you.
Youre very amusing.

Hello, neighbor.

We also did the pillfor Ortho...
If its in it, near it or makesyou think about it, were on it.
(CHUCKLES)
So, Topaz Pantyhose and ButlerShoes set off an alarm.
But we really love Avon.
This is incredible.
So you just came in hereto get on my business.
And to say hello.
Well, Im flattered by both.
If you want us,just ask Frank in the studio.
Hell ask Bobby in traffic,
and hell tell Carl,the associate creative director.
You can put a request in however you want.
Well let the Sovietsdeal with it.
Youre aware that Peggy Olsonhandles all of those accounts?
See, I told you.
Well, wed love to sharethe crumbs with her.
Thank you so much for the plant.
Oh, were going tothe Oyster Bar tonight.
We have an informalladies club.
Its not womens lib,just a bitch session.
We are strictlyconsciousness lowering.
(CHUCKLES) When I get settled in.
(PEGGY SIGHS)
Incredible.
Did you come to get your furniture?
There was a mix-up.My office isnt ready.
Why are you still here?
Well, Im not going to McCann.And so far Im not going anywhere.
And Im being paidthrough the end of the week,
so I thought Id makesome long-distance phone calls.
Oh.
We lost Dow.
We still owe them work.
Could you get Mr. Kreutzerat Sugarberry Ham for me?
Why would I do that?
Because Marshassorting things out over there
and Im not calling myself.
Im giving youa standing ovation.
How was the Bahamas?
Oh, its everythingwe say it is in print.
(CLEARS THROAT)
I hope youre findingeverything satisfactory.
Fergs beenan excellent tour guide.
Hes just following you aroundbecause hes our resident impressionist.
Do an imitation of Don yet?
(IN DEEP VOICE)"Im, um, working very diligently
"on the, um, matter at hand."
(JIM LAUGHS)
Well, you better not make a jokeof this man.
Weve lined up coffeeand baloney with Nabisco,
National Cash Register,
and your old friendConrad Hilton.
- He bought you a gift.- (CHUCKLES)
Thats never good.
And we just bought an entire agencyin Milwaukee to get Miller Beer.
For me?
When I want something, I get it.
And Ive been trying to get youfor 10 years.
Youre my white whale, Don.
Well, maybe you should send meto the Bahamas.
In due time.
The important thing iswere expecting you

Jim, I dont know what to tell ya.Ill do my best.
And, Don, this is a shirtsleevesoperation. We want you relaxed.
And should you everneed anything in this city,

Oh, Miller Beer is coming in tomorrow

For ladies?
For menwatching their waistlines.
Why dont we call it "Tub"?
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
Have you said it yet?
What?
Have you introduced yourself?
Im Don Draperfrom McCann Erickson.
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
BARRY ON INTERCOM: I appreciate the call.
Mostly because its hardfor me to walk around here
acting like nothings changed.
Only some things have changed.
Avon will be servicedby the exact same personnel.
Creative handled byTed Chaough and Peggy Olson.
Forget about personnel.
Every dollar you spend
will now get you five timesthe audience.
And once we get you on (CHUCKLES)
Well, we already are on TV.
We know that.What Dennis is saying is...
You know, Im in Atlanta all the time.
How about a trip to Augusta,play a few holes?
You any good?
No.
No, Im not.
Listen, my girl is telling me thatits time for our staff meeting.
- Thanks again for the call.- Of course.
Such a pleasure, Barry.
Bye.
Whos next?
I dont know what to sayexcept Barry is in a wheelchair.
What?
I told you that...
and I wrote it down.
Oh, I thoughtthat was Charlie Butler...
from the shoes.
No, its not.
And its Charles Butlerand its footwear.
(SIGHS) I cant believe you.
Its an honest mistake.
You heard him say he was"walking around the office."
Its an expression.
Which he shouldnt beable to use.
I stayed up all nightpreparing those briefs.
Mr. Donnelly said youd be onthe call to help with the transition,
but you seem like you dont even careabout keeping these accounts.
Im sorry. Who told youyou got to get pissed off?
All I ask is thatyou please read the brief
before our next call.
You know what?
Do it yourself.
I thought you were gonna be fun.

MARSHA: Im sorry to drop by.
Oh, Marsha. Thats so sweet of you.
You didnt have to come up here.Its not your fault.
Those are actually from McCann.
An apology. Thats classy.
How do I explain this?
All the SC&P girls got flowers.
Its still classy.
Well, all the new secretaries.
They thought I was a secretary?
Did you tell Don what happened?
- Do you want me to?- No.
- Maybe I should call Joan.- Thats not her job there.
- I know that, Marsha.- I am taking care of it.
As well as your mail and memos
regarding Peter PanPeanut Butter and Tampax.
What happened to all my things?
Theyre putting your boxes in storage.
You will have an office any minute.
In the meantime,you can work in the pool.
I am a copy supervisor.
I am not setting foot in thereuntil I have an office.
If they want me,they can reach me here.
At home?
No. No. Ill be at SC&P.
Hell, thats where my furniture is.
I will let them know.
JOAN: Could you hold that?
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
Good morning.
How are you, stranger?
Homesick.
- Well, takes some time to settle in.- I know.
- You should come by for a drink.- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
When am I going to do that?
Put me on your calendar.
We dont share any accounts.Youre too important.
Not for you.
Believe me,Id involve you if I could.
Its been a little bumpy.
I can still interfere.
No, Ill figure it out.
Of that I am certain.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
- Lets make a date for lunch.- Soon.
MEREDITH: Tell me if you like thegeneral idea so I can take a few risks.
Whered you learn to do this?
Im an army brat, remember?New base every year.
I want to live here.
Youre my decorator.Ill pay you in cash.
Nonsense. I love it.
Lunch in the executive boardroomwith Miller Beer.
They asked if roast beefwas okay.
Perfect.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Joan, nice to see you up here.
Are you coming to the Sears briefing?Thats a good idea.
No, I was actuallylooking for Mr. Donnelly,
but if now is a bad time...
Ferg.
Pete, its your meeting.You can start without me.
Im gonna put in a requestto get you involved with this.
Thank you.
Thats thoughtful.
So, what can I do for you?
Its just...
Regarding the Avon transition,
I thought maybePete could be an asset.
Petes a vice president.Whats wrong with Dennis?
I like Dennis personally.
Im not surethe client responded to him.
Say no more.Ill take care of it.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Hello?
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
Are those my boxes?
L gotta go.
L gotta gQ!
Yeah, I signed for them,
but I was wonderingwhat happened.
Ugh. Youve got to be kidding me.
You knowwere the only ones here.
Have you been on the phone all morning?
Stan called.He doesnt have a phone yet.
Hes on the 14th floor.Come by and say hi.
And
I prepared thisfor your approval.
PEGGY: What is this?
ED: Do you think "quagmire"should be plural?
(SIGHS) We cant do this.
Theyre never going tolook at it.
Ed, you could easily end up
working for Dow againor Ken Cosgrove.
You could even end up working for me.
Thats not very subtle.
I asked you to do one damn thingand you didnt even do it.
Fine. I quit.
(CHUCKLES)
Well, thanks for everything.
When you get settled in over there,which will happen,
give me a call.
I promise.
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
Im sorry. Its Bob, right?
Yes. Don, good to see you.
Weve got the best box lunch around.
It should have your name on it.
Is this the Miller Beer meeting?
It certainly is.Bill Phillips, Conley Research.
Don Draper and Ted Chaough.
- A pleasure.- Shall we?
Is this every creative directorin the agency?
Its only half of us.
So, are you hereto "bring us up a notch," too?
(CHUCKLES) So they tell me.
BOB: Good morning, gentlemen.
As you know, this is Bill Phillips,senior director at Conley Research.
Bill, why dont you tell us a little bitabout this exciting new beverage.
Despite that pile of factsand figures in front of you,
I dont look at thisas a presentation of research.
To me, this is an opportunityto stimulate
some of our industrysfinest imaginations.
Im going to describe a man toyou of very specific qualities.
He lives in Wisconsin,Michigan, Ohio.
Some call it "the Heartland."
Some call it "the beer belt."
He has some college.
Makes a good living,
but it doesnt feel like itbecause he works long hours.
He has a lawn mower.
Wants a hammock.
Bunch of power tools inthe garage that he never uses.
He loves sportsbecause he used to play them.
And he loves dogsbecause they dont talk.
(ALL LAUGHING)
We all know this man
because there aremillions of him
and he drinks beer.
Not just any beer.
No, it has to be his brand.
And what is his brand?
The one he drank in college?
The one his dad drank?
The one that comesin the best bottle, can, tap?
It doesnt matterbecause thats it,
and its not openfor discussion.
Now, you all knowthat thats not true...
but how do you get himto open his mind?
Better have something more,
or in this case...
less.
And thats tricky.
When we talk abouta low-calorie beer...
we immediately become feminine.
- Its the word "calorie."- (DOOR CLOSES)
It makes you thinkof a reducing plan.
A note on the fridgeto remind her about her diet.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Your girl still at lunch?
Beverly always takesthe whole hour. I insist.
I have a little news for you.
Oh, I hopeI didnt cause any trouble.
Too early for you?
No, of course not.
So, I spoke with Dennis.
I hope I didntruffle any feathers.
Well, heres how it looks.
Like some junior account mancame in
and started swinging her elbows.
He didnt read the brief...
and Im not Dennis junior.
Joan, see it from his side.
He has a wife and three children.Hes not going to work for a girl.
Whats he gonna say to a client?
"Shes my boss"?
It happens all the time now.
Peggy Olson was our copy chief.
Its different with a bunch ofwriters fresh out of Columbia.
And honestly, I doubt thatsgonna continue here anyway.
I see.
Joan, I didnt come down hereto upset you.
I agree that the best wayto keep the business
is to keep your statuson your accounts.
Oh.
And youll certainly getthe respect you desire
now its just you and me.
You dont have to do that,but I accept.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Mmm. Good.
Now, first thing we have to dois pay this guy a visit.
- Who?- Barry from Avon.
We owe him an apology.
And lets face it, it wouldbe good to get out of town,
even if its to Atlanta.
I appreciate that,but I dont want to put you out.
Look, I know a good jobwhen I see one.
No, its just thatmight be too much.
Hell be in New York soon
and Avon corporateis blocks away.
Hey, Im easy.
Im not expecting anything morethan a good time.
Excuse me?
I mean, I want to getto know you, of course.
Of course.
Good.
My first act of benevolence,you can call Charles Butler on your own.
Well take him to lunchnext week.
Thank you.
From now on, no one comesbetween me and your business.
I appreciate that.
We cant lose those accounts.What would you do around here?
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Loretta!
Here she is.
Sally left?
Yes. She got a ridewith her friend.
And no one thought to call me, I guess.
- Do you want something to drink?- No.
They left after lunch.
I told her to call your office.
Your secretary is a moron.
I was out of the office.I wanted to get the car washed.
She comes and goesas she pleases.
And we cant get mad at herfor being independent.
Its normal.
- Is that what Freud says?- (CHUCKLES)
So far I havent come acrossanyone normal.
You Okay?
I carried $100 worthof textbooks yesterday
during registration.
- Maybe youre getting old.- (LAUGHS)
Im younger than you.
Always have been,always will be.
Maybe you could find some nicefreshman to carry your books.
Thats fine.
When do the boys get home?
Genes at Cub Scoutsand Bobbys got baseball.
They wont be back until 6:30.
Ill let you get backto your studies.
Ive always wanted to do this.
Knock em dead, Birdie.
Bye.
(WINCES)
Shit.
(SIGNAL SWITCH CLICKS)
Your stomach is grumbling.
(CHUCKLING) You never let me eat.
I can make fried chicken.
I dont mind playing the house,
but as long as your motherand Kevin are away,
why dont you call in sick?
Let me take you to Bermuda.
No.
Cape Cod?
I dont wanna go anywhereI dont want to go.
Dont make plans for me.
All right. All right.
I have a lot of work.
Look, I know I told younot to complain,
but that doesnt meanI dont want to hear about it.
But you really dont.
- What happened?- (SIGHS)
Its a big place, and I askedthe wrong person for help.
And I dont thinkI can get out of it.
Well, if you dont like that job,you dont have to do it.
You got enough, and you got me.
They still owe meover half a million dollars.
Im not walking away from that.
So, this is a business problem.
Now, I can help.
Youre already helping.
Theres two waysI deal with disagreeable people.
One, you can call a lawyer,throw a bunch of paper at them,
tie them up in court,cost them some money.
Nobody wins,
but it loosens the earth.
Whats the second?
You can call a guy.
"A
Im a developer.Men get stubborn.
What does "a guy" do?
You get the right guy,all they have to do is show up.
Youve really done that?
You seem to like it,so Im gonna say yes.
Youre disturbed.
Doesnt seem likesuch a big problem now, does it?
(ON RADIO)I dont want to say goodbye for the summer
MAN ON RADIO:Beautiful night out there tonight.
In downtown Cleveland,we have a high of 75, low of 62.

and it should staythat way through the weekend.
I dont know about you,
but I am not readyto say goodbye to the summer.
But not true of the folksat Higbees Department Store
where theyre ready to provideall the back-to-school fashions.
Im really tired, arent I?
Youve been driving for sevenhours in the wrong direction.
Where are you going?
Racine, Wisconsin.Ever been there?
No. Whats in Racine?
Maybe some waitresswho doesnt care about you?
You shouldnt do that.
Thats not gonna stop me.
You like to play the stranger.
Remember On the Road?
Ive never read that book,you know that.
Im riding the rails.
"Whither goest thou, America,

- Hello?- MARS HA: Peggy?
Yes. Who is this?
Its Marsha.
I thought I would try thisbefore I ran over.
Your phones dead.
What do you want?
Well, on behalf of McCann Erickson,
I want to welcome youto your new office.
When can you come over?
- Well, I guess right now.- Wonderful.
Can you work at a drafting table
till they bring your things overtomorrow?
Yes. Thank you.
(ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Hello?
Is someone there?
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
- Roger.- Oh, Christ!
I have a heart condition, you know.
Believe it or not, Im not scary.Organ music is scary.
What are you doing here?
I told Caroline I wantedto pack my personal things,
which I will eventually do
as soon as I figure out why shethought my bar wasnt personal.
Did you try Dons office?
All I found was lighter fluid.Im not there yet.
Mines gone.
I dont want to go to a bar.I did that yesterday.
Listen, sweetheart, if you dont mind...
Im not running an errand.I have to go to McCann.
Three days ago.
They screwed up my office, it...
it doesnt matter.Theyre finally ready.
Id do it for you.
Would you drink vermouth?
Yes, Im afraid I would.
Ill be along in a minute.
Oh, Mr. Hobart. Can I help you?
Youre sitting in his chair.Youre obviously not expecting him.
I told Daphne I dont knowwhen hell be in.
Can I take a message?
Sure.
Tell him he missed Nabisco
and National Cash Registerjust left,
so he might as welltake the rest of the day off.
Thank you. Ill let him know.
Is he on a bender, sweetheart?
I havent heard from him,
but he went to take his daughterto school.
Im not concerned.
Look at this."Christmas Day, 1951
Whos Roberta?
I dont know.
On! (CHUCKLES)
Roberta.
We had our drink.
You clearly dont need help.You need an audience.
McCann made you wait.You can make them wait.
Im not enjoying this.
Oh, my God. What is this?
Its an octopuspleasuring a lady.
It was Coopers.Was in his office forever.
You can have it.
You can put it in your office.
No. They wont take meseriously.
Thats pretty serious.Its 150 years old.
You know I need tomake men feel at ease.
Who told you that?
So now I gave you something,you can sit tight and keep me company.
You think youre gonnahave fun like this over there?
This is more attentionthan Ive ever gotten from you.
You should see the floor Im on.Its a nursing home.
What the hell happened?
Youre acting likeyou had nothing to do with this.
Ill have you know,I held this place together.
I know you think that,but you actually sold it.
You were supposed towatch out for us.
This businessdoesnt have feelings.
You get bought, you get sold,you get fired.
If the account moves, you move.
Even if your names on the damn door,
you should know better than toget attached to some walls.
Well, hopefully Ill havethat problem someday.
Okay, hot stuff.
Its exciting.
I mean, I knowits going to be challenging...
but I needed that.
So do you.
In the summer of 44,
it was over 100 degreesevery day in the Pacific,
so we dropped anchor in theUlithi Lagoon to go for a swim.
And you can imagine the men.It was bedlam.
But I couldnt do it.
Cant you swim?
Did I mention I was in the Navy?
No, the real problem was
it was a two-story dropoff our cruiser.
We all have regrets.
No, I did it.
I just needed a push.
This was a hell of a boat, you know.
Come on.
It just looks good now,
but it was miserablewhen you were in it.
Trust me.
Is that really how youregonna remember this place?
No.
Good.
This is the one for the road,okay?
You gonna show up drunkat 4:00 on your first day?

Yes? Can I help you?
Im looking for Mrs. Baur.
Im Mrs. Baur.
Good evening. I hopeIm not disturbing your dinner.
Not yet. My husbandwill be home any minute.
Well, I really just needto talk to you.
Im Bill Phillipsfrom Conley Research.
We represent an arrayof American companies,
including Miller Beer,
and out of over 900 entries,you, Diana Baur,
were chosen to win a brand-newWestinghouse refrigerator
full of Miller Beer.
- Oh.- (CHUCKLES)
Now, you have your choice,white or harvest gold.
Thats the fridge, not the beer,of course.
Well, that sounds wonderful...
but Im not Diana, Im Laura.
Can I still accept it?
I dont know.Im supposed to speak to Diana.
Is your mother home?
You really shouldspeak to my husband.
Shes his ex-wife.
I guess if he knows whereshe is, I could come back...
or wait in the car.
My neighbors have seen youon the porch long enough.
Come on inside.
Have a seat.Would you like some iced tea?
- I dont wanna be a bother.- Its no bother.
I have to check on the chicken.
Are you looking for my mother?
Diana is your mother?
If she won something,I should get it.
Yes, that makes sense.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It was no problem at all.
I hope youre findingeverything satisfactory.
Well, Im herebecause I need your help.
Im at your disposal.
I dont know how to put this,
but I dont feel thatmy accounts
are gettingthe right kind of attention.
Our accounts.
Well, thats just it.
I fully expectto service clients
with the help of your personnel.
But as a partner at SC&P,
I had a certain amountof status.
You know, more independence.
Whats the problem?
You can speak freely.
Well, I dont think thatFerg Donnelly is a good match.
Fergs very importantaround here.
Frankly, youre lucky hes takenan interest in your business.
I understand that,but its not necessary.
I dont mean to brag, but Ive beenhandling this account on my own
since I brought it in
Im sure thats true,
but youre gonna have toget used to
doing things the way we do them.
Well, I dont know how to say this,but I cant work with him.
Joan, it may not have sunk in,but your status has changed.
Avon, Butler Footwear,Topaz Pantyhose,
I guess you dont needthose accounts.
(SIGHS)
Ive tried to be patient...
but I dont care aboutyour SC&P partnership.
I dont know if somebodyleft it to you in their will,
but your little stakedoesnt mean anything here.
Is that what you want?
Because Im perfectly happy to take
my half a million dollarsand be on my way.
Ill bet people always sayyoure the kind of gal
who doesnt take nofor an answer.
But no...
youre not telling mehow to run my business.
Now, find a way to get along...
or you can expect a letterfrom our lawyer.
I wonder how many womenaround here
would like to speak to a lawyer.
I think the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission has one.
Women love it here.
You want to threaten us?
Youll be all alone.
No.
I think the second I file a complaint,Ill have the ACLU in my office
and Betty Friedan in the lobby
with half the womenwho marched down Fifth Avenue.
I guess you didnt seethe headlines
about what happenedat Ladies Home Journal.
Or Newsweek.
Do you have any idea
how much space McCann buys
in The New York Timesevery year?
We could get them to printMein Kampf on the front page.
Yes, Im sure Ill find it difficultto find a reporter
who wants to embarrass youthis deeply.
Look,
youre unhappy,
and now Im unhappy.
So, how about this?
Im willing to give you50 cents on the dollar...
to never see your face again.
I guess I wasnt clear.
Im not negotiating.
Then you should getout of my office immediately.
Go ahead.
Id rather give it to a lawyer.
So you get to drive all overAmerica giving people prizes?
That sounds like fun.
Well, I also give
- a lot of boring presentations.- (DOOR OPENING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
- Hello.- Hello, honey.
This is Bill Phillips.
He says Dianawon some kind of prize.
A refrigeratorfull of Miller Beer.
Really?
Well, theres been some confusion
because a Mrs. Diana Baurentered our contest,
and, well,shes nowhere to be found.
Diana never entered any contest.
Well, I guess its a mistake.
Yeah...
letting you in our house.
And my wife, she doesnt know any better,but I guess you knew that.
- Cliff, please.- Let him answer.
Who the heck are you?Or do I have to call the police?
(SIGHS)
Youre right.
Im deeply sorryfor the ruse, maam,
but I work fora collection agency.
Clearly youre not responsiblefor Mrs. Baur anymore,
but I need to knowher whereabouts.
Last I heard,she was in New York.
- Do you have an address?- No.
Thats all I got.
I apologize for the intrusion.
Guess were not as dumbas you think we are.
Im leaving.
The clothes, the shoes,the Caddy?
Youre no collection agent.
I am.
You think youre the first onethat came looking for her?
Shes a tornado...
just leaving a trail of brokenbodies behind her.
I didnt mean to disturb you.
Yeah, but you did.
Im just startingto get back on my feet.
Just starting to get back to evenpart of the way to where I was.
Look, Im sorry.
I was worried about her.
She seemed so lost.
I lost my daughter to Godand my wife to the devil.
I lost everything.
Is that what you wanted to know?
No.
You cant save her.
Only Jesus can.
Hell help you, too.
Ask Him.
- Look, L“- And dont come back.
Come on, once more from the top!
