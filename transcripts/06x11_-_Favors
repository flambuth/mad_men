Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Mr. Sterlings inside.
Do you want ice?
Coffee.
Its one thing to be near the bar. Its another thing to be under it.
Sunkist sent us a crate.
Ive seen blind people juggle, but somehow it seems to be beyond me.
Just close your eyes. Thats what you did in the meeting.
Whatever I did, it worked. Were in it.
Thats good news.
Step one, I send it to research.
Step two, youll need to get that little idea factory working.
Theres only one angle-
an orange... thats orange on TV.
I thought they were pretty clear theyre too cheap to get out of print.
So talk em out of it or into it.
Id love to, but I think it demands a media strategy.
Forget research. Put Harry Crane on it.
Look at you.
See? Not all surprises are bad.
The ants, they look like people.
He should be right out. Is there anything I can get you?
- I think she would like a cup of tea. - In a teacup.
Id be more excited if we didnt have to go in Teds plane to present.
- Hello, Mother. - Hello, Peter.
Manolo, may I speak with you a moment?
Of course, Mr. Campbell. Your tea is coming.
Ill be fine. Im not a child.
Peggy, would you mind?
Mrs. Campbell, nice to meet you.
Theres no reason for you to be so formal, dear.
Sit with me.
How are you today?
I cant tell you how much it relieves me to see you and Peter reunited.
Well, it was really a by-product of the merger.
Im glad you both swallowed your pride, if nothing else...
but for the good of the child you have together.
Excuse me?
Oh, Ive embarrassed you.
Your son and I are not together that way.
Trudy, dear, dont deny him.
Dont reject his caresses.
Mrs. Campbell-
I hope you two can someday find...
what Manolo and I have found.
I waited long enough...
to experience the physical satisfactions of love.
Did she go to China for that tea?
Thank you for driving her out to Buds.
Ive paid you for the extra day.
I know that you dont drive.
Well, I do, but not to her satisfaction.
Bob Benson was right about you. Youre worth every penny.
Bob is a wonderful salesman.
Still, I want you to have a little something off the books.
Mr. Campbell, I refuse.
Its important to me that you treat my mother well...
but also that you treat yourself.
- The pleasure is all mine. - I know that isnt true.
Sally, get in here.
Hello.
What?
Julies mother called and told me you were the only two girls on the trip.
So?
Youre not staying in a Midtown hotel with all those boys.
Miss OSheas gonna be there.
Shes 25.
Whats the point of having a mansion...
if youre gonna spend all your time in here?
Fine, I wont do the Model UN. It was his idea.
Fine, youre not going.
- Cant we stay with Daddy? - You mean with no one.
You hate that Daddy supports my dreams.
He doesnt think Im just a pain in the ass.
Your father is a hero.
Like everything else in this country...
Diplomacy Clubs just another excuse to make out.
I thought she should join the Student Congress. The UNs a joke.
- Oh, youre home. - Whos this?
This is Mitchell- Sylvia and Arnolds son.
Nice to finally meet you, Mitchell. Im Don.
Thanks again, Megan.
What did he want?
Um-
Im sworn to secrecy, but hes in a lot of trouble.
What happened?
Hes 1-A.
But hes in school.
He sent back his draft card in protest. They reclassified him.
What did he think was gonna happen? Stupid kid.
Don, he knows he screwed up. He wants to run.
You know, to Canada.
I suppose I could call my brother-in-law, but I cant do that to Sylvia and Arnold.
- Can I? - Just leave it alone.
- Hes so scared. - He should be.
He cant spend the rest of his life on the run.
I know how you feel...
but you dont want him to go to Vietnam.
Megan, its not our problem.
Could you get me another whiskey sour?
Sure.
Maybe Ill switch to whiskey sours.
How about a Shirley Temple then?
I dont think Dramamine and booze go together.
I dont think Dramamine and cranberry juice go together either.
But I thought wed be back on your little plane...
not having a romantic dinner.
- Dont you want to celebrate? - I want to live, Ted.
What?
He doesnt like flying.
Well, youve seen how simple it is now. Theres nothing to be afraid of.
My father died in a plane crash.
Oh, Im sorry to hear that.
Was he a pilot?
Ha! No.
A passenger.
Look, youre driving. Can we please, please have another round?
You still have to get home from White Plains.
Ill hail a cab.
Hes such a New Yorker.
This is the agency I always wanted.
Ambition, brains, and beauty.
Yeah, but what about him?
Im gonna cut you off too, my dear.
I should call home.
If the check comes, Im sending it to Ocean Spray.
Can you imagine what it does to his wife every time he takes that plane?
I guess so.
You dont want me to talk about his wife.
You dont know what youre talking about.
But I do. Ive seen that look.
I know, but-
nothing can happen.
And hes in love with you too.
Youre the one whos in love with him.
Well, I could use an account, and hes been generous.
At least one of us ended up important.
Please tell me you dont pity me.
I dont.
Because you really know me.
I do.
I should tell you...
I had a very strange conversation with your mother.
Theres no other kind.
Well, it doesnt matter.
What did she say?
I think she thought I was your wife...
and Manuel was her husband.
My father never treated her that well.
Maybe thats it. She thinks shes in love with him.
I could see it. Manolo is very charming.
I dont think you understand.
She thinks shes... making love with him.
Tell me exactly what she said.
Did your father ever give her spa treatments...
that released a "fire in her loins"?
Oh!
Oh, I think Im gonna be sick.
Im sorry. I shouldnt have told you.
But I cant get the image out of my head.
Stop it, please.
I dont even want to think about her brushing her teeth.
I thought I cut you two off.
Ted, I have never been less afraid of flying in my life.
What? What does he mean?
Nothing.
Well, I should get the check.
Honey, whos that gonna be?
- Arnold. - Is it too late?
For what? Come in.
Look, I would have called, but Sylvia is-
Listen, about this afternoon-
Oh, hello, Arnold.
Im sorry about my kid dropping in on you.
I didnt know if I should tell you.
Well, he figured you would...
and I dont want you in the middle of this.
His mothers treating it like hes dying. She doesnt want anyone to know.
Do you want a drink?
Sit up here drinking while theyre down there slamming the doors?
And you lied to me.
Been meaning to knock on your door anyway.
You know, catch a game or something.
I get baseball tickets. Mostly the Mets.
Well, then Im glad you didnt.
You know, I didnt even know he left school.
Sylvia says she didnt know either.
Shes doing that a lot lately- lying about little things.
Could tell somethings been wrong all year.
- Another Manhattan? - Nah. No.
Should have never let him go to Paris.
He got there right in the middle of the riots.
His French is excellent.
I think he got a lot of girls as an expatriate revolutionary.
Could k*ll him right now.
There has to be a way.
Oh, believe me, everybodys an expert on it.
Sylvias father was suddenly Clarence Darrow.
Its thrilling to see a plumber interpret international law.
Youre one of the top surgeons in the country.
You must know somebody.
I know a lot of people, but it doesnt matter.
It doesnt matter if he goes back to school.
Hes 1-A. His induction could be tomorrow.
Hes on a damn list for the rest of his life.
On some level, you have to admire his idealism.
You sound like Sylvia.
But she doesnt really buy his bullshit.
You think shes gonna let her baby rot in jail for a cause?
I dont know what to do.
What would you do?
If it was my kid, or if it was me?
You were in the service, right?
I was.
You see action?
It was very different.
I wanted to go.
And then when I got there, well-
Thats the trick.
Kids 18, 19 years old, they have no sense of their own mortality.
Or anyone elses.
Thats why they make good soldiers.
Well, the army paid for med school.
I served in a hospital in Pusan.
We were very lucky.
Lucky enough to live in this country.
And service is part of that bargain- sacrifice.
We knew that.
The w*r is wrong.
Ill tell you right now, if anyone was ever gonna get it, its gonna be him.
Hes soft.
Im sure hes a good kid.
The best.
Cold pills and capsules take a while, dont they?
Dristan Mist can unlock sinus blockage.
What you watching?
I dont know.
Whats the matter? I called.
I didnt want to get into it when youre about to fly...
but you were supposed to have dinner with us.
I made a mistake. Well do it tomorrow.
You dont have to make a federal case out of it.
Why dont you get a legal pad and write down...
a bunch of excuses for the next week?
Because none of them mean anything to the boys.
What about food, clothing and shelter? Does that mean anything?
Remember what the minister said at Franks funeral?
"God can turn off the lights at any moment."
You know where youre gonna be? The office.
This is temporary.
I just have to do this until-
Until what?
Until you... are back where you were at the old firm?
Because things werent so great then either.
So weve moved on from Im working too much to something else.
The problem is, even when you do come home, youre not here.
Youre obsessed.
And I can feel how disappointing this all is compared to your battles at work.
Im not enjoying that.
How did we get to the point where you think I dont want you to enjoy things?
I know you like having a young copywriter in your airplane.
Come on, Pete was there too.
And I know you like facing Don Draper every morning more than the clients.
How was your day?
I just wish you liked being here more.
Could you get Mr. Campbell?
Do you want to see him before the status meeting?
- Whens that? - Now.
And I also need to know if youre attending the Chevrolet dinner.
- Whens that? - Tonight.
- Morning. - May I speak with you?
Does your friend still work at the Department of Defense?
No, he left for Union Carbide.
But he probably still has pull over there.
What happened now?
You must know plenty of people with kids getting deferments.
How are they doing that?
They go to college. Divinity school. Medical baloney.
No, its too late for that. I need someone who can really pull strings.
Well, arent you having dinner with General Motors...
one of the largest defense contractors in the world?
What are the politics of that?
I dont know, Don. Im not on Chevy.
Shall we?
Thats not my fault.
Dont worry. If I had Chevy...
I wouldnt be able to devote my full attention to Ocean Spray.
- Cranberries? - Cranberry Cocktail.
And they like us so much, they might even give us the blends.
- What about Sunkist? - What about it?
Its orange juice.
Morning, everyone.
- Did you know about Sunkist? - What about it?
Don told Harry to put together a media plan right away.
Why didnt you tell us about that?
Isnt this the meeting where I tell you?
Are we having this meeting?
Why didnt you tell us you were presenting to Ocean Spray?
Theres been a series of memos.
Didnt you wonder where everybody was?
- We cant present to both. - Which one is bigger?
Theyre about the same. Three million.
Weve already spent $5,000 on Ocean Spray.
What about our trip to California?
Was it $5,000?
I have a lot of receipts. I havent figured it out yet.
Why dont you join this company and read a memo once in a while?
Maybe theyre not a conflict.
We dont have either yet.
I really didnt know.
I warned you about the memos, Ted.
The more you send, the less they get read.
Imagine if every time Ginger Rogers jumped in the air...
Fred Astaire punched her in the face.
Why are you taking this to heart?
Because its directed at me. Can you not see that?
So what? You know well end up with just one juice.
I dont want his juice. I want my juice.
Its all your juice.
Tell him that.
Michigans in the Big Ten.
Ron Kutchinski just ran the fastest half mile in the world.
- Hes going to the Olympics. - Youre selling yourself short.
Im telling you, they would be lucky to have you.
I got it.
Look at this. Got a couple of high fashion models.
Arent you a gentleman?
- Hey. - Hello.
Youse two dont know each other.
These are my two favorite people. Mitchell Rosen, 16A...
Id like you to meet Sally Draper, 17B and all points north.
Im Julie. Im crashing at Sallys.
Cool.
They were supposed to leave a key for me. I lost mine.
Nobody said nothin to me, but that dont mean nothin.
We were going to go out for dinner tonight. Whats good around here?
His mothers cooking.
Around here, its just old people.
Are you a musician?
Cause you look like one.
Who?
I dont see it. Ill let you in.
- Oh, good day to you, Mrs. Rosen. - Hello.
- Mitchell, did you get a cab? - I was waiting for you.
Youre unbelievable.
I got it, Mrs. Rosen. Do you know Sally and, um-
Im Julie.
Im sorry, girls. Were in a bit of a rush.
Ill get your cab lickety-split.
Bring them right back.
Youre living with Mark Lindsay.
I dont live here.
What are you doing here? I said Id meet you at La Grenouille.
Dorothy, you must let me manage your calendar.
Im not standing in the hallway.
Come in.
You get ready, Mr. Campbell. Ill entertain her.
Actually, Manolo, Id like my mother to myself this evening.
Very well. Good night, my sweet.
Must he?
He has other plans, Mother.
Yes, Dorothy. Ill be there when you wake.
- Can I fix you something? - No.
Manolo doesnt like me to drink.
He likes me sharp.
Its so nice the way he looks after you.
Oh, Peter, hes a gift to me.
I just wanted to make sure youre aware hes your nurse.
You are prone to moments of confusion.
I suppose theres a way I could mistake your tone for concern.
Oh, I am concerned that you have-
how do I put this?-
misconstrued Manolos attention for affection.
If were going to have an adult conversation...
lets have an adult conversation.
Has he taken advantage of you?
Manny has awakened a part of me that was long dormant.
Dont you think Im entitled to the pleasures of love?
Do not be more specific.
Since when is it any of your business what goes on in my bedroom?
I am afraid that we are going to have to let him go.
Oh, no. What did he do?
Hes a pervert.
You were a sour little boy.
And youre a sour little man.
How could I expect you to be understanding?
Youve always been unlovable.
Now Ive lost my appetite. Im leaving.
Youll never find your way home.
I have carfare...
and a piece of paper with my address...
written in his elegant handwriting.
Mother.
Cheesecake? Chocolate cake?
- Two of everything. - And another round.
- Why not? - Oh, I can never get enough of it.
Growing up in Cleveland, my dad would take me right on Lake Erie.
But the waters gone bad now.
You should go to Florida.
Saltwater. Down off the Keys, where the marlin run.
Write your own Hemingway story.
If you dont catch anything, you have to blow your brains out.
So, Ross, where do you take your kid fishing?
I just got the two girls, and they could never keep their mouths shut.
But my grandsons just like me.
Last summer, we went up to Muskoka. Ontario.
Jesus, now we gotta hear about this kid again.
Brendans at Antioch.
Yep, studying the classics.
But I hope hell come to his senses.
Hes got a couple of years before he has decisions to make.
Well, as long as were working together, hes got a job with us.
Friend of mines kid just got to that point.
He doesnt have a lot of choices left. 1-A. Can you imagine?
Well, my heart goes out to him...
but thats just one of those problems that cant be solved.
Yeah.
Ive got two sons.
Thank God theyre too young.
I dont even like to think about that.
I know.
My friend is just beside himself.
I mean, people are doing things though.
Believe me, we know about that.
Makes me sick.
Well, next year this time, well have won the w*r.
Well take Brendan to dinner, get him plastered...
and have him read the menu in Latin.
Ted, are you an angler?
My hobby is coming up with names for the XP.
Last one.
Okay.
"Things I like about Mitchell."
- "His ass"? - Shh.
When did you see that?
I couldnt think of anything else.
What did you put?
"How he smiled at me."
"His shoulders."
"His red shirt."
You girls have a big day tomorrow.
And I can tell you right now, the next time this door opens, it wont be me.
- Lights out. - Good night, Mrs. Draper.
Why do you keep calling her that?
Cause she hates it.
Think about it. Hes right down there.
You should sneak down and kiss him.
He talked to you.
God, I wish I lived here.
- Yeah? - Did I wake you?
- Yeah. - Theres a rat in my apartment.
Told you to get traps.
Its in the trap, and its mortally wounded.
Im pretty sure, cause theres a lot of bl*od.
Did you call an ambulance?
You have to come over. It went under the couch.
I cant even look. What if its still alive?
What if I lift the couch and it starts flipping around?
Im not your boyfriend.
Maybe Ill make it worth your while if you come over.
No, you wont. Now good night.
- Youre not interested? - No.
Then why are you using your sexy voice?
Tuesday mornings great.
For what?
Oh. Why didnt you say so?
You can bring her.
Itll be dead by morning.
Eleanor Roosevelt.
I cant remember anything cause I didnt sleep.
Your floor smells like pee.
- No, it doesnt. - Do I smell like pee?
You smell like Prell.
Sally, youre not ready?
I let the guest shower first.
Well, I have to go to work.
But first I have to put you two in a cab, so shake a leg.


Oh, take out the trash.
I have to get ready.
Ill do it, Mrs. Draper.
Its Megan.
I would love to visit the studio sometime.
Well, hopefully Ill still have a job.
I have to make a phone call.
- Your agent? - Yes, actually.
Could you get me some coffee?
What the hell were you up to last night?
Mr. Draper?
Im fine, Dawn. You want some coffee?
What the hell were you thinking?
You said you werent going to be involved in Chevy until 1970.
So stay the hell out of it. Stop trying to poison my relationship.
Last time I checked, its our relationship.
And not everythings about you, Ted.
Then be better at it.
- What are you talking about? - You know this.
A client shouldnt have a single negative feeling in your presence.
Not the food, not the wine and certainly not the w*r.
I was just taking their temperature.
Why would you do that? Its Chevy, Don.
- Youd do it for your kid. - But its not your kid.
Oh, is it your kid?
No, its my friends kid.
Well, I bet you dont have a lot of friends, Don...
so Im going to assume this is important.
It is.
I just- I dont know what to do.
Do you know how young 19 is?
Did you ever think about talking to me instead of our most important client?
I dont know. Its GM.
Who else has that kind of clout in Washington?
Does he wear glasses?
I dont think so, but he could.
The guy who taught me to fly...
is a brigadier general in the Air National Guard.
Theyre always looking for exceptional young men to become pilots.
And youd be willing to call him?
Id consider it.
But first, youre going to have to stop the w*r.
I cant stop the w*r, Ted.
Dont be an assh*le, Don. The w*r youre waging on me.
You have to lower your w*apon.
What are you talking about?
Im talking about how we are going to get Ocean Spray.
So you need to stop chasing Sunkist.
Youre not going to compete with me like that anymore.
Were on the same damn side.
Thats it?
Dont act like its nothing.
It seems to be impossible so far.
Youd really do that?
Thank you.
This is not a handshake of gratitude. This is a binding contract.
Of course. Whatever you want.
Thats what I want.
Hold on. Whats the next step?
Tell the kid to write a letter about his childhood dream of being a pilot.
And it better be convincing. You should write it.
And tell him to get a haircut.
Be straight, Ted. What are the chances?
Im going to call right now.
Thank you.
Can you get Dr. Rosen on the phone?
Rosen residence.
Its me. Its Don.
What do you want?
Im trying to reach Arnold.
The office said he was home sick.
Its about Mitchell.
What? Tell me.
I know someone who knows someone in the Air National Guard.
Hes getting him a spot.
You told someone?
Its my partner.
Hes doing me a favor.
Did you fix it?
He just wants Mitchell to cut his hair and sign a letter.
And the two of you need to make sure he follows through.
Oh, hell follow through.
I bet.
My God, is it possible?
I think so, but we have to act fast.
They went upstate to the VA to call on an army buddy.
Ill send them up tonight.
Sylvia, sweetheart, its gonna be okay.
Are you there?
Yes.
Please, stop crying.
Oh. I feel better, but Ill feel better when I know its done.
Don.
Yes?
I cant believe you would do this for me.
You know I have children too.
I know thats not why youre doing it.
And I hope-
Well, I hope you know that I was just frustrated with you.
I do now.
I didnt want you to fall in love.
You didnt feel anything?
No, I just-
I dont want to go through this again.
You were good to me.
Better than I was to you.
Are we going to lunch? Because-
Get in here and close the door.
You have given me a terrible problem, and now youre going to fix it.
Is this about Sunkist? Because I did some digging-
I told you we needed a nurse, and you sent us a r*pist.
Manolo?
In fact, I never told you anything. You were just doing some digging.
Calm down. Sit down.
Bob.
She has the mind of a child. That man took advantage of her.
I assume she told you this story.
Dont you have your answer right there?
She says theyre in love...
and its the first time in months shes seemed sure of anything.
I dont think that Manolos interests turn that way.
Great, so hes a degenerate. That means hes capable of anything.
What exactly did she say?
Please, Im just trying to forget it.
Drink that.
- You feel better now? - I do.
Can I ask you something? Did she seem happy?
Yes. She did.
Is it really so impossible to imagine?
What?
Couldnt it be that if someone took care of you-
very good care of you-
if this person would do anything for you...
if your well-being was his only thought...
is it impossible that you might...
begin to feel something for him?
When theres true love, it doesnt matter who it is.
Tell him Ill give him a months pay.
And tell him its disgusting.
Of course.
The capital of the Philippines is Manila.
Its president is Ferdinand Marcos.
Its national language is Tagalog...
but many of its inhabitants speak Spanish due to its colonial past.
And their national product is-
I dont know. Manila envelopes?
- You dont know anything. - So?
How about this? All the boys are going to think youre dumb.
Dont tell me how to get boys.
You went to second base twice.
Thats a lot more than you.
- So if I were you, Id be scared. - Of what?
Of what youre going to do when Mitchell asks you to go all the way.
He doesnt even know Im alive.
Oh, I took care of that.
What did you do?
- I introduced you. - I introduced myself.
No, I took the letter, and I signed your name.
- What? - And I slid it under the back door.
Ow! That really hurts.
How could you do that? Now I can never go back.
You know youre going to thank me.
Just because your shift is over...
doesnt mean you can get undressed in the lobby.
- Incredible. - What?
He should greet you. How you doing today?
Im- I got- I left something.
And I dont have my key.
You mean you lost it already?
Can I have the keys, please?
Yeah. Okay.
Go fast.
Oh, what have we got here?
Couple of high fashion models?
Oh, God.
- Sally. - Oh, God.
Oh, dear God.
Dear God, what have we done?
Sally!
Sally!
Sally!
Did Sally just come through here?
Mr. Draper, I didnt know you was home.
She hopped in a cab just now. Ill go get her.
You okay?
Yes.
Did something happen?
I know she lost her keys. I gave her the keys. Its my fault.
Mr. Draper?
Dont you ever work through channels?
- Who blew the whistle? Brent? - Loud and clear.
Governor, Ive tried to work with local intelligence from the beginning.
Brent threw me out. Now, why?
Because its big. Thats why.
Weve had big ones before, but, this time, all I get is smoke.
Why didnt you tell me?
McGarrett, this is an important state.
Its our nations extended finger into the Pacific-
the ocean where two-thirds-
two of the three billion persons on earth meet and touch.
Hello?
Oh, Im glad youre home.
Let me get you a plate.
Oh, wow.
I had a client- meeting. Lunch.
- Sit down. - Im, uh-
Im gonna lie down.
You need to get some food in you. Sit down.
Do you want me to cut you a piece?
No.
I got it.
Hello.
Im sorry to bother you.
Don, Arnold and Mitchell are here.
- I dont feel well. - Stop.
Hello, Mitchell.
Im sorry to interrupt your dinner, but we just got back...
and Mitchell has something he wants to say.
Mr. Draper.
Thank you very much.
Well see if it works.
What?
He didnt tell you?
Don talked to somebody for us.
Really?
Sylvia sends her gratitude. She is overwhelmed.
Do you want something to eat? We should celebrate.
One step at a time.
Anyway, Don...
I owe you.
Lets go.
No, you eat. I got it.
You are the sweetest man.
You make me sick!
Sally, come back here!
What happened?
I dont know.
- Im gonna go talk to her. - No. Ill talk to her.
She has a crush on Mitchell.
Oh.
Sally.
- Open the door. - No.
You dont get to talk to me anymore.
Sally?
Sally, open the door. I need to talk to you.
I know you think you saw something.
I was... comforting Mrs. Rosen.
She was very upset.
Its very...
complicated.
Sally, can you hear me?
Yes.
Did you hear what I said?
Okay.
