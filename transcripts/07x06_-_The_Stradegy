Im sorry to bother you,
but were the peoplewho paid for your meal,
and as much as I am committedto you enjoying your food
while its still piping hot,
I do have a few more questions,if you dont mind.
Ill give you the $3.10 back.
I have to b*atmy husband home.
Would your husbandbe happy if you were late,
but had another $10?
Well, I guess it would help.
Good evening, maam.Whats your name, little girl?
Its Stacy.ls that your question?
Would you say that you eathere weekly, monthly?
Too much.
Whats your favorite thingabout Burger Chef?
The taste or the price?
Its near my house.
Convenience.
Usually.
Does your husbandever pick it up?
Oh, he wouldnt do that.
Its bad enoughthat Im not making dinner.
Is that all?
Come back soon.
How much money do you have?
Two more familiesand Chinese for us.
Its not a listing.Its Sybils apartment.
Im not squatting.
I can afford a hotel.
Its seven nights.
Im not paying for it, Bonita.
Let me at least payfor the theater tickets.
I get them for free.
Well, Im going to buy youa pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.
I want you shopping all day...
and screwing all night.
Youll spend the weekendwith me, wont you?
I will need to spend someof Saturday afternoon in Cos Cob.
Well, Ill come.
Why would you want to do that?
I sure would like to meet Tammy.
I picked out her Barbie.
I dont want to confuse her, baby.
Shes probably more confused
that her parentsarent actually divorced.
So thats somethingthat bothers you.
Of course it bothers me.
I dont know where this is going,
but I dont want it to failon account of delay.
I havent seen her in a while.
Next time... I promise.
I thought you were nevergoing to get married again.
Meet me in the restroomin 60 seconds.
Ive always wanted to do that.
- Arent you going to eat?- Ill have a roll at the office.
Well, youre disappearing.
Every time you say somethinglike that, I go off my diet.
Go outdoors today, please.
I hope Im not interrupting.Its Bonnie.
I remember you.
You cant just walk in here.
Bonnie, this is Meredith.
Do you want me to comeand get you in five minutes?
Meredith, thatll be all.
Petes having quite a homecoming,so I thought Id duck in.
Youre the only one I know here.
How long are you in town?
I hate to say it,but I knew where to find you.
- Don, how are you?- Good to see you.
I like what youve donewith the place.
I heard you have quite the home.
Pete says its 2,000 square feet.
Not quite.
Peggys going to be leading usthrough the work, as it were.
I assume youre attending.
- Burger Chef?- Youre on the team.
Id like you to be there.
- I guess this is my cue.- Baloney.
Walk me to the conference room.
He wants to make sureeveryones seen you.
- Ta-ta.- Very well.
ls this the billboard?
Its kind of lackluster.
Thats the tray liner.
- Thats everything, chief.- Thank you, Stan.
- Hello, Stan.- Good to see you, Pete.
Hows life treating you?
Im in New York and Im in love.
Me as well.
Hello, Pete.
Well, I think we shouldget this started.
Did you need something, Don?
Ive asked Don to join us.
I didnt know you wanted the team.Should we get Mathis as well?
No, Dons plenty.
Well, he has been instrumental.
I think were circling a strategy--
all the research points to the factthat mothers feel guilty.
They dont eat at the restaurant
because of what Mathis callsa "cleanliness fetish."
And even when they get home,theyre embarrassed.
Our job is to turn Burger Chefinto a special treat served with love.
So the more these womengo to Burger Chef,
- the worse they feel.- Yes.
We need to address how to givehomemakers permission.
Well, who gives moms permission?
Dads.
Its a dark night.
Reveal our morn, driving,girl in a tutu next to her,
boy wearing a football helmetin the back.
Push into a close-upas we hear Moms voice--
the things on her mind.
"Lets see, check that listfor the marching band fundraiser.
Get the sink trap checked.
Get Jim to take downthe storm windows.
Jim!
Jim will be homein a half an hour."
Just then the little girl says,"Im hungry."
The boy says, "Im starving."
Mom says, "One more stop."
We see the reflectionof the Burger Chef sign
on the station wagon windshieldas she pulls in.
Mom gets out of the car.
A handsome man comes outholding a bag.
Mom walks up to himand gives him a deep kiss.
The kids in the carlooking surprised.
He laughs and says,"Can I take you to dinner?"
She says, "Next time,let me get dinner.
You take downthe storm windows."
Cut to them at the kitchen table,
camera moving from faceto smiling face.
Theyre laughing,Mom looks around, smiling.
"Arent you glad
everybody loves Burger Chefas much as you do?"
Very nice.I think its coming along.
Its nice to seefamily happiness again.
Thank you.
What do you think?
The dad surprising the familyabsolves the mom.
Its right on strategy.Its exactly what they wanted.
Don worked the tag overby the syllable.
- Its deceptively simple.- Thank you.
Why dont you take usthrough the legs?
Lets start with radio.
Looky here.A sight for sore eyes.
Ah...
Hello, Jim.
Hows your Burger Chef work going?
Better than yours, I guess.
Thank you, by the way, for failingand giving us a sh*t at it.
Its not McDonalds.Its run by morons.
A lot of companiessucceed that way.
But look who Im talking to.
You dont mean that.
Youre going after fast food.
Youve got your little car--
its not Buick, but its cute.
I know you folks want to bejust like McCann when you grow up.
When we grow up, were goingto k*ll you and marry your wife.
Listen, I hear youre talkingto Philip Morris.
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?
Well, Im just curious how you thinkyoure going to pull that off
with Don Draperhaunting your halls.
Youre so lucky my problemsarent your problems.
What if I wanted them to be?
Are you looking for a job?
No. No.
Im just looking to enrichthe lives of people I respect.
The New York Athletic Clubfrowns on people
making advancesin their steam room.
I was kidding around,but I think youre making eyes at me.
Im gonna go get a massage,relieve some of this tension.
Fellas, we got a live one here.
Come in, join us.
Im drinking rum.
- Do you want some?- No, thank you.
That bar, its hysterical.
My wifes a card.
Im very pleased with the directionI saw this morning.
- We all are.- Thank you.
And-- not but--
I think with my understandingof George Payton
that our success would befurther assured
if Don delivered the presentation.
- Oh.- Heres the but.
It is completely your decision.
Why are you doing this now?
Thats what I said.Shes doing fine.
Lou, first of all,youve never seen Don at his best.
Itll be a tearjerker.
Number two is Peggy,in my mind, will still speak,
but as the mother.
A change of tone.You were wonderful in there.
I dont like being in this position.
I know I can bring this home.
Peggy, you didnt walk into this officeand see Don here.
This is your client,
and youre going to writeas much of it as you want to.
Don will give authority,you will give emotion.
I have authority.And Don has emotion.
I prefer you as an expert witness.
You will introduce him.
But its your decision.
- What?- Its Ted.
Teds on the phone.
Oh.
Hello.
Ive seen the work so far.Im impressed.
And what would you do?
I would use everythingat my disposal to win it.
If you think George Paytonwill prefer it,
Im not going to ignore that.
You know that shes every bit as goodas any woman in this business!
I do.
Hell be great.
Keep up the good work.
Its big and powerfuland costs a fortune,
but it cant make coffee.
Theyve got a computertwice that size
working on the engine for the XP.
- Clara.- Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.
Gentlemen, theres coffee and cakein Mr. Cranes office.
May I take your hats?
Hey, fellas.
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.
- Hello, Kenny.- Hows the kid? ls he flying yet?
Are you kidding?Hes crawling all over the place.
Youve really got to keepan eye on him.
Joan!Come say hello.
Welcome back, Bob.Gentlemen.
How the hell did we end upwith him instead of you?
- No one asked.- This is Bill Hartley.
Bills been bumpedto vice president of brand.
Congratulations.
You certainly pickedthe right place to celebrate.
You mean New York Cityor this very spot?
So far all we have lined upis six hours of network pilots.
Clara, could you take themto Harrys office?
- Enjoy.. Very funny.
Pleasure, maam.
Id love to see you Sunday.
Unless youve made planswith some married guy.
lam all yours.
But if you want to see Kevin,youre going to have to see my mother.
I want to see everyone.
- You need something?- Yes, actually, I do.
Ive given it careful thought,
and I think you should givethe presentation to Burger Chef.
Hold on.
You did a great job this morning.
Thats good to hear,
but I want to have the best chanceof winning this,
and Im not going to pretendyoure not it.
- Whose idea was this?- Mine.
Ill introduce you,and when youre rounding third,
you hand it offto "the voice of moms."
And then you turn and hit the taglike you just thought of it.
- Do I do that?- Yes, you do.
- Whatever you want.- Thats what I want.
Thank you.
You know, I was justnoodling around with the idea
of seeing the whole thingfrom the kids perspective.
- "Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?"- Excuse me?
I dont know.Just a thought.
I appreciate it,but we already have a strategy.
Megan?
Hello!
Oh, Im sorry.
Why didnt you say something?
No, Marsha, this is Megan,Dons wife.
I didnt know he was married.
So nice to meet you.
Marsha, can you get Megansome coffee?
Im fine.
This is very impressive,but where do you work now?
My office is right here.
- Are you a surprise?- No, hes expecting me.
Well, youre a surprise for me.
How is everything in LA?
Its excitingand new and different.
And a lot quieter.
What a great office.
Sooner or later youre goingto get Dons, arent you?
I dont knowhow much better it is.
Hes right next door.
Oh.
Hey!
I didnt expect to see you.
- Megans in for a visit.- Thanks for the subtitles.
- Did you hear about Ginsberg?- Yes. Have you seen him?
I did.She wont go.
All right, Meredith, Im gonna go.
Don.
What are you doing here?
I couldnt wait to see you.
I thought we could eat downtown.
Thats a great idea.
Well, it was so greatto see you both.
Is it okay?I have a visitor.
Enjoy yourself.
Good night.
I miss her.
You didnt even ask mehow the dry run went.
Was there a problem?
No, they loved it.
Are you mad at me?
No.Good night, Stan.
Good night.
Ah, good, youre still here.
Thats your opinion.
I played a round this morningwith Les Clark-
my friend from Philip Morris?
The brand commanderof Commander brand.
Your name came upand I sure would appreciate
you helping us pave that road.
Your secret plan to win the w*r?
Stop thinking about Don
and start thinkingabout the company.
Whos here for William Hartley?
- Bill?- Dont say anything.
But you should say thank youto your boyfriend
- for posting bail.- Has he seen a doctor?
- What did I just say?- Take him to a headshrinker.
He tried to fellatean undercover officer.
May I go?
Good night, ladies.
I called you because I knewyou could keep this to yourself.
You should go to the hospital.
You know theyre justgoing to call the cops.
I wish l was back in Detroit.
Ive got that place wired.
Have you ever been arrested?
No.Never.
I guess youve been lucky.
Well, I appreciate this.
Im going to miss having you around.
lam not of your stripe.
And you should think twicebefore you threaten me like that.
Please.Im not threatening you.
Were moving the XPover to Campbell-Ewald,
and youre moving on.
- Were losing Chevy?- Dont worry.
GM loves the work,and they really love you.
Obviously not.
Your agency hada successful tryout,
but the plan was always to takethe XP in-house.
But Buick is going to come to youwith a great job offer.
What?
Well, thats very good news.
- When does all this happen?- lmminently.
What about you?
Im gonna call in sick.
My wife understands,thank God.
Thats a good idea.
How did you live in this city?
Theres so much temptation.
It was hard.
Hello?
Trudy?
Come along, lets go say hi.
Hello, sweetie.
Its Daddy, sweetheart.
I got you a Barbieall the way from California.
Go ahead.
I dont believe weve met.
- Wheres Trudy?- Shes at the hairdresser.
Im Verna.
Well, Vernas going to comewith us to the car.
Tell me it was all a dream.
Youre in a good mood.
Tell me you didnt miss this.
I missed you.
Well, we are going to eatthis delicious breakfast...
and Im going to take you shopping.
Okay.
Hey, baby,Im almost ready.
"Hi, baby" yourself.Ive been here since 10:00.
- Oh, its you.- Are you coming in?
Find something else to do today.Thats an order.
I dont like the idea.
Of doing something else?
No, the idea for Burger Chef.
You havent been "noodling"with anything else, have you?
It came easy.You dont trust it.
- It didnt come easy at all.- So find a new one.
So you dont like it either.
The work is great!Im positive, exclamation point!
How do I know youre notjust saying that
so you dont have to come in?
Do you need me to come in?
No.
Your babys calling.
But we both knowtheres a better idea.
Theres always a better idea.
Bye.
Look at you!
You say good-bye to your daddy,and then youre going to take a bath.
- Wheres Trudy?- Shes out, Mr. Campbell.
Her cars in the drive.
Well, she came back,but then she went out.
Why dont you give Tammy a bathand let me tuck her in?
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
- Hello?- Hello, dear.
Im afraid Ive beenwaylaid in Cos Cob.
You go without me.Ill pick you up for a drink after.
You really want me to see"Oh! Calcutta!" by myself?
Trudy mustve forgotten.
Theres no oneto look after Tammy.
Oh.
Thats rather inconsiderate,isnt it?
Im sure its just a mistake.
Well, Im going to waituntil the very last minute.
Thats sweet.Ill make it up to you.
You most certainly will.
- Should I get it?- Its not for me.
- Hello?- Oh, Im glad I caught you.
- Are you on your way out?- Just sitting down to dinner.
Well, its just--
I just wanted to let you know thatI tried your "kids point of view" idea,
and its not good.
Well, it was greathearing from you.
Its just I know,now that youre presenting,
youre prone to moreserious thought,
and I just wanted you to knowthat ones a loser.
Im always working, Peggy.So are you.
Why are you undermining me?
From now onI wont express myself.
Well, now its tainted.
Its poisoned, because youexpressed yourself.
If you dont want to do it,dont do it.
Did you lose your appetite?
Absolutely not.
Oh, hello.
Did you just get back?
No, but you did.
Is Tammy still up?
No. We said our good nights.
Vernas back therehiding somewhere.
Well, did you have a nice time?
I was in fine spiritstill I thought about you
pulled over on the side of the roadnecking with Charlie Fiddich.
- Charlie Fiddich?- Well, who was it, then?
Or are you going to keep ita secret from me
like your fathers heart attack?
Youve seen your daughterfor the year.
Dont you have a plane to catch?
I dont like you carrying on like this.Its immoral.
- You have a child.- What?!
You picked tonight for your date?
You still care about me.
I know your debutantemaneuvers.
Were getting a divorce.
Were still married.
Youre not partof this family anymore.
Good night.
Well, hello there.
Well, hello yourself.
Somebody missed you.
Youre early, but welcome.
These are for you.
And that is for you.
- Wow.- Its an Erector Set.
America needs engineers.
What do you say to Uncle Bob?
Thank you.
I know everybody got something,but I was shopping in Midtown
all day yesterdayand I struck out.
The Jews close everythingon Saturday.
Im starving.
I see a day that startswith pancakes
and ends withan ice cream sundae.
Should I bring the stroller?
Ill carry him if l have to.
Let me get my bag.
What are you looking for?
Oh, good morning.
The fondue pot.Its not in the kitchen.
Coffees fine.
No, I thought it would getsome use out there.
I thought you just neededsummer clothes.
I miss my things.
You were dead to the world.
I sleep better when youre here.
Oh, I miss you, too.
Im sorry the visits so short.
Can I just check this inon the plane?
How much is there?I can take some.
When?
The next time I come.End of July.
You know what?
I want to see you somewherewhere theres nothing else going on.


Not LA.Not here.
Just us.
Thatd be nice.
Air-conditioning.
Delicious.
- Did you have fun?- You ate already?
Im sorry, I was hungry.
I can eat again.
Look at these feet.
I wore my sandalsand I look like a hobo.
My toenails are black.
You cant wear those in the city.
You might as well be barefoot.
Will you try on your wares?Slowly?
At least youre in a better mood.
Come over here.
Did you get your work done?
Some of it.
Well, this is my vacation,
and I knew you weregoing to the office,
but the first Saturday we spent here,you needed to see your daughter.
Then you didnt come home,
which I understandwas Trudys fault.
Then you were grumpy.Okay.
Then I amused myselfall morning,
and when I come back,you ordered room service?
Im inundated, sweetheart.
I dont like you in New York.
Well, then you dont like me.
Youre not going to f*ckyour way out of this.
What?
Im going to wash my feet.
Hows it going?
Did you parkyour white horse outside?
Spare me the suspense and tell mewhat your "save the day" plan is.
I dont have anything yet.
The idea I had wasnt great.
It wasnt great.It was terrible.
I want to hear the real one.
Or are you just going to pull it outduring the presentation?
This idea is good.
I think we can getthe client to buy it.
No, you dont, or you wouldnthave questioned it.
Im going to dowhatever you say.
So youre going to pitch the hellout of my shitty idea,
and Im going to fail.
Peggy, Im here to help you dowhatever you want to do.
Well, how am I supposed to know?
Thats a tough one.
- You love this.- Not really.
I want you to feel goodabout what youre doing,
but youll never know.
Thats just the job.
Whats the job?
Living in the "not knowing."
You know, l wouldn’t haveargued if it was me.
I would have just given youa hundred ideas
and never questioned why.
You really want to help me?
Show me how you think.
Do it out loud.
You cant tell peoplewhat they want.
It has to be what you want.
I want to go to the movies.
I just came back from"I Am Curious."
Im still scandalized.
Of course Megan would wantto see a dirty movie.
- You want to work?- It doesnt matter if I want to.
I have to,because all of this is crap.
Pros and cons.
Pros-- its almost doneand its good.
The account mans overjoyedand the clients on board.
Those are the cons,and you know it.
Well...
whenever Im really unsureabout an idea,
first I...
I abuse the peoplewhose help I need.
And then I take a nap.
Done.
Then I startat the beginning again...
see if I end upin the same place.
Moms job is to make dinner.
Burger Chefs job is to stop her.
What is it about that thing?Little boys love it.
"The End of a Party"plays in background
Youre a very lucky person.
Have I been complainingtoo much?
No.
- Did Gail go to bed?- She did.
I know I shouldnt be saying this,
because my heartis pounding.
What?
I know I saidI didnt get you anything...
but I did.
Bob, put that away.
I know I should have done thisa long time ago.
Did I miss my chance?
No.
I dont know.
So you dont feel anything for me?
My face doesnt please you?
I dont believe it.
You dont want this.
Youre not listening to me.
Bob...
you shouldnt be with a woman.
I have been, you know.
Why are you doing this now?
Well, honestly...
Im moving onto Buick.
And GM expectsa certain kind of executive.
- Youre leaving the agency?- Yes.
But thats whyit would work so well.
You could stay here,do whatever you want.
Kevin would have a father.
Or you could come with me.
Youd love Detroit.
We could have a mansion.
- When did all this happen?- I just heard it.
And you cant relay it,
because theyre moving the XPto Campbell-Ewald.
- We lost Chevy?- Yes, but the audition was a success.
Theres something elsecoming down the road.
The times like this, Joan--
this is when you need someone.
We could comfort each otherthrough an uncertain world.
I cant thinkabout this right now.
Im thinking about you, Joan.
Is this what you want?
To be near 40in a two-bedroom apartment
with a mother and a little boy?
I know I am flawed,
but I am offering youmore than anyone else ever will.
No, youre not, Bob.
Because I want love.
And Id rather diehoping that happens
than make some arrangement.
And you should, too.
Im just being realistic.
Good night.
"Forever and Ever"plays in background
Okay, so in this new version,Dads driving the car.
Moms next to him, admiring?
How about a convertible?
Little boy and little girlin the back,
Dads got a pipe in his mouth.
Jesus, its going to look like 1955.
1955 was a good year.
I dont remember.
1965 was a good year.
I got married.
Moms love Burger Chefbecause its an answer to a crisis.
What if Momscoming home from work?
Whats her profession?
You are surrounded
by all kinds of motherswho work, Don.
Its too sad for an ad.
Fine.
She b*rned the roast,
she dented the fender...
Keep going-
She backed over the dog,
little Katies pregnant,Jimmy got drafted,
but there is still a burgerand fries on that table?
Does this family exist anymore?
Are there people who eat dinner
and smile at each otherinstead of watching TV?
Did you ever do thatwith your family?
I dont remember.
What the hell do I knowabout being a mom?
I just turned 30, Don.
Shit. When?
A couple of weeks ago.
It doesnt matter.
I kept it as secret as I could.
Now Im one of those womenlying about her age.
I hate them.
I worry about a lot of things,
but I dont worry about you.
What do you haveto worry about?
That I never did anything,
and that I dont have anyone.
I was in Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania.
I looked in the windowof so many station wagons.
What did I do wrong?
Youre doing great.
What if there was a place
where you could go...
where there was no TV...
and you could break bread...
and whoever you weresitting with was family?

Its official.The XP is no longer ours.
But theyve thought of a name.
Theyre going to call it"Roger Sterlings failure."
- I thought you signed them.- Where did you hear this?
You knew?
I think we shouldget ahead of this.
Im proposinga "New York Times" article
and the "Journal," too, announcingthat were open for business
with our IBM 360and our proprietary software.
And theres a big pictureof Harry Crane,
our newest partner.
What?
The rest of its fine,but Harry Cranes a partner?
If thats what it takes.
Im not going limpinginto Burger Chef.
Why does he have to bea partner?
Say what you will,but hes very loyal.
All in favor?
Opposed?
The motion carries.With two abstentions.
All right,everybody back to work.
Ive got it.
- What the hell do you want?- Not Harry Crane as partner.
Well, you knew about Chevy,and you didnt tell me.
- I could have done something.- There was nothing to do.
Spill the beans or get out.
Bob Benson told me.
- Hes going to Buick.- Bob Benson?
- Please dont get him in trouble.- Youre kidding?
- I knew McCann was up to something.- What are you talking about?
Theyre afraid were goingto steal Buick.
What?
Just forget it.Thank you.
Now we have nothing.Were only weeks away.
Just hear her out.
Shell have you donein time for dinner.
My plans got cancelled.
Look around.
I want to sh**t the ad in here.
- Its not a home.- Its better.
Its a clean, well-lighted place.
Okay, Hemingway.
As long as its still about moms.
Its about family.
Every table here is the family table.
I hate even the word "family."
Its vague.
"Mom" is more specific.Tell her, Don.
Shes doing it the wayshe wants to do it.
You want it right or not?
