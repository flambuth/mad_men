I'm sorry to bother you,
but we're the people who paid for your meal,
and as much as I am committed to you enjoying your food
while it's still piping hot,
I do have a few more questions, if you don't mind.
I'll give you the $3.10 back.
I have to b*at my husband home.
Would your husband be happy if you were late,
but had another $10?
Well, I guess it would help.
Good evening, ma'am. What's your name, little girl?
It's Stacy. ls that your question?
Would you say that you eat here weekly, monthly?
Too much.
What's your favorite thing about Burger Chef?
The taste or the price?
It's near my house.
Convenience.
Usually.
Does your husband ever pick it up?
Oh, he wouldn't do that.
It's bad enough that I'm not making dinner.
Is that all?
Come back soon.
How much money do you have?
Two more families and Chinese for us.
It's not a listing. It's Sybil's apartment.
I'm not squatting.
I can afford a hotel.
It's seven nights.
I'm not paying for it, Bonita.
Let me at least pay for the theater tickets.
I get them for free.
Well, I'm going to buy you a pair of loafers on Fifth Avenue.
I want you shopping all day...
and screwing all night.
You'll spend the weekend with me, won't you?
I will need to spend some of Saturday afternoon in Cos Cob.
Well, I'll come.
Why would you want to do that?
I sure would like to meet Tammy.
I picked out her Barbie.
I don't want to confuse her, baby.
She's probably more confused
that her parents aren't actually divorced.
So that's something that bothers you.
Of course it bothers me.
I don't know where this is going,
but I don't want it to fail on account of delay.
I haven't seen her in a while.
Next time... I promise.
I thought you were never going to get married again.
Meet me in the restroom in 60 seconds.
I've always wanted to do that.
- Aren't you going to eat? - I'll have a roll at the office.
Well, you're disappearing.
Every time you say something like that, I go off my diet.
Go outdoors today, please.
I hope I'm not interrupting. It's Bonnie.
I remember you.
You can't just walk in here.
Bonnie, this is Meredith.
Do you want me to come and get you in five minutes?
Meredith, that'll be all.
Pete's having quite a homecoming, so I thought I'd duck in.
You're the only one I know here.
How long are you in town?
I hate to say it, but I knew where to find you.
- Don, how are you? - Good to see you.
I like what you've done with the place.
I heard you have quite the home.
Pete says it's 2,000 square feet.
Not quite.
Peggy's going to be leading us through the work, as it were.
I assume you're attending.
- Burger Chef? - You're on the team.
I'd like you to be there.
- I guess this is my cue. - Baloney.
Walk me to the conference room.
He wants to make sure everyone's seen you.
- Ta-ta. - Very well.
ls this the billboard?
It's kind of lackluster.
That's the tray liner.
- That's everything, chief. - Thank you, Stan.
- Hello, Stan. - Good to see you, Pete.
How's life treating you?
I'm in New York and I'm in love.
Me as well.
Hello, Pete.
Well, I think we should get this started.
Did you need something, Don?
I've asked Don to join us.
I didn't know you wanted the team. Should we get Mathis as well?
No, Don's plenty.
Well, he has been instrumental.
I think we're circling a strategy--
all the research points to the fact that mothers feel guilty.
They don't eat at the restaurant
because of what Mathis calls a "cleanliness fetish."
And even when they get home, they're embarrassed.
Our job is to turn Burger Chef into a special treat served with love.
So the more these women go to Burger Chef,
- the worse they feel. - Yes.
We need to address how to give homemakers permission.
Well, who gives moms permission?
Dads.
It's a dark night.
Reveal our morn, driving, girl in a tutu next to her,
boy wearing a football helmet in the back.
Push into a close-up as we hear Mom's voice--
the things on her mind.
"Let's see, check that list for the marching band fundraiser.
Get the sink trap checked.
Get Jim to take down the storm windows.
Jim!
Jim will be home in a half an hour."
Just then the little girl says, "I'm hungry."
The boy says, "I'm starving."
Mom says, "One more stop."
We see the reflection of the Burger Chef sign
on the station wagon windshield as she pulls in.
Mom gets out of the car.
A handsome man comes out holding a bag.
Mom walks up to him and gives him a deep kiss.
The kids in the car looking surprised.
He laughs and says, "Can I take you to dinner?"
She says, "Next time, let me get dinner.
You take down the storm windows."
Cut to them at the kitchen table,
camera moving from face to smiling face.
They're laughing, Mom looks around, smiling.
"Aren't you glad
everybody loves Burger Chef as much as you do?"
Very nice. I think it's coming along.
It's nice to see family happiness again.
Thank you.
What do you think?
The dad surprising the family absolves the mom.
It's right on strategy. It's exactly what they wanted.
Don worked the tag over by the syllable.
- It's deceptively simple. - Thank you.
Why don't you take us through the legs?
Let's start with radio.
Looky here. A sight for sore eyes.
Ah...
Hello, Jim.
How's your Burger Chef work going?
Better than yours, I guess.
Thank you, by the way, for failing and giving us a sh*t at it.
It's not McDonald's. It's run by morons.
A lot of companies succeed that way.
But look who I'm talking to.
You don't mean that.
You're going after fast food.
You've got your little car--
it's not Buick, but it's cute.
I know you folks want to be just like McCann when you grow up.
When we grow up, we're going to k*ll you and marry your wife.
Listen, I hear you're talking to Philip Morris.
Is Leo Burnett in here, too?
Well, I'm just curious how you think you're going to pull that off
with Don Draper haunting your halls.
You're so lucky my problems aren't your problems.
What if I wanted them to be?
Are you looking for a job?
No. No.
I'm just looking to enrich the lives of people I respect.
The New York Athletic Club frowns on people
making advances in their steam room.
I was kidding around, but I think you're making eyes at me.
I'm gonna go get a massage, relieve some of this tension.
Fellas, we got a live one here.
Come in, join us.
I'm drinking rum.
- Do you want some? - No, thank you.
That bar, it's hysterical.
My wife's a card.
I'm very pleased with the direction I saw this morning.
- We all are. - Thank you.
And-- not but--
I think with my understanding of George Payton
that our success would be further assured
if Don delivered the presentation.
- Oh. - Here's the but.
It is completely your decision.
Why are you doing this now?
That's what I said. She's doing fine.
Lou, first of all, you've never seen Don at his best.
It'll be a tearjerker.
Number two is Peggy, in my mind, will still speak,
but as the mother.
A change of tone. You were wonderful in there.
I don't like being in this position.
I know I can bring this home.
Peggy, you didn't walk into this office and see Don here.
This is your client,
and you're going to write as much of it as you want to.
Don will give authority, you will give emotion.
I have authority. And Don has emotion.
I prefer you as an expert witness.
You will introduce him.
But it's your decision.
- What? - It's Ted.
Ted's on the phone.
Oh.
Hello.
I've seen the work so far. I'm impressed.
And what would you do?
I would use everything at my disposal to win it.
If you think George Payton will prefer it,
I'm not going to ignore that.
You know that she's every bit as good as any woman in this business!
I do.
He'll be great.
Keep up the good work.
It's big and powerful and costs a fortune,
but it can't make coffee.
They've got a computer twice that size
working on the engine for the XP.
- Clara. - Nice to see you, Mr. Benson.
Gentlemen, there's coffee and cake in Mr. Crane's office.
May I take your hats?
Hey, fellas.
Jack, Bill, nice to see you.
- Hello, Kenny. - How's the kid? ls he flying yet?
Are you kidding? He's crawling all over the place.
You've really got to keep an eye on him.
Joan! Come say hello.
Welcome back, Bob. Gentlemen.
How the hell did we end up with him instead of you?
- No one asked. - This is Bill Hartley.
Bill's been bumped to vice president of brand.
Congratulations.
You certainly picked the right place to celebrate.
You mean New York City or this very spot?
So far all we have lined up is six hours of network pilots.
Clara, could you take them to Harry's office?
- Enjoy. . Very funny.
Pleasure, ma'am.
I'd love to see you Sunday.
Unless you've made plans with some married guy.
lam all yours.
But if you want to see Kevin, you're going to have to see my mother.
I want to see everyone.
- You need something? - Yes, actually, I do.
I've given it careful thought,
and I think you should give the presentation to Burger Chef.
Hold on.
You did a great job this morning.
That's good to hear,
but I want to have the best chance of winning this,
and I'm not going to pretend you're not it.
- Whose idea was this? - Mine.
I'll introduce you, and when you're rounding third,
you hand it off to "the voice of moms."
And then you turn and hit the tag like you just thought of it.
- Do I do that? - Yes, you do.
- Whatever you want. - That's what I want.
Thank you.
You know, I was just noodling around with the idea
of seeing the whole thing from the kids' perspective.
- "Mom, can we go to Burger Chef?" - Excuse me?
I don't know. Just a thought.
I appreciate it, but we already have a strategy.
Megan?
Hello!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why didn't you say something?
No, Marsha, this is Megan, Don's wife.
I didn't know he was married.
So nice to meet you.
Marsha, can you get Megan some coffee?
I'm fine.
This is very impressive, but where do you work now?
My office is right here.
- Are you a surprise? - No, he's expecting me.
Well, you're a surprise for me.
How is everything in LA?
It's exciting and new and different.
And a lot quieter.
What a great office.
Sooner or later you're going to get Don's, aren't you?
I don't know how much better it is.
He's right next door.
Oh.
Hey!
I didn't expect to see you.
- Megan's in for a visit. - Thanks for the subtitles.
- Did you hear about Ginsberg? - Yes. Have you seen him?
I did. She won't go.
All right, Meredith, I'm gonna go.
Don.
What are you doing here?
I couldn't wait to see you.
I thought we could eat downtown.
That's a great idea.
Well, it was so great to see you both.
Is it okay? I have a visitor.
Enjoy yourself.
Good night.
I miss her.
You didn't even ask me how the dry run went.
Was there a problem?
No, they loved it.
Are you mad at me?
No. Good night, Stan.
Good night.
Ah, good, you're still here.
That's your opinion.
I played a round this morning with Les Clark-
my friend from Philip Morris?
The brand commander of Commander brand.
Your name came up and I sure would appreciate
you helping us pave that road.
Your secret plan to win the w*r?
Stop thinking about Don
and start thinking about the company.
Who's here for William Hartley?
- Bill? - Don't say anything.
But you should say thank you to your boyfriend
- for posting bail. - Has he seen a doctor?
- What did I just say? - Take him to a headshrinker.
He tried to fellate an undercover officer.
May I go?
Good night, ladies.
I called you because I knew you could keep this to yourself.
You should go to the hospital.
You know they're just going to call the cops.
I wish l was back in Detroit.
I've got that place wired.
Have you ever been arrested?
No. Never.
I guess you've been lucky.
Well, I appreciate this.
I'm going to miss having you around.
lam not of your stripe.
And you should think twice before you threaten me like that.
Please. I'm not threatening you.
We're moving the XP over to Campbell-Ewald,
and you're moving on.
- We're losing Chevy? - Don't worry.
GM loves the work, and they really love you.
Obviously not.
Your agency had a successful tryout,
but the plan was always to take the XP in-house.
But Buick is going to come to you with a great job offer.
What?
Well, that's very good news.
- When does all this happen? - lmminently.
What about you?
I'm gonna call in sick.
My wife understands, thank God.
That's a good idea.
How did you live in this city?
There's so much temptation.
It was hard.
Hello?
Trudy?
Come along, let's go say hi.
Hello, sweetie.
It's Daddy, sweetheart.
I got you a Barbie all the way from California.
Go ahead.
I don't believe we've met.
- Where's Trudy? - She's at the hairdresser.
I'm Verna.
Well, Verna's going to come with us to the car.
Tell me it was all a dream.
You're in a good mood.
Tell me you didn't miss this.
I missed you.
Well, we are going to eat this delicious breakfast...
and I'm going to take you shopping.
Okay.
Hey, baby, I'm almost ready.
"Hi, baby" yourself. I've been here since 10:00.
- Oh, it's you. - Are you coming in?
Find something else to do today. That's an order.
I don't like the idea.
Of doing something else?
No, the idea for Burger Chef.
You haven't been "noodling" with anything else, have you?
It came easy. You don't trust it.
- It didn't come easy at all. - So find a new one.
So you don't like it either.
The work is great! I'm positive, exclamation point!
How do I know you're not just saying that
so you don't have to come in?
Do you need me to come in?
No.
Your baby's calling.
But we both know there's a better idea.
There's always a better idea.
Bye.
Look at you!
You say good-bye to your daddy, and then you're going to take a bath.
- Where's Trudy? - She's out, Mr. Campbell.
Her car's in the drive.
Well, she came back, but then she went out.
Why don't you give Tammy a bath and let me tuck her in?
Of course, Mr. Campbell.
- Hello? - Hello, dear.
I'm afraid I've been waylaid in Cos Cob.
You go without me. I'll pick you up for a drink after.
You really want me to see "Oh! Calcutta!" by myself?
Trudy must've forgotten.
There's no one to look after Tammy.
Oh.
That's rather inconsiderate, isn't it?
I'm sure it's just a mistake.
Well, I'm going to wait until the very last minute.
That's sweet. I'll make it up to you.
You most certainly will.
- Should I get it? - It's not for me.
- Hello? - Oh, I'm glad I caught you.
- Are you on your way out? - Just sitting down to dinner.
Well, it's just--
I just wanted to let you know that I tried your "kids' point of view" idea,
and it's not good.
Well, it was great hearing from you.
It's just I know, now that you're presenting,
you're prone to more serious thought,
and I just wanted you to know that one's a loser.
I'm always working, Peggy. So are you.
Why are you undermining me?
From now on I won't express myself.
Well, now it's tainted.
It's poisoned, because you expressed yourself.
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.
Did you lose your appetite?
Absolutely not.
Oh, hello.
Did you just get back?
No, but you did.
Is Tammy still up?
No. We said our good nights.
Verna's back there hiding somewhere.
Well, did you have a nice time?
I was in fine spirits till I thought about you
pulled over on the side of the road necking with Charlie Fiddich.
- Charlie Fiddich? - Well, who was it, then?
Or are you going to keep it a secret from me
like your father's heart attack?
You've seen your daughter for the year.
Don't you have a plane to catch?
I don't like you carrying on like this. It's immoral.
- You have a child. - What?!
You picked tonight for your date?
You still care about me.
I know your debutante maneuvers.
We're getting a divorce.
We're still married.
You're not part of this family anymore.
Good night.
Well, hello there.
Well, hello yourself.
Somebody missed you.
You're early, but welcome.
These are for you.
And that is for you.
- Wow. - It's an Erector Set.
America needs engineers.
What do you say to Uncle Bob?
Thank you.
I know everybody got something, but I was shopping in Midtown
all day yesterday and I struck out.
The Jews close everything on Saturday.
I'm starving.
I see a day that starts with pancakes
and ends with an ice cream sundae.
Should I bring the stroller?
I'll carry him if l have to.
Let me get my bag.
What are you looking for?
Oh, good morning.
The fondue pot. It's not in the kitchen.
Coffee's fine.
No, I thought it would get some use out there.
I thought you just needed summer clothes.
I miss my things.
You were dead to the world.
I sleep better when you're here.
Oh, I miss you, too.
I'm sorry the visit's so short.
Can I just check this in on the plane?
How much is there? I can take some.
When?
The next time I come. End of July.
You know what?
I want to see you somewhere where there's nothing else going on.


Not LA. Not here.
Just us.
That'd be nice.
Air-conditioning.
Delicious.
- Did you have fun? - You ate already?
I'm sorry, I was hungry.
I can eat again.
Look at these feet.
I wore my sandals and I look like a hobo.
My toenails are black.
You can't wear those in the city.
You might as well be barefoot.
Will you try on your wares? Slowly?
At least you're in a better mood.
Come over here.
Did you get your work done?
Some of it.
Well, this is my vacation,
and I knew you were going to the office,
but the first Saturday we spent here, you needed to see your daughter.
Then you didn't come home,
which I understand was Trudy's fault.
Then you were grumpy. Okay.
Then I amused myself all morning,
and when I come back, you ordered room service?
I'm inundated, sweetheart.
I don't like you in New York.
Well, then you don't like me.
You're not going to f*ck your way out of this.
What?
I'm going to wash my feet.
How's it going?
Did you park your white horse outside?
Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is.
I don't have anything yet.
The idea I had wasn't great.
It wasn't great. It was terrible.
I want to hear the real one.
Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?
This idea is good.
I think we can get the client to buy it.
No, you don't, or you wouldn't have questioned it.
I'm going to do whatever you say.
So you're going to pitch the hell out of my shitty idea,
and I'm going to fail.
Peggy, I'm here to help you do whatever you want to do.
Well, how am I supposed to know?
That's a tough one.
- You love this. - Not really.
I want you to feel good about what you're doing,
but you'll never know.
That's just the job.
What's the job?
Living in the "not knowing."
You know, l wouldn’t have argued if it was me.
I would have just given you a hundred ideas
and never questioned why.
You really want to help me?
Show me how you think.
Do it out loud.
You can't tell people what they want.
It has to be what you want.
I want to go to the movies.
I just came back from "I Am Curious."
I'm still scandalized.
Of course Megan would want to see a dirty movie.
- You want to work? - It doesn't matter if I want to.
I have to, because all of this is crap.
Pros and cons.
Pros-- it's almost done and it's good.
The account man's overjoyed and the client's on board.
Those are the cons, and you know it.
Well...
whenever I'm really unsure about an idea,
first I...
I abuse the people whose help I need.
And then I take a nap.
Done.
Then I start at the beginning again...
see if I end up in the same place.
Mom's job is to make dinner.
Burger Chef's job is to stop her.
What is it about that thing? Little boys love it.
"The End of a Party" plays in background
You're a very lucky person.
Have I been complaining too much?
No.
- Did Gail go to bed? - She did.
I know I shouldn't be saying this,
because my heart is pounding.
What?
I know I said I didn't get you anything...
but I did.
Bob, put that away.
I know I should have done this a long time ago.
Did I miss my chance?
No.
I don't know.
So you don't feel anything for me?
My face doesn't please you?
I don't believe it.
You don't want this.
You're not listening to me.
Bob...
you shouldn't be with a woman.
I have been, you know.
Why are you doing this now?
Well, honestly...
I'm moving onto Buick.
And GM expects a certain kind of executive.
- You're leaving the agency? - Yes.
But that's why it would work so well.
You could stay here, do whatever you want.
Kevin would have a father.
Or you could come with me.
You'd love Detroit.
We could have a mansion.
- When did all this happen? - I just heard it.
And you can't relay it,
because they're moving the XP to Campbell-Ewald.
- We lost Chevy? - Yes, but the audition was a success.
There's something else coming down the road.
The times like this, Joan--
this is when you need someone.
We could comfort each other through an uncertain world.
I can't think about this right now.
I'm thinking about you, Joan.
Is this what you want?
To be near 40 in a two-bedroom apartment
with a mother and a little boy?
I know I am flawed,
but I am offering you more than anyone else ever will.
No, you're not, Bob.
Because I want love.
And I'd rather die hoping that happens
than make some arrangement.
And you should, too.
I'm just being realistic.
Good night.
"Forever and Ever" plays in background
Okay, so in this new version, Dad's driving the car.
Mom's next to him, admiring?
How about a convertible?
Little boy and little girl in the back,
Dad's got a pipe in his mouth.
Jesus, it's going to look like 1955.
1955 was a good year.
I don't remember.
1965 was a good year.
I got married.
Moms love Burger Chef because it's an answer to a crisis.
What if Mom's coming home from work?
What's her profession?
You are surrounded
by all kinds of mothers who work, Don.
It's too sad for an ad.
Fine.
She b*rned the roast,
she dented the fender...
Keep going-
She backed over the dog,
little Katie's pregnant, Jimmy got drafted,
but there is still a burger and fries on that table?
Does this family exist anymore?
Are there people who eat dinner
and smile at each other instead of watching TV?
Did you ever do that with your family?
I don't remember.
What the hell do I know about being a mom?
I just turned 30, Don.
Shit. When?
A couple of weeks ago.
It doesn't matter.
I kept it as secret as I could.
Now I'm one of those women lying about her age.
I hate them.
I worry about a lot of things,
but I don't worry about you.
What do you have to worry about?
That I never did anything,
and that I don't have anyone.
I was in Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania.
I looked in the window of so many station wagons.
What did I do wrong?
You're doing great.
What if there was a place
where you could go...
where there was no TV...
and you could break bread...
and whoever you were sitting with was family?

It's official. The XP is no longer ours.
But they've thought of a name.
They're going to call it "Roger Sterling's failure."
- I thought you signed them. - Where did you hear this?
You knew?
I think we should get ahead of this.
I'm proposing a "New York Times" article
and the "Journal," too, announcing that we're open for business
with our IBM 360 and our proprietary software.
And there's a big picture of Harry Crane,
our newest partner.
What?
The rest of it's fine, but Harry Crane's a partner?
If that's what it takes.
I'm not going limping into Burger Chef.
Why does he have to be a partner?
Say what you will, but he's very loyal.
All in favor?
Opposed?
The motion carries. With two abstentions.
All right, everybody back to work.
I've got it.
- What the hell do you want? - Not Harry Crane as partner.
Well, you knew about Chevy, and you didn't tell me.
- I could have done something. - There was nothing to do.
Spill the beans or get out.
Bob Benson told me.
- He's going to Buick. - Bob Benson?
- Please don't get him in trouble. - You're kidding?
- I knew McCann was up to something. - What are you talking about?
They're afraid we're going to steal Buick.
What?
Just forget it. Thank you.
Now we have nothing. We're only weeks away.
Just hear her out.
She'll have you done in time for dinner.
My plans got cancelled.
Look around.
I want to sh**t the ad in here.
- It's not a home. - It's better.
It's a clean, well-lighted place.
Okay, Hemingway.
As long as it's still about moms.
It's about family.
Every table here is the family table.
I hate even the word "family."
It's vague.
"Mom" is more specific. Tell her, Don.
She's doing it the way she wants to do it.
You want it right or not?
