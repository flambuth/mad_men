What are you doing? Ill make breakfast.
Don, youre gonna be late.
Damn it.
- Bonjour, Marie.- Would you like an omelet?
Id better not.
You cant eat an egg?
Do I have to call the dentist?
Itll go away. It always does.
Go easy on the mouthwash.
Have fun.
Why bother him?
With what?
"Were sorry that theres beenno response to your reel.
"We would encourage you to try ouradvanced film workshop for a low..."
What is it?
I paid for a screen test.
They were supposed to send it to agents.
And they werent interested?
How could they havesent it to anybody but me in a week?
Theyre selling classes.
Its a great thingto take advantage of hopeless people.
Hopeless?
Beth, I dont knowif you remember Pete Campbell.
Of course. We almost had dinner.
How was the second honeymoon?Did you create another beneficiary?
So where are you off to?
Shes gonna staywith her sister for a little bit.
And where is that?
You know what, honey?Im going to the smoker.
- Well have to stand.- You dont have to come.
Dont take it personally.
Shes in a mood.
Excuse me. Can I just get by here, please?
- Go right ahead.- Thank you.
Morning.
-38? Where are you going?- I made a mistake.
Okay.
Because I heard thatthe parachute company upstairs
got a big government contractand moved to Washington
to be closer to the cemetery or something.
For once, mind your own business, Harry.
All Im saying is if were getting more space,Ill take anything without a column in it.
We offered you another officeand you turned it down.
You didnt want his office either.
So is it true or not?
I need a window, Joan. Im getting scurvy.
Adam?
Topaz. Always less expensive. Never cheap.
- I hate it.- No, you dont.
So were aiming for cheap girls?
- Girls not cheap.- So were cheap.
Art, come on.We agreed on a value approach.
- I hate the word "cheap."- And so do I!
Thats why I put the word"never" in front of it.
You say the word, you put it on their mind.
I hate to quote you directly,
but didnt you say that with Topaz,a girl could be sexy for pocket change?
I thought it was gonna be"Two for one, twice the fun."
That really sounds cheap.
Perhaps Don can answer this.
Gentlemen, how are you?
Art and Marvin object to the word "cheap."
Youre aware the worddoes not refer to Topaz.
Clearly it states the exact opposite.And its very funny.
Were supposed to be part of a fantasy,
and I dont think cheapis part of any girls fantasy.
Why dont you get a girls opinion?
I used to take that as a given here.
And Im not talking aboutblack coffee out there.
- Were happy to copy test it for you.- Whats that gonna cost?
Theyre not charging us.They shouldve done it already.
- Let me walk you out.- See you soon.
Why the hell didnt you get any research?
Because we never hadto do it for them before.
The client didnt like it and we did.
In the end, isnt thathow we know its good?
- Then this is a success.- I consider it a success.
You didnt have to go a single daywithout telling me Im an idiot.
Ill tell you what,Im so bored of this dynamic.
I have your sister-in-law.
- Hello, Judy.- No, its me.
Beth.
- I know who it is.- I have to see you.
Jesus, Im at work.
Clara, could you go to the lobbyand get me a pack of Life Savers?
Whats wrong with the machine?
I want them fresh.
So you ran into me on the trainand suddenly remember who I was?
Meet me where you wanted to meet before,the Hotel Pennsylvania.
Ill be there at noonunder the name Mrs. Campbell.
I hope you like waiting. Thats what I did.
This may be our last chance.
Why is this so hard?
It has to be 125 wordsand 15 of them have to be "Ajax."
Fellas, can I have Miss Olsonto myself for a minute?
Do you smoke?
Not really.
Well, get started.
Smoke it, name it, sell it.
What is it?
Philip Morris top secret ladies cigarette.
Leo Burnett thinks its too small,and now its in review.
So its yourjob to make sure theyre sorry.
- Great.- Evan!
Flip through the research at your leisureand then get your little ones on it.
Did they tell you anything I should know?
Does your boyfriend light your cigarettes?
- I dont smoke.- Yes, you do.
Its gotta make noise.Maybe she lights it herself.
So is that what it is,or is it something like that?
Youre a woman and you smoke.What do you want?
All of last years thirdand fourth quarters work has posted
with sizeable checks from Vicks,Sugarberry and Heinz in the bank.
And with Mohawk returningto its prestrike billings,
revenues are up 34% from last year,making this our best quarter.
Its March. Its our only quarter.
Not this year. Ever.
And with Jaguar due to run
and Butler sh**tingand running within the month,
projections for next quarterare equally bright.
Have you found me an office?
Unfortunately, I was unableto go upstairs this morning.
Harry Crane.
But I am meetingwith the building manager at lunch.
Get more than we need.
Any objections?
Im sorry, but I feelsomeone has to voice the negatives.
Perhaps after one quarter, we should becareful not to overextend ourselves.
Can we just vote?
Or we could tablethis discussion until June.
- All in favor of tabling the vote?- Aye.
Tabling does not require a vote.It only needs to be seconded.
- What is this, parliament?- Is this meeting over yet?
No, its not.
Don, I give you my proxy.I have things to do.
We can do that?
Thank God.
Stop it.
- I knew youd show.- Because Im pathetic?
If youre so angry, why did you come?
You know I had to.
Come sit with me.
Im not going to my sisters.
I... Well, Howard checked meinto the hospital this morning.
For what? Whats wrong?
Its hard to explain,but Ive been very blue
and the doctors seem to thinkthe only thing to do is electroshock.
Shock treatment? Youre not crazy.
Look, Peter, I wanted to see youbecause its going to be different after.
It always is.
Youve done it before?
Yes.
And it creates this sort of gray cloud.
The last time, I lost months and...
This is wonderful. Youre wonderful.
I dont want to forgetand Im afraid I will.
I told them I was goingto my nieces birthday party.
I have to be back by 5:00so Ill be ready for tomorrow.
What makes you think I would do this?You are crazy.
Please.
Please give me this.
Oh, God.
Why does everybody want redheads?
Anybody can become a redhead.I mean, even Julias working.
Working?
She did three days on Dark Shadowsand then they fired her and cut her out.
Shit. I keep telling her how good she was.
This is why youre not working.You wont answer the phone.
Hello?
I can hear you.
Heavy breathing?
I thought it was a wrong number,but they keep calling
and they never say theyre sorry.
I wish you would have told mewe had company.
I wouldnt have come out like this.
Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Mother, this is Emily from class.- Pleasure.
Megan, did you get me an appointmentfor a wash and set?
Yes, Mama.
- How long are you in town for?- Only a week.
I wanted to spend Easter with my daughter.My husband is an atheist.
What are your plans for today?
- We are looking at the casting notices.- Bonne chance.
Shes so elegant and encouraging.
I guess so.
Listen.
I hope you know that if I could ever help youin any way, I would want you to ask.
Okay.
My agent put me up for this part.Its really cute.
Its based on Beauty and the Beast
and, well, its a commercialfor Barnett shoes.
And?
Dons the Draperin Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce, isnt he?
- Do you mean Butler shoes?- Yes, thats it.
Look, I really dont wantto make you uncomfortable.
I am completely prepared for no. I just...
It a European type.
Im sorry, but Don doesnt do that.Thats not the way it works.
Its really up to the client.
All I want is an audition.
Id ask you who I have to sleep with,but I dont think youd like it.
Okay. Ill see what I can do.
I am your eternal slave.
But if it doesnt work out,
youre gonna have to actlike you never asked.
Now find me a job.
I should go.
Howards coming by after work.
It was terrible.
I couldnt find the party,then I couldnt get a cab.
For four hours?
Dont tell me youre not happy right now.Dont tell me you dont feel better.
Howard cant make you do this.
He wants to control you. Hes a monster.
You just hate himbecause he voted for Goldwater.
This is not a joke.
Lets go to Los Angeles. Ive been there.Its filled with sunshine.
I cant.
Why?
Its so dark, Peter,
that I just
get to this placeand I suddenly feel this door open
and I wanna walk through it.
Thats for weak people,
people who cant solve a problem.
You want to solve a problem? Zip me up.
And then youll leave.
- And what if you forget you love me?- Peter.
I dont know you and you dont know me.
We just happen to have the same problem.
I know, but were only sadbecause were apart.
Then I was wrong.
I really should go.
Why?
Because it works.
Really?
Five more minutes.
- Hello.- How are you feeling?
- Better.- Good.
Just in case, I made soup.
Ill change for dinner.
Well be right out.
Are you really feeling better?I didnt get a kiss.
I swear Im better.
Emily was telling me that Butler shoesis sh**ting a new commercial.
"Beauty and the Beast."
Well, she said theyre lookingfor a European girl.
And I was thinking,
well, Id be mad at myself if I didnt ask,
and, well, I wouldnt ask
if I didnt think Id be right for it,but I really am.
What?
All I want you to dois put my name in a pile.
I know theyre gonna wanna seewhat I look like on film
and I happen to have it.
You wanna be in a commercial?
I wanna work.
Its in town, so Id be home for dinner.
- I thought you hated advertising.- I never said that.
Well, you certainly dont think its art.And youre an artist, arent you?
Are you mad at me?
Im just surprised.
Its not theater, its not Broadway,its not film.
A national commercial?All my friends would k*ll for it.
- Youd get in the union, youd get exposure.- Youd get money.
Thats why they want it.You dont need that.
Do you know how hard this wasfor me to even ask you?
Do you know how hard it would be to askCharles Butler Jr. to hire my wife?
I just want an audition.Ill be Megan Calvet.
Ken, Stan and Ginsberg are gonna be there.They know who you are.
- Im gonna call the dentist.- No. Im better.
Listen, just forget I brought any of this up.
Its just...
Its been so hard, you know.
I do. Look, you dont want it this way.
You wanna be somebodys discovery,not somebodys wife.
Youre right. I know youre right.
- Arent you gonna get it?- No. Theyve been hanging up all day.
Hello?
Who is this?
- Hello, is Marie there?- Emile?
Marie, sil vous plait.
Its your father. I think hes drunk.
Hello?
Daddys on the phone.
- AII?, Emile.- Shes got it.
Marie, its Roger.
Marie, its Roger Sterling.Ive used up all the French I know.
What is Regina?
Thank you.
Megan, you know I would if I could.
Of course.
Im gonna take a bath before dinner.
How did you know I was here?
Because Don was complainingyou were drinking all his liquor.
So you wanted to see me?
You could have arranged a dinnerfor the four of us.
Really? Youd do that?
No, because Im not that kind of woman.
No, no, of course youre not.
Its just, well, I enjoy your company
and I thought if you were willingto broach impropriety ever so slightly,
I could have dinnerbrought to my apartment.
The kid from room service can chaperone.
Room service? Is it a hotel?
The Stanhope.And you can just ask for me in the lobby.
Its very discreet.
They just send the girls right up?
Look, I called you.
In fact, I had hung up on your daughterabout a dozen times today.
Im not asking for anything morethan a little conversation, I swear.
Ill try to get away
on the conditionthat you lower your expectations.
Below conversation?
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
How are you feeling?
- Could you get me some ice?- Right away.
Mrs. Harris wants to see you.Shes been waiting in there quite a while.
Morning.
What can I do for you?
I want to reopen the conversationabout more space.
Youre not gonna put anybodyin here, are you?
No.
Its just Ive been trying so hardto be so responsible and careful
and I dont even know why,
because every day I open the mailand theres more money.
Thats the idea, isnt it?
I got this this morning.
The death benefitfrom the company insurance policy.
Its $175,000.
So whats your question?
Why would he do that?
Youll never get an answer.You cant think about that.
But I do. And then I cant stop it.What could I have done?
Nothing.
Its not true.
Why didnt I give him what he wanted?
What did he want?
And now theres this, this profit.
How much did he put in for collateralafter Lucky Strike left?
$50,000.
We should pay that back.
- Shouldnt we have a vote?- No.
Cut a check to his wife.
Are you under the weather?
I have a hot tooth.
I know a dentist.Hes in the steeple of the Chrysler Building.
Even if he cant help you,you still get to see the view.
Itll go away.
I have your ice.
Ill take that.
Put that on your face, not in a drink.
I dont feel well.Just go to The Cloisters without me.
No, Mother.
Im sad.
I know.
What do I do?
Why are you always so nice to strangers?You dont ever care what I wanna do.
Youre supposed to be encouraging.
Not every little girlgets to do what they want.
The world could not supportthat many ballerinas.
Is that what you tell yourself?
Im sorry to drop by like this.
If I sound distracted, its only becauseIm waiting for a bed to be delivered.
My mother is coming to stay.
That should be helpful.
- May I?- Of course.


Id offer you something,but I have nothing in the house.
First, let me offer my apologies.
But with the funeral abroad
and you declining our offerto have a memorial,
I really havent been surehow to express our condolences.
It may be the difference in our cultures,but were not ones to wallow.
Well, Im not sure if youre aware,
but last year the partnerswere required to put up collateral.
And although the firmhas six years to repay,
it was unanimous that we tryand help you through this difficult time.
Again, Im very sorry for your loss.
Yes, I hope you feel better.
I think itll make a difference.
How much is it?
$50,000.
You had no right to filla man like that with ambition.
I found this in his wallet.
Who is this?
- I dont know.- Dont just consider the office.
Think of all the brothels you frequent.
- I should go.- Yes, perhaps you should.
Im truly sorry for your loss.
Its probably difficult for you to believe,
but it was even more than $50,000that already belonged to him,
so dont leave here thinking
that youve done anything for anyonebut yourself.
Hello.
Say hi to Daddy.
The tables set in there.I wanted to leave these out for you.
What is this?
Theyre the plans for the pool.
They can start in May right after the rain.
Thats you.
- I dont know, Trudy. Its awfully permanent.- I know.
Itll add tremendous value to the property.
And Lord knows youre so much betterwhen you get some sun.
Tammy could drown.
What is wrong with you?
Im sorry.
This doom and gloom, Im tired of it.
Not one thing you said was true.
No dinner, no chaperone, no conversation.
Stop being demure.Youre already on the bed.
I hoped that you would call.
And I hoped that you would come.
And not just for obvious reasons.
I dont believe you.
You know, one of my partners,he ended it all.
Youd have to be so sure you were goingsomeplace better, wouldnt you?
But I think maybe that place is here.
Why are you saying this?
Would you take LSD with me?
What?
I love that youre so calm,but youre adventurous.
And honestly, I need to take it againto really appreciate here
and I dont wanna do it alone.
And I think if you were there,then itd be okay.
Roger, please dont ask me for anything.
Please dont ask me to take care of you.
Is there anything else I can do?
There you are, right where you are.
I missed you.
Jesus. Come on.
Lets get you to bed.
- Wheres your mother?- She abandoned me.
You cant even kiss me?
Just go to the dentist,because I need you right now.
- Megan.- Please.
Its the only thing Im good for.
What the hell happened today?
This is what you want, isnt it?For me to be waiting for you.
Thats why you wont give me a chance.
Thats not true.
I know, I know.
Because its either that or Im terrible.
But how the hell would you know?
Youre really drunk.
Sleep it off.
Where were you?
I have friends in New York.
How could you leave her like that,drunk out of her mind?
Shes married to you. Thats yourjob.
She left my house a happy girl.
And you show up and shes miserable.
I know its hard to watch,
but this is what happenswhen you have the artistic temperament
but you are not an artist.
Take my advice,
nurse her through this defeatand you shall have the life you desire.
I have postcards to write.
You almost had a nasty abscess.
You should have had it extracted days ago.
I kept thinking it would go away.
Yeah? Youre lucky you didnt lose yourjaw.
Just breathe through your nose.
Youre in bad shape, Dick.
What are you doing here?
I lost my job when I died.
Im gonna do you a favor and take it out.
But its not your tooth thats rotten.
Dont go.
Dont leave me.
Dont worry.
Ill hang around.
Get it?
Youre gonna be sore,
so just take it easyfor the rest of the day.
Fill that prescription I gave youand dont smoke for 24 hours.
Mrs. Dawes?
Beth, your brothers here to see you.
Yes, of course. Come in.
You know, youre right.
You really do have the same eyes.
Im so glad you came.
How are you feeling?
I dont have a brother.
It was the only way I could get in.
But what are you doing here?
Well, I was worried about you.
Thats right.
Im sorry.
Im in the wrong room.
But you can still visit.
But Im here to visit my friend.
Please.
Please, keep me company.
Whats wrong with your friend?
He...
He got involved
with another mans wife.
And that put him in the hospital?
From the complications.
Why did he do it?
Well, all the regular reasons, I guess.
He needed to let off some steam,
he needed adventure,he needed to feel handsome again.
He needed to feel that he knew something,
that all this aging was worth something
because he knew thingsyoung people didnt know yet.
He probably thought it would be likehaving a few tall drinks
and feeling very, very good.
And then hed go back to his life and say,
"That was nice."
But then he got sick?
When it went away,
he was heartbroken.
And then he realized everythinghe already had was not right either
and that was why it had happened at all.
And that his life with his family was some
temporary bandage on a permanent wound.
Dont worry.
Theyll fix him up here.
Theyre very good.
Hell be fine.
Well, it was nice to meet you.
Good luck with your friend.
Oh, my goodness.
How are you?
- Are you waiting for somebody?- Nope.
What are you doing here?
- Did you lose yourjob?- No.
Did you?
You look good.
Hows Megan?
Shes good.
Youre kind of new at that jobto be avoiding the office.
Just knocking out the cobwebs.
Someone told me this works.
So its going well?
Yeah.
Is that okay?
Thats what happenswhen you help someone,
they succeed and move on.
Dont you want them to?
Im proud of you.
I just didnt know it would be without me.
Well, put me on your call list.
What are you working on?
Were trying to get that womens cigaretteyou were after.
God, I miss that easy money.
Its easy to have. Its not easy to win.
Youll b*at it.
Well, Im going to Virginiato tour the factory.
Im going on a plane.
- Richmonds nice.- Its not Paris.
And Im going with Frank Gleason.
- Will you give my love to Megan?- Sure.
We should all get together.
Yes.
Howdy, partner!
What do you say we get off in Harrison,
get back on the trainand go get into some trouble?
- What?- Im on my own.
You can say you fell asleep. You did.
You are the most disgusting personI have ever seen.
Come on!
How could you do that to that woman?
You just couldnt wait to get herin the hospital and erase her brain.
Its you?
She always spreads her legsfor the first chump she can find.
What you doing?
Break it up!
- Knock it off!- Gentlemen, calm down!
You okay, buddy?
You, Max Schmeling, you go that way.
- He started it.- Out!
- My things are in the bar.- Thats not a surprise.
Youre a real prick, you know that?
Listen, buddy, youre gonnagive it a couple of minutes,
youre gonna go down there and apologize.
To him?
Never.
You gotta ride the train every dayand hes a fellow commuter.
And I dont like fighting on my train.
Its your train.
Are you paying to ride on it?Were paying you to ride on it.
You work for us, so why dont yougo down there and apologize to him?
- Im about to throw you off.- Go ahead, you fat piece of crap.
I am an officer of the New Haven line.
Well, Im presidentof the Howdy Doody circus army.
- Thats it, come on. Youre coming...- Get your hands off me!
You cant do that!
Get off the train. Harrison!
Next stop, Harrison.
What on earth happened?Were you in another car accident?
The cars fine. Theres not a scratch on it.
Im not worried about the car.
My goodness, look at you.
I fell asleep and ran into a ditch.
Come with me.
I cant live like this.
Knowing youre out there working so hard
and then wondering if youre going tocome home and in what condition.
Ill come home.
I think you were right.
And first thing tomorrow morning,
were going to find youan apartment in the city.
I think this is where the staircase goes.
Im going to havethe same view as you, Don.
Congratulations.
There she is. Theres our Beauty.
Nice to see you again.
You look perfect.
- When do we start?- When theyre ready.
I cant believe this is happening.
Miss Calvet, would you step in, please?
You know I love you.
Rehearsal in five.
Give me an Old Fashioned.
Excuse me, do you have a light?
Thank you.
Im sorry, but my friend down there,
she was wondering.
Are you alone?
