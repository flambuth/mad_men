I was waiting up.
I didnt want to wake you.
Don.
What?
I dont know whats going on...
but you have to pull back on the throttle a little, honey.
Don, turn off the range.
Sorry, I forgot about them.
Its fine.
I want to make you a real breakfast. You look terrible.
So do you.
Just stay home today. Can you do that for me?
Please try and sleep it off.
You want to quit in front of Kenny? He hasnt fired a sh*t.
Whatever you fellas want.
Kenny, you need to discharge that w*apon...
before Ray turns us into the Bataan Death March.
You see that tree over there?
Pretend its Ralph Nader and lets go get a drink.
Wait!
Oh, shit.
In recent years, crime in this country...
has grown nine times as fast as population.
At the current rate, the crimes of violence in America will double by 1972.
We cannot accept that kind of future for America.
We owe it to the decent and law-abiding citizens ofAmerica...
to take the offensive against the criminal forces...
that threaten their peace and their security...
and to rebuild respect for law across this country.
I pledge to you, the wave of crime...
is not going to be the wave of the future in America.
I suppose Im supposed to believe that you didnt know that she wasnt me...
when you took her to the boathouse and you had your way.
Im talking to you.
Dont you dare ignore me.
A lot of people laugh at the idea of a girl playing the tuba.
- Hello? - Its me.
Your girl said you were home.
I am.
If youre too sick to talk, it can wait.
I can talk.
It concerns Sally.
What about her?
Shes not coming this weekend either.
Oh. Thats too bad.
Although you should tell her if she does come...
Im gonna be working all weekend.
Why would I tell her that?
It could have been being held hostage by that burglar...
or the fight she had with her friend after Model UN...
but she says shes not going again.
What do you want me to do about it?
I dont know that its a good thing or a bad thing...
but she wants to go away to a boarding school.
Ill pay for all of it.
She has to get in, of course.
How much does that cost?
Eleanor, Henrys daughter, went there and I think shell interview well.
She has good manners with everyone but me.
Shell get in.
I dont know, Don. It is Miss Porters.
Jackie Kennedy went there.
You mean Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
What kind of medicine are you taking for this cold?
Formula 44.
Yeah, I bet.
Jackie did well twice.
So did you.
- Im going to go. - Betts...
will you tell her that Megan-
That we both miss her?
Of course.
Cranberry, Cran-Apple...
Grape-Berry, that would be Cranprune.
Dont let the name fool you.
Theyre all delicious, my friend.
Is that the line?
They are one dried and one fresh fruit for a new generation.
You want to use Vaughn Meader? I thought they buried that guy with JFK.
No, there was this old salt who took us around the plant.
He had a heavy accent and a red shirt.
Ted called him Rose Kennedy.
During all this levity, did you mention that Cranprune sounds like a glass of diarrhea?
When we agreed to take the blends, we agreed to take the names.
Its got less pucker than the Cranberry, but its heavier than the Cran-Apple.
That means Cran-Apple is light.
Light.
- And Cranberry is- - Sour?
- Bitter? - Makes your teeth feel weird?
Its tart. Thats all they keep saying about the berries.
Yes, they do.
You know, I hate to say this again, but I got to take a leak.
Great idea. Peggy.
You want to get some chowdah?
Thought you had to pee.
No, I just wanted to see if I could get him to respond to an idea that wasnt hers.
You look better.
Hello?
I can barely hear you.
Oh, hello, Harry.
What?
Listen, I wouldnt bother you at home.
Obviously Im on the Coast, but Ive got good news.
You finally found a hooker who will take travelers checks?
Why did I tell you that?
I got a packet at the desk and then a phone call from Sunkist.
I told you to drop that.
Well, Jeffrey, the fat one...
he finally got a look at the media plan and suddenly theyre interested in TV.
Theyve called a meeting with Sanford, who I think is a decider.
Dont do that.
Don, theyre talking about two and a half times the print budget.
We cant.
- Why not? - Because we have a conflict.
Ted has Ocean Spray.
You should have told them we withdrew.
Adi√≥s, Harry.
I really didnt want you to work today.
Harry is such a pain in the ass.
Lets get out of here.
That was really, really scary.
It was disturbing.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
That was quite a film.
It was terrifying, wasnt it?
Well, we were, um-
You know were doing the St. Josephs spot based on it...
and Peggy and I had an argument about whether there was a Japanese in the end.
You know, when Mia Farrow walks in and sees the baby...
and the devil worshippers are there.
There was.
I know.
So youd both already seen it?
Yeah. But obviously she remembered it better.
She wants a Japanese in the ad.
They always have a camera.
Were going to grab a bite. Have you eaten?
I should get going. I have a date.
Yes, well, dont let us keep you.
So, Don, I see youre feeling better.
I had to get him out of the house.
We can still go eat.
I am supposed to throw around a football. I should go.
After you.
Oh, my God.
I would never live in an apartment that old.
Theres so many buildings like that in Montreal. Its creepy.
Don?
What? Im gonna have nightmares.
You know whos not gonna sleep?
Why are you so interested in this?
Youre not interested?
Honestly, Im more troubled by the idea...
of using Rosemarys Baby for a childrens aspirin ad.
Why were they going to the movies at 5:00?
They didnt think anybody would be there.
Youve been on a soap too long.
I dont know. I guess.
What time is it in California?
Three hours earlier.
I need to make a phone call.
Okay.
What happened?
Come in.
What the hell happened?
Im fine. Well, obviously not.
I thought you were in Detroit.
I was.
I told them that Cynthia was pregnant...
and they took me out to celebrate and they sh*t me.
- What? - Its not funny.
Chevy is k*ll me.
I hate Detroit.
I hate cars. I hate g*n.
I dont even want to look at a steak anymore.
The only way to get through this is to keep reminding yourself its a great account.
Im gonna be a father. Im gonna have a family.
Pull yourself together. Anyone here would trade places with you in a second.
Did I tell you that on the way to the hospital, they tried to stop for lunch?
Theyre fat yahoos in cheap suits. Im done.
Are you entertaining this idea?
Youll be laughed out of this building and then out of advertising in general.
Itd be a difficult transition.
Chevy wont like it, but I think theyre feeling pretty guilty right now.
Well, if its in your power...
and youre willing to give up what goes with it...
I would gladly take your place.
What about your family?
Trudy and I are separated.
I only see Tammy every other weekend. She wont know the difference.
Im sorry to hear that.
Yes, its unfortunate.
I dont know what to say.
Say youll back me up and Ill be there for you.
Congratulations on the baby.
Thank you.
Is he ready?
- Morning. - Morning.
- Morning. - Hello.
We have what we think is some pretty spectacular news.
Crane called from Los Angeles.
Sunkist finally looked at the media plan...
and enthusiastically embraced a television campaign...
to the tune of eight million dollars.
Great Caesars ghost.
They dont care that were a month into Ocean Spray?
Harry said wed resign.
Apparently they were excited by the spike in color TVs.
Don told them that was the secret- color.
- When did you tell them that? - When we were out there.
But they wouldnt leave Harry alone.
You upset, Ted? Its almost three times the business.
No, I just-
Well, Im dreading making the call.
Well, Ill call Ocean Spray.
And the rest of our clients?
Someone has to let them know to look out for a kn*fe in their back.
You want to turn it down?
Absolutely not. Dont be an idiot, Ted.
Stay out of this, Jim.
Forget about giving someone your word, which obviously doesnt mean anything to you.
How does it look?
The right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing.
Youre right.
We should work more together. We have to. Thats the message from this.
Then its agreed that we have a more coherent approach to new business.
That means no more surprises, Don.
Youre right. I apologize.
But its a great account.
Can we celebrate now?
I think Peggy should be on it.
She has, you know, juice experience now.
That makes sense.
What are you doing?
Getting ready to do a little hunting.
Whats going on? Mr. Cooper wants to see you.
Lets find out.
Thats a.22. Its not good for anything but squirrels, you know.
Would you ever leave New York, Annie Oakley?
Hello, Pete.
Hello, Bob.
Kenny, how are you feeling?
Better than I am right now. Have a seat.
Well, shiver me timbers.
Id laugh, but it hurts like a son of a bitch.
For obvious reasons, Ken is withdrawing from handling Chevy.
You sure you want to do this?
Im positive.
Kenny, you know, I once had a client cup my wifes breast.
Lee Garner, Jr. made me hold his balls.
Well, Im not resigning Chevy.
I just cant be on the ground there anymore.
Pete and I have already discussed it...
and I will stay on the business in New York.
Theyll want that.
Id be lying if I said I wasnt reluctant.
But I know Ken would do the same for me.
Crocodile tears. How quaint.
Look, I know everyones worried...
but Bobs going to be a big help with the transition.
Anything I can do.
In all deference to the weeks Bob spent trying to develop ties with Chevy...
I think its best if I bring in my own team.
Thats a dumb idea.
Any continuity preserves the belief that service has not changed.
Its nothing about Bob in particular...
but isnt it better to create the belief that service has improved?
Pete, youre going to need to know where the land mines are buried.
Id listen to the cyclops, Pete.
I think maybe Im keeping you from discussing this freely.
I understand Petes objections, but I will do whatever is decided.
Pete, theres nothing to discuss. I like Bob, Chevy likes Bob.
And if you dont like Bob, we can find someone who does.
Of course.
By the way, thank you, all of you, for having this trust in me.
Is there a problem?
I dont want to work with you.
I dont want to stay in a hotel with you. Youre sick.
Why would you say that?
So you didnt profess your love to me?
Only my admiration, which is waning quickly.
This is not about my own interests. I care about Chevy.
You should watch what you say to people.
Is that right?
Congratulations. Can you believe this guy?
So?
So what?
Can I have one?
Are you anxious?
I expect you to sail through this interview.
Geez, I wasnt nervous about it a minute ago.
I hope it doesnt ruin it that Im excited for you.
When I was in 10th grade, my friend Annie left-
To go to Rosemary Hall. I know, you told me.
Did I tell you she hated her mother?
Good for her.
Is it about getting away from boys?
If I say yes, will you stop asking?
Im proposing some reasons because you arent being very forthcoming.
Sally, I can turn this car around.
I want to be a grown-up, but I know how important my education is.
Oh.
Well, congratulations.
You log a few months on that, you can work anywhere.
Im not looking anymore.
So what is this? That old joke- "Hell, Im telling everyone"?
No, Im calling on behalf of a young account man...
whom we love, but cant promote because Draper doesnt like him.
So youre looking for an account man?
You know you cant work here.
Ill be frank.
I got to get this kid out of here, and hes not going to call you himself.
Id love to present some concrete options to him when I push him out the door.
I just need leads. He doesnt have to land anything.
He must be pretty good if hes in your way.
Hes eager to please.
Handsome. His name is Bob Benson.
He has a blue bl*od connection to Brown Brothers Harriman.
Beloit, Wharton. Ill send over his personnel file.
And Ill send over a bill. Make it an even grand. Cash.
No, no, no, no.
- Whats going on in there? - Someones having a good time.
You do realize this is the best picture these people will ever take?
We were thinking about putting this old man in a wig...
because he looks so much like Ruth Gordon.
- Fill me in. - Thats a great idea.
The conceit is that its sh*t from the babys point of view.
No, no, lets do the ad for him.
Joan, come here.
Can I do it from here?
No.
So, Don, you are the camera and the baby.
We might have the end of the bassinet right at the front of the frame.
Maybe see some kicking toes under a blanket.
Should I get down a little lower?
No, thats fine.
Okay, its dark.
Fish-eye lens, youre the baby.
Just, "Whaa! Whaa!" You do that.
Whaa! Whaa! Whaa!
So theres a crowd. Eight or nine people.
Its the whole coven. And theres a crazy little old lady.
What you need is a mustard plaster.
And then theres this wrinkled old man.
You need a compress.
And then a Jewish neighbor lady.
How about a bowl of chicken soup?
Anyway, theres one more of those, maybe.
Then they all start crowding in on you.
And the Japanese takes a picture and the flash turns it white.
Then you see the beautiful, radiant young mother.
You dont need anyones help but St. Josephs.
Usually with things like this, it depends on you knowing the movie.
But I think this works on its own.
I told you it was good.
Thats a lot of people.
You need to feel the conspiracy.
You want me to come to casting?
Sure, but Im just gonna watch. It was all her.
Castings on the West Side. You should go.
Thats a lot of people.
I didnt want to dampen the enthusiasm, but the approved budget is $15,000.
Theres at least $35,000 in residuals alone here.
- What does St. Josephs say? - They havent seen the new budget.
So whos paying for casting?
We are.
But Ted seems confident theyll be good for it.
So he wants to spring it on them at the pre-pro meeting...
after were 10 grand out of pocket?
I dont know, Don. I dont tell him what to do.
And Diplomacy Club. I dont know if she told you in the interview...
but Henry thinks she can be an ambassador one day.
Its heartwarming to see such a proud mother.
Well, Sally going away is going to be difficult...
but, of course, I wanted it for myself way back when.
And in this day and age, its overwhelming to raise a young girl...
let alone be one.
Beautifully put.
Now, Sally, during your overnight and tomorrow in class...
I want you to keep in mind, and Im sure your mother would agree...
this is as much for you to find out about us...
as it is for us to find out about you.
Carla, could you fetch Millicent Turner from study hall?
You have fun.
- Ill be back in the morning around- - 2:30 would be perfect.
Thank you again.
Mr. Campbell, your mother is here to see you.
What are you doing here, Mother?
Josephine, you have my phone number.
This doesnt concern her.
Im here for my passport.
Im planning a voyage. And I spoke to Manolo.
I forbade you to see him.
Well, hes very upset about the way youre treating his friend Bob Benson.
That Spanish fly.
Why are you still in contact with him?
- I ran into him. - Where?
I dont remember.
Tell Manolo that I almost threw you down the steps when you brought up his friend.
Peter, I am still your mother.
I dont have your passport.
Im sure its expired like everything else you own. Josephine!
Youre endangering your position.
So this used to be the living room.
And, of course, you have to walk through my room to get to her room...
but we switch over at Christmas.
Id rather have my own room too.
Oh, hello.
You must be Sally.
Im Mandy. Move over.
Sallys family lives in Rye and Manhattan.
Let me guess, dads remarried, moms fat and sad.
No, theyre both remarried, but my dads wife is my age.
Well, Id like to feel sorry for you, but things are about to get worse.
Hmm. Dont you like it here?
Youre not allowed to talk anymore.
Our opinion is crucial to your acceptance.
And I cant believe no one told you that you were supposed to look after us.
You didnt bring a bottle or some cigarettes at least?
I probably have some money.
You think we need money?
You should call your mother. Tell her that youre useless.
I can get you anything you want.
She keeps talking.
Now what do we want?
How was casting?
It was interrupted by a phone call from St. Josephs.
Did you send over a budget?
Yes, but relax. I talked to them.
I played the bad guy. Theyll be fine.
No, they wont be.
They called me at casting to stop it.
Now I have to turn a no into a yes.
You were gonna have to do that anyway.
I couldnt even tell Peggy.
Did you tell her how expensive it was?
Its great work and you know it.
St. Josephs has been doing the same ad for 20 years.
Theyre bread and butter. Why did you pick them to push?
They kept asking me for their "plop plop fizz fizz."
And all of a sudden she comes up with this.
She can smell the CLIO, Don.
Remember your first big ad?
She has her heart set on it.
Its okay, Ted. I get it.
Youre right. Theyre coming in tomorrow. Just back me up on this?
Of course.
Ive got to go over that budget.
Yeah, she stayed skinny, but her breath smelled like vomit all the time.
I think its time for you girls to go to bed.
You hemmed your skirt.
My friend Sandy used a stapler.
Then by the time she went home, her legs were all scratched.
Stand still. Sally, you there?
Hello.
That was pretty fast.
Hey.
Im Mandy and this is Millicent.
Hold on, do you have a rope for him?
Millicent, go get him.
Go around the front.
Nice digs. Im Glen, by the way.
Did you have trouble finding us?
Rolos driven by before.
Then I just looked for Snoopy.
Do you want a cigarette?


No, but I wouldnt mind a drink.
Rolo brought something to smoke.
How you been? How are your folks?
Can we drink it straight?
I know how to make a Tom Collins.
- Shes too much. - Shes okay.
I dont think anyone saw us, but we should keep it quiet.
Im Rolo, by the way. Nice digs.
What about the proctor?
The housemothers a booze fiend.
Ill save some for her.
I want to get stoned.
I need a surface.
Heres looking up your old address.
Hello?
Look at the two of us, burning the midnight oil.
Something wrong? Did the messenger find you okay?
Im gonna need more than this kid Bob Bensons personnel record.
Might as well be written in steam.
What do you mean?
I dont even know if the name is real.
I dont know where he went to college, but it wasnt Beloit.
I tried a buddy at Wharton...
he said maybe hes just telling people Wharton...
so hes gonna check the whole University of Pennsylvania.
But its tough when I dont know if hes really 28 years old.
The most interesting is the Brown Brothers Harriman job.
You told me that.
I got that from him.
Well, I have a friend there.
Turns out they all remember Bobby.
Hes from West Virginia.
Parents are brother and sister or something.
He was a manservant for three years to a senior vice president.
He took him to Europe on the Queen Elizabeth.
Are you kidding me?
He had three references...
two nonworking numbers at K&E and a live one at Cunningham.
They said he just disappeared one day...
with an electric pencil sharpener and the Christmas card list.
So what does that mean?
Mostly that his only job opportunity...
was someplace dumb enough not to ask any questions...
and so far, thats just you guys.
Id offer to return the money, but I would file this under valuable information.
Yes, of course.
Ive never seen anything like this before.
I have.
Hes a heart patient. He hardly ever gets out of that apartment.
Well, we call that a DR number these days.
A DR number.
You can do that in bed, you know.
Thats right. The Detective division is on the third floor.
On, no, sir. All divisions- Homicide, Robbery, Burglary. Oh, whats that?
Yeah, I guess.
Since seventh grade.
The Ro is from Ronnie and the Lo is from Lowell.
So they just started calling me Rolo.
And cause he rolls a lot of joints.
Should I roll another?
Your friend bogarted the last one and she didnt get any.
Im really drunk.
You think Millicents okay?
She always freaks out.
What if she runs screaming down the hallway...
and she thinks her hair is on fire and shes screaming...
"Boy on the floor! Boy on the floor"?
Do you two know each other?
I think so, but who knows? I was reincarnated.
I came back as a fish.
You should read my diary.
Come on.
Nice sh*t.
Ive got good hands.
Do you play basketball?
Ive been with lots of girls. I know what Im doing.
What kind of music do you like?
I dont want to talk anymore.
Whats going on, Sally? You called us.
You made us drive all the way over here.
Suddenly you dont want to fool around? Are you frigid?
Glen. Glen, come out.
Hey, come on. Youve got to relax.
What do you want?
He wont leave me alone.
What the hell, Rolo? I told you shes like my sister.
I think youre full of shit, man.
You just wanted the good one.
What is going on?
He tried to force me.
What? Damn it, Rolo.
Shes a lying little tease.
Thats bullshit.
Keep it down.
Get off me, Bishop.
Are you suicidal? Im your ride home.
Hell be fine. I got to go. I dont want to hitch.
Are you all right?
Nice meeting you.
You too.
Im sorry.
Keep in touch.
How do you know him?
We grew up together.
You like trouble, dont you?
Good morning.
Are you joining us?
Ted wanted more firepower.
I thought Id pitch in.
I dont understand what happened.
Residuals. Cant let them sneak up on you.
Itll be fine.
We always win this one.
Well, I see everythings in order, including our cookies from Ferraras.
Byron, you remember Peggy Olson.
- Mr. Poole, nice to see you again. - Byron.
And Don Draper, of course, our other creative director.
Yes, and Im sorry about the phone call, but, well, it was a bit of a surprise.
But youre here and we are going to set you at ease.
Now Ted and Peggy will take you through the creative process...
that resulted in this ingenious spot.
I know what it is. I bought it the day I heard it. I just paid a lot less for it.
Well, as a concept becomes more developed, expenses can mount.
We want to do this right.
The cost is still a fraction of the business we believe it will generate.
Ted, with all due respect, its not your job to promise sales.
Its your job to deliver work for the budget agreed to.
It turned out to be more people than we thought.
Thats why we sent the budget over.
We didnt want there to be any surprises.
But this is worth the money.
But this is a surprise.
We agreed to 15,000 and its 50.
You said specifically that you wanted something contemporary...
with a sense of humor...
something that wouldnt make young parents feel like old people.
This does that and more.
Thats not a reason.
Well, it should be.
We have enough of a history that you should trust my judgment.
No, I want a reason. Im entitled.
You know the raft of shit I caught when this budget came in?
Mr. Plough called me.
Uh, I hate to interrupt.
I think, Byron, I know what you want to hear.
And it has nothing to do with the sh**ting days or the cast...
because youve had a long and fruitful, creative relationship together.
I think, and correct me if Im wrong...
that when you say you want a reason...
you want to know why we would push you like this.
It would help.
Well, the truth is that I dont think Ted wants to say.
Cause its, well...
its a little bit personal.
In fact, its very personal.
Im not sure I know what you mean.
Yes, you do.
Are you okay, Ted?
I, uh-
Its okay.
Tell him, Ted.
You dont want to say anything?
All right. Ill tell him.
Its hard for Ted to say...
but this was Frank Gleasons last idea.
Really?
Yes.
Im afraid weve gotten a little sentimental.
Damn. You should have told me that.
I guess I was- I dont know. I, uh-
The factor didnt seem relevant except to us. I, um...
didnt want to lean on that.
Frank was a hell of a guy. Best I can do is 25.
I dont care if you make these characters out of cardboard...
or turn them into cartoons, you got to reduce the cast.
Thats all you get.
I understand.
Ill show you out.
You should come to Piping Rock this Sunday.
Get in a few holes before all the grass dies.
Well see.
Was that really necessary?
Leave us alone.
What was that?
That was the best I could do.
Do you want me to tell him the truth?
What are you talking about?
Youre not thinking with your head.
That was your solution? Try and embarrass me?
Youre embarrassing yourself.
I know your little girl has beautiful eyes...
but that doesnt mean you give her everything.
That has nothing to do with it.
Come on, weve all been there. I mean, not with Peggy, but-
Dont say that about her.
Ted, youre kidding yourself.
Everybody sees it. Just ask your secretary.
Your judgment is impaired.
Youre not thinking with your head.
Good morning, Bob.
How you doing, boss?
I thought for certain you would have brought me a coffee today.
You want me to go get one?
Ive always wondered how you were so expertly servile.
But now I know. It used to be your profession.
What do you want?
Well, for one thing, I wanted you to stop smiling.
You got it.
Ive been awake all night wondering what you do when youre found out.
This must have happened before.
I dont know what youre talking about.
- Who hired you? - You did.
When?
I met with Ken. You walked in, complimented my tie and walked out.
It was the best day of my life.
Well, your fraud is irrefutable.
Can I have a days head start?
Can you give me that at least after all Ive done for you?
Youve done more for me than Ive done for you.
Spectacular.
You dont respond well to gratitude.
So youre just going to run? I dont believe you.
It terrifies me what you could do in a day.
No, Bob, youre going to get the benefit of the fact...
that Ive been here before.
I dont know how people like you do it.
Youre certainly better at it than I am at whatever I do.
But I would like to think that I have learned not to tangle with your kind of animal.
I dont understand.
Where you are and who you are is not my concern.
I surrender.
So what does that mean to me?
I want you to graciously accept my apologies.
Work alongside me, but not too closely.
Again, I dont understand.
Yes, you do.
Im off-limits.
And please, can you find a way to get your friend out of my mothers life?
You know shes demented.
Manolo doesnt like women.
Make sure.
Sally.
What?
So you got what you wanted and now you think you can be rude.
Fine.
Im not going to tell you what Mrs. Beresford said to me...
when you were saying good-bye.
She talked to you?
She said you were curious and bright...
and received glowing reports from all concerned.
But?
She said a girl like you coming from this family will have plenty of choices...
and she hopes you choose them.
Oh.
Now get me a cigarette and give me some details.
You want one, dont you?
Go ahead.
Id rather have you do it in front of me than behind my back.
Im sure your father has given you a beer.
My father has never given me anything.
Did you tell him that I need to see him?
He went home.
When?
Right after I told him you needed to see him.
I know what you did, I just dont know why you did it.
Calm down.
You want to offer me a drink? Pretend like youre helping a little more?
Close the door.
Oh, of course. You deserve privacy.
Look, theres still enough money for the ad. Well make it work.
Stop hiding behind the ad.
I know what you did.
I saved both of you. How do you think it looks?
You hate that he is a good man.
Hes not that virtuous.
Hes just in love with you.
Well, you k*ll him.
You k*ll the ad.
You k*ll everything. You can stop now.
Im just looking out for the agency.
Youre a monster.
