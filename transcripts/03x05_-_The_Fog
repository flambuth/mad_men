I was expecting the Piersons as well,but theyre not coming. Please.
My goodness. Of course. Here, take mine.
I appreciate that both of you are here.
What happened?
The children were at the water fountainduring gym
and Sally told Becky Piersonshe should save some for the fish,
and Becky ignored her,
and Sally hit the back of her headand her face went into the spigot.
And then Becky went after her...Hair pulling, scratching.
She didnt need stitches in the end,I understand?
This girl, this Becky Pierson,Sally told me shes a bruiser.
Shes heavy.
The children poke pencils into her sideswhen shes sitting
- because they think she cant feel it.- Sally doesnt do that, does she?
No.
But this bad behavior is new.
I know that youre expecting a child,but she already has a little brother.
I guess what Im asking is,has anything changed at home recently?
My... My father passed away. Last week.
The week before... Two weeks now.
- I feel terrible for bringing that up for you.- Well, it has not been easy.
Is this Grandpa Gene were talking about?That poor thing.
- Sally didnt mention it?- Why didnt you call us or send a note?
I dont think she missed a day.Did she go to the funeral?
- Why would we put her through that?- I dont think children belong in graveyards.
No, of course not.
Now I realize why she was askingall those questions
- about Medgar Evers m*rder.- She was?
Im sorry.
- I have to use the ladies room again.- We can talk about this another time.
No, Im not as upset as I look.I cant help this.
- I am mortified.- Its not a good time.
No, and it really should be, shouldnt it?
Sally does need more attention.Shes grieving.
There is a very special painto losing someone at that age.
I dont know if you can understand that.
I can.
Mrs. Draper, I was just talkingto your husband and this really can wait.
Are you sure?
Because I just want to put it behind us.
I really just want everything to be okaywhen the baby comes.
Its going to be a beautiful summer.
"Tipped a barman: 75 cents.Hat-check tip at bar: 50 cents.
"Cab to restaurant: $1.12.Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents.
"Dinner at Hausners: $19.44."
Its better to have a bit of Don Draperthan no Don Draper at all.
Id like that in writing.
It seems strange that the two of youwent on the same overnight trip
and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.
If I were lying,wouldnt I have made it a round number?
- Not that Dons lying.- I signed his receipts, didnt I?
Which brings us to the undocumentedportion of my assessment.
The amount of pencils, pens, pads,paper and postage
that are currently being consumedsuit a company four times our size.
It has also been brought to my attentionthat a credenza has disappeared,
a theft that I believenecessitates a conspiracy.
People forget that Karl Marxwas the greatest economist who ever lived,
and whatever you think of his solution,the problem he posed
was about the catastrophicup-and-down of the marketplace.
Tell the folks at Admiralthat Karl Marx says everythings okay.
Boom and bust. Bull and bear."I need a TV." "I have a TV."
Damn it, Paul,someone helped Ken cherry-pick
all of Burts successful accountsand Ive been left with the dogs.
- Admiral is not a dog.- Sales are flat. Its all over their memos.
And now I have to look them in the eyewith nothing. Except maybe new creative.
Stop it.
Now youre interested. There are someareas of growth, and I mean literally, areas.
Atlanta, Oakland, Chicago,Detroit, Newark, DC.
Great jazz cities.
And I left out St. Louis and Kansas City,also growing.
- What does that mean?- Great jazz musicians?
Seriously, is it possible that these Admiralsare being bought by negroes?
Lois caught her scarfputting paper in the Xerox.
Maybe when Joan leavesI can finally get rid of her.
Can you pretend like youre backin the media department
and tell me what this says to you?Look at the cities.
Is it possible that negroesare out-buying other people two-to-one?
You could jump to that conclusion,I suppose.
Did you hear about Lois?You got a winner there, Kinsey.
- Did you see it?- I did.
So whats everybody doing tonight?Baby. Married. Kinsey?
Do you want to go to the Mets game?Tickets and a watch.
- Why, thank you, Birds Eye.- Does the watch say "Birds Eye" on it?
No, it says, "Hamilton Electric. "What time is it? What time isnt it?
- Admiral is happy. Were happy.- Theyre not happy!
"Morris, comma, in referenceto retooling the factory
"for London Fog childrensand young adults... "
I thought Id bring you the minutesto the meeting, since you had to run off.
Youre wasting paper.
Id have to make 1,000 to keep upwith your department.
They waste paper becausethey throw out bad ideas.
They waste paper because they use itto sop up spilled drinks,
right after their mid-afternoon naps.
You came here becausewe do this better than you,
and part of that is letting our creativesbe unproductive until they are.
Pennies make poundsand pounds make profits.
I dont want to talk to you this way.Ive tried it before and it never works.
- Youre not usually this emotional.- You want to make money?
Start getting your nails dirtywith Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.
Clients love to pay for mediaand creative needs pencils.
I suppose I hadnt necessarilythought of it that way.
And lay off of expense accounts.
Think of the mens morale,not just your own.
Youve obviously seenBridge on the River Kwai.
Ive seen everything.You have my ticket stubs.
Your uncle Herman is on the line.He wont leave a message.
Uncle Herman?My goodness, is Aunt Alice all right?
- Who is this?- Its Peter. Dotties boy. You called me.
- Its Duck. Duck Phillips.- Duck.
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.I didnt want to set off any alarm bells.
My name is Herman, you know that.
Except that I actually have an Uncle Hermanand hes 91.
Thats a sick joke. I apologize.Its been too long.
I dont know if you heard,but Im at Grey now.
Whats that like?
People walking around the hallsall the time, laughing their heads off?
Were going to have lunch, you know.
I dont know, Duck.It doesnt sound like a good idea.
Campbell, this is beyond"No hard feelings. "
I wont waste your time.Havent I always been on your side?
- When?- Ill have my girl call your girl.
Ill say its Clorox.
Hello? Anyone home?
Ill get it. Hello?
- Mr. Draper?- Yes.
This is Suzanne Farrell, Sallys teacher.Im not interrupting dinner, am I?
- No.- I just felt I should call and apologize
about our meeting this morning.
Why?
Well, I...
What I mean is,my father died when I was eight
and I might have overdone it,relating to Sally in that way.
I didnt mean to upset your wife, and...
I guess I can get a little caught up in thingsand lose perspective.
I dont know why Im calling.Im embarrassing myself.
No, youre fine.
- If theres anything I can do...- Don?
Betts!
Thanks for the call.
- Its time to go.- Okay, were going. Let me get my keys.
Theyre in your hand.
Francine took the kids. Who was that?
No one.
If youre parked in emergency,youll have to move soon.
First, lets make sure its not a false alarm.
- This is my third time.- We sent you home before?
No, third baby.
Your jobs done.The solariums down the hall to the right.
Hang in there, Betts.
I came in early to cover for a friend,
so theres a chance Ill see youthe whole way through.
Daddy!
You can scream and yellas much as you want in this hallway,
- but were about to pass the nursery.- Of course.
Excuse me.
I know its silly, but I seemto be having trouble with this pen.
- I believe its empty.- I gotta go.
Are you planningto give the baby the breast?
- No.- Last time you ate?
Lunch. Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.
Pineapple? What were you thinking?Anything else, sweetheart?
- Life Savers.- Has your water broken?
My water never breaks.When will Dr. Aldridge be here?
Joseph Waddell?
- Im Dennis Hobart.- Thats good to know.
I havent seen anybody in an hour.Whats going on?
- Well, weve had a shift change.- My wife, Pam, Pamela Hobart.
Shes fine. The babys breech.Were calling in a specialist.
- What?- Didnt somebody get your permission?
Damn it, what is with you people?I dont know a damn thing!
Please dont raise your voice.
Now, I apologize,but we need your permission.
- Do whatever you have to do.- Well update you religiously. Promise.
This is not how I pictured it.Wheres all the backslapping?
You know, I brought this becauseI thought itd be a party in here.
- Its not, but Ill have one.- Right now?
Whenever you want.
I left work this morning.Ive been here all day.
I am so bored.
I even called in.Like the prison cant run without me.
- You done this before?- Twice.
- And yet I never thought to bring a bottle.- Well, what are we supposed to do?
My daughter took forever.I remember being pretty worked up.
And the nurse said, "Dont forget.
"Your wifes in the boat.Youre on the shore. "
- The other one a boy?- Yes.
You throw the ball around?
Not enough.
All right, Mrs. Draper,Im going to need you to get on the bed
so I can prepare you for delivery.This part should be familiar.
Ill shave youand then give you a quick low enema.
Well, the good news is, time has stopped.
Id like to have a gold watch one day,but I cant, you know?
You dont wantto have anything on you like that.
Would they attack you?
I knew it was just a matter of timebefore you started with the questions.
I bet you have a nightmare where you endup in Sing Sing, right? Everybody does.
- I do.- So whats it like?
Youre outnumbered,but you got the power.
Kind of like being a king.
- Except your subjects want to k*ll you.- Maybe, but they dont,
cause they know Im dangerous,and I got a badge, which they respect.
How do they know youre dangerous?
Well, theyre not all bad. Theres extremes.
Weve got death rowand then weve got the baseball team.
In 29, they played the Yankees.
Everybody in stripes.
Youre a funny one.
I tell a lot of jokes at work.You hear some doozies.
I have to watch what I do when I leave work,be careful not to bring it home.
Especially with a kid, right?
Just yesterday I was in A block
and I thought,"Every single one of these animals,
"their mother had them, they were a baby. "
And I think, "There they are,on the other side of the fence. "
And you know what? Every one of themwould blame their mom and dad.
- Thats a bullshit excuse.- Thats true, Don.
You have little veins.Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.
- Do you need to call someone else in?- Its in.
The medication will help with the painand put you in a twilight sleep.
- Where is Dr. Aldridge?- Hes in the city.
He went to Mama Leonesfor his anniversary. Isnt that sweet?
Is he drinking?
Cause my Aunt Emma,her doctor was drunk,
and he ruined her bladder.
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician,is on duty and will fill in.
- I dont want him. I dont know him.- Hes our top man.
I want Dr. Aldridge.
You have absolutely nothingto worry about.
I dont want another doctor.I want my doctor.
Sit back. Youre at 5 centimeters.
Thats halfway from here to the Hebridesand other mountain ranges,
which we are currently studyingin chapter 12.
The doctor will be here and there.
The Hebrides are islands.
Try it now.
Thank you, Sister.
What do you make her for? Sixteen?
Pam was screaming at me in the car.
- I dont think thats unusual.- Thats my girl in there.
If something happens to her,
I just dont know what Id do.
And then thered be that baby.How could I love that baby?
Our worst fears lie in anticipation.
Youre so sure about that?
- I want to go home, you bitch!- Please relax!
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!Wheres Don?
- Hes in the waiting room.- No, she cant hear you.
The hell I cant. Where is he? Wheres Don?
- Hes in the waiting room.- Bullshit.
Hes never where you expect him to be.
Have you seen him?Have you been with him?
Seven centimeters. Shes starting transition.
Someone call him. I dont want to be here.
Push the Demerol, 25 milligrams.
Im just a housewife.Why are you doing this to me?
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations.You have a little baby boy.
- Oh, my God.- Your wife and your baby are doing fine.
Can I go in? Can I see her?
Not right now. She lost a lot of bl*odand had a transfusion.
- What? Please, I have to see her.- Please, shes in recovery, resting.
But you can go to the nursery and look inat your son. Its just down the hall.
Thank you.
A baby boy.
- Congratulations.- Youre all right, Don.
Im sure yours is gonna be good, too.
You know what? I know it.
Thanks, Dennis.
Youre an honest guy.Believe me. Im an expert.
Go see your baby.
Why do they put up with us?You know, we dont deserve it.
This is a fresh start.I dont know whos up there,
so Im saying this to you.Im gonna be better.
Im gonna be a better man.
Tell me you heard me.
I heard you.
Dont fight the urge to bear down.
I cant. I cant. I cant do it.
Either you can do it or we will,but its going to come out some way.
Daddy?
- Who are you?- Its me.
I dont know you.
Its me, Elizabeth.
You do know me.
- Okay, so its me.- What are you doing here?
- I had to go away.- Well, dont you miss me?
Of course. Listen.
Nobody knows Im here, okay?
Am I dying?
Ask your mother. Tell her, Ruthie.
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.Youll catch flies.
I left my lunch pail on the busand Im having a baby.
You see what happens to peoplewho speak up?
Be happy with what you have.
Youll be okay. Youre a house cat.
Youre very importantand you have little to do.
- Shes beautiful.- Its a boy.
You look terrible.
- How do you feel?- I need to put my face on.
You look beautiful, Betts.
- Gene.- What did you say?
His name is Eugene.
We dont have to decide that now.
Gene.
Did you get any sleep?
No, and I dont expect tofor the next six months.
I wasnt sure where to put it all.
Mr. Drapers office. Please hold.Its Mr. Sterling. Are you in?
- Roger.- Dada.
- Where are you?- Down the hall.
Hows Betty? She perform like a champ?
- She did.- I need his initials.
Janes gonna put them on the backof her yacht or something for him.
No name yet.
Theres a lot of guystwiddling their thumbs down in art.
- Why were you in the art department?- Lane was.
Apparently, were all backed up. No onewill move forward without your approval.
- I missed half a day.- Well, Betty had the baby, not you.
- Ill see what I can do.- Good.
That guys a tick.See you at the traffic meeting.
Can I get some coffee?
You know what its like in that office.No one ever buys me lunch.
- I like the turtleneck.- Really?
- Come. Join us.- What is she doing here?
Dont worry about it. I know what Im doing.


- No, you dont.- Have a nosh.
Two months at Greyand youre already having a nosh?
I didnt know until I got here.
Look, I woke up one dayand had a realization.
- You two have a secret relationship.- What? Thats ridiculous.
Come on. The way you handledthat Freddy Rumsen thing
so that she could move up?
Ive been doing this a long time.I know what I saw.
- Thats not what happened.- You can be modest if you want to,
but that kind of focused ambitionis rare in advertising.
Thank you.
I want to take you both with meto the promised land.
At Grey,an account man is expected to have ideas,
and creatives are expected to be geniuses.
Youll be sitting on velvet pillows,showered with riches, awards.
- Were not going anywhere. Well, she can.- Do we have to go together?
Pete, I know you have ideasand youre a risk-taker.
Sterling Cooperis never going to reward that.
Well, thank you. Anything else?
Dont be a baby. You should be takingmeetings like this twice a week.
If you want to woo me,youll have to buy me my own lunch.
- Maybe I should leave, too.- Why would you do that?
Youre so talented.You should strike while the irons hot.
- What does that mean?- It means the skys the limit.
No mortgage, no family.
Youre a freewheeling career galwith great ideas. Am I wrong?
- I dont know.- This is your time, Peggy.
Let me ask you something, Hollis.What type of TV do you have?
- An RCA.- Really?
Color? Why did you get it?
- To watch TV.- But why an RCA specifically?
I didnt see any difference, I guess.
Sixteen. Good afternoon, gentlemen.
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral.Ive done research.
I have an RCA.
- So, do your friends buy Admirals?- Im sorry, sir. I cant really say.
Look. This is important and Id really liketo have an honest conversation with you.
I dont want to get into trouble.
- Its just us. Its just Hollis and...- Mr. Campbell.
Do you think Im a bigot?
I just want to knowwhy you bought your TV.
- I dont know. I dont remember.- Its your TV. Its a big purchase.
- I dont even watch the damn thing.- Really? Why not?
Why should I? Weve got bigger problemsto worry about than TV, okay?
Youre thinking about thisin a very narrow way.
The idea is that everyone is goingto have a house, a car, a television...
The American dream.
- Its my job.- Every job has its ups and downs.
You dont watch baseball?I dont believe you.
- What are you doing out of bed?- I smelled something.
- What are you making?- A snack. You want some?
- I didnt know you could cook.- Mommys much better at it.
- Are you looking for a chick?- I am.
Miss Farrell told us about thatwhen we went to the farm.
But she says those eggscan never become a chicken,
- even though they come out of a chicken.- Whys that?
Because theyre from the store.
And you know what else?If you hold an egg up and it has veins in it,
- you can shake it, then eat it.- Really?
Its called addling.
Is the baby gonna livein Grandpa Genes room?
Its not Grandpa Genes room.Its the babys room.
- I thought it was gonna be a girl.- Well, I thought you were gonna be a boy.
Not all surprises are bad.
- Everythings gonna be fine.- Thats what Miss Farrell said.
Well, then I guess it must be true.
Burt Petersons firing was undignified.Building security. Thats all Ill say.
Confirm a couple of rumors.Did he throw a desk chair against a window
only to have it bounce backand knock him over?
Not that I know of.
Did he make a number two in a file cabinet?
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.So, Harry here is an expert in media.
- Television. The air, not the sets.- Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.
- We know that.- But as we studied your indices,
we realized that theyre not flat everywhere.
In fact, among negroes,sales are actually growing.
- We know that, too.- You do?
No, of course you do.
These are your numbers, but I thinkweve discovered an interesting strategy.
This is Ebony.
By negroes, for negroes.
Jet. Space in these magazines costs far lessthan what you currently spend.
Daily newspapers that go just to this marketfor pennies on the dollar.
And?
Shift a portion of the media budgetfrom lower-indexing white areas
to this market, where it can do more good.
They already like it and we can make thembuy more by increasing the exposure.
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone
would make you the same profitas a 2% increase system-wide.
And ads on television geared to this marketand white markets
- will have double the effect.- A n*gro ad and a white ad?
So, Campbell,youre making twice the ads for us now.
No, do them together. Integrate it.
- I dont think thats legal.- Of course its legal.
Look, this conversation is not worth having.
Whos to say that negroesarent buying Admiral televisions
because they thinkwhite people want them?
- Miss Olson is here to see you.- Send her in.
Sorry.
I know he doesnt need clothes,but dont return it.
Im the youngest. I never had anything new.
- You didnt have to do that.- I did.
No one told methey were all going in on it together.
I heard you were back at work,but now I wonder if thats true.
I invited you in.
I dont know if this is the best time.I dont know. Its kind of serious.
Ive been thinking about my situation here,
and Im so grateful to youfor all youve done.
I just...
Well, you know, Im paid very little.
My secretary doesnt respect me becauseI make $71 more a week than she does.
Maybe we need to get youa cheaper secretary.
Paul Kinsey does the same work that I do,and not as well sometimes.
And I dont know if you read it in the paper,but they passed a law
where women who do the same workas men will get paid the same thing.
Equal pay.
Its not a good time.
Its not a good time for me, Don.Do you know how expensive this city is?
Its not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.Im fighting for paperclips around here.
Third time. It must be old hat.
- Youre gonna be fine, Peggy.- I look at you and I think,
- "I want what he has. "- Really?
You have everything, and so much of it.
I suppose thats probably true.
What do you want me to say?
I dont think I could have been any clearer.
You see whats been going on herethe last six months?
What if this is my time?
Hey.
- Where are you going?- To the ladies room. You want to join me?
- Did you tell Don about Duck?- Thats none of your business.
Sure, they hear youre shopping around,theyll want you more, but me?
Im sharing my job with Kenny.Im already redundant.
You have relationships with your clients.Thats leverage.
- Did you say something?- Its my decision, Pete.
Your decisions affect me.
If it isnt Martin Luther King.I should dropkick you off the roof.
Admiral Television has no interestin becoming a colored television company.
But they are. It seems illogical to me
that they would reject an opportunityto make more money.
Then again, Im in advertising.
This is a sensitive issue.Businesses hate that.
Let me put it in account terms.
Are you aware of the number of hand jobsIm gonna have to give?
Am I being taken off the account?
Im going to have to pretendI had you k*ll!
Sales are flat. I had to do something.
I dont know if anyones ever told youthat half the time
this business comes down to,"I dont like that guy. "
Are we done with the flogging?
Never as good as you think its gonna be.
If I may. Bert, Roger,
it does seem as though theres moneyto be made in the n*gro market.
Obviously not with Admiral,
but I dont think it would be wrong of usto pursue it in some way.
Really?
Ive just moved here.Im a stranger in a strange land,
but I can tell youtheres definitely something going on.
Well look into it. You can go.
- Were here!- Shes here!
- Mommy! Daddy!- Mommy! Mommy!
Welcome, welcome!
Mommy!
- Careful.- Here, let me take him.
I missed you so much.
Wait till you see your fridge.
If theres a power outage,you can feed the entire street for a month.
- Hi, baby. Im your brother, Bobby.- Remember, you have to be careful.
How was it?
You know. It was all a fog.
Youre making a mistakenot forcing Carla to stay.
Shes been away from her family.And I can manage.
- I know some girls.- You want something to eat?
- Sure.- I got it. Come on.
