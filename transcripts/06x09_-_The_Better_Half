Previously on Mad Men...
Youre going tohave a love scene.
And between you, me andsoon a national audience,
its more of a love affair.
Oh, my goodness.
I dont want to live onthe Upper East Side.
Why?
I saw us raising our kids in a placewith more different kinds of people.
We created a human life.
When you told meabout the merger,
I hoped he wouldrub off on you.
Obviously, youre on his side.
Why did you do it alloff their sides?

It tastes betterbecause its more expensive.
Its the premium brandand its priced accordingly.
Price is irrelevantbecause the question is
does it tastebetter than butter?
Butter is actually fresh.Margarine is indestructible.
Hes right because hes onlycomparing different margarines
and margarine has a 70%market share over butter.
But its hard to sayany brand is luxury
when although Fleischmannsis the most expensive
and Blue Bonnet,owned by the same company,
is the least expensive,the difference is only pennies.
45 cents a poundis the highest.
29 is the lowest.Thats 50% more expensive.
Fleischmanns is Chivas Regal.
Still half the price of butter.
- Its Budweiser.- But whats the market share?
I just said its muchhigher than butter.
Seeing as I havethe ear of the client,
its my recommendationwe go on taste alone.
Peggy!
Don, I agree with you.
Youre in the marketbuying margarine.
Okay.
What goes through your mind?
Mouthwatering, savory,delicious taste?
Or mouthwatering, savory,delicious taste and price?
Id buy the cheaper one.
Theres one for 45 centsa pound and one for 29.
Which one do you thinkis gonna taste better?
Its a terrible gamble to tell a clientthat their product is expensive.
Shh.Let her answer.
I dont know.
They both sound good.
Really?
Does everyone agree with yours?
Its not his and mine.Everyone has an opinion.
We havent heard it,but Im sure they do.
I like Dons.
What did Harry say?
I feel strongly both ways.
Theyre both so good.
Id probably ask someone to runthem by the client on the sly.
The meetings tomorrow.
You know what, Don?Lets go with yours.
Nah, Im not evengonna be there.
You should go with whateveryoure most comfortable with.
Could you get me anothercopy of that research?
I want to make it bigon a board.
Did you see that?He didnt even turn around.
- Yep.- Oh, it speaks.
Come on, I wasnt gonnaget in the middle of that.
You suddenly dumber than Peggy?
So youre content in silence?
Im content with reality.
You know what this place lookslike to the outside world?
A mess. We donteven have a name.
- Were the 27 Yankees.- Says who?
Pete, you want to getyour balls tickled?
Go see a headhunter.
Are you leaving?
Look, when things settle down,Im gonna be a partner.
For the time being, its nice to knowthat the waters warm out there.
Did you lose something?
Yes.
I was looking for...
how do you say, a pento write something down.
Oh, well, the deskis littered with them.
Would you like a drink?
Certainly, Colette.
Although this ismy husbands office.
I should be offering you one.
It is no trouble at all.
Were a lot alike.
Were both interestedin things that belong to me.
I dont know whatyoure talking about.
I dont know whatyour relationship is
with my husband, but its over.
Cut. Lets cleanup in there and back up.
Megan, sweetheart, what areyou doing on the floor?
The script saidto spill the drink.
It doesnt say to clean it up.
I just thought...
Your sister Corinneis the maid.
Youre Colette right now.Shes blonde, classy.
We need you to makethese women different, honey.
Lets take itfrom the top, ladies.
Dont worry about it.
I think Phyllis left for the day, butI never saw the boards for tomorrow.
- Stan has them.- Ah.
- What are you working on?- Royal Hawaiian.
- Hows that going?- Im sure you will tell me.
I will.
Ill look at it very carefully
and then Ill formulatean educated opinion.
You should try it sometime.Its what professionals do.
Don.
Youve been debatingthat for weeks.
- You both have a point.- Im not paying you to be a diplomat.
Well, youre bothmore experienced than me.
I dont knowthat my opinion matters.
Your opinion matters.
Now what do you thinkis the best way to go?
- Its somewhere in the middle.- No, Peggy.
Theres a rightand theres a wrong.
How could that be?
What youre really saying istheres you and theres him.
And I dont know how I became in chargeof turning this into a collaboration.
Isnt that your job?
Youre both demandingand youre both pigheaded.
Youre the same personsometimes.
The difference is thathes interested in the idea
and youre interestedin your idea.
Hes interested in his idea.Dont let him fool you.
Well, he never makes mefeel this way.
He doesnt know you.
Henry said you were leaving.
He just had to makeone phone call,
which turned out to be two.
Full house, I see.
He should be off in a minute.
Well, hes a lucky man.But not as lucky as me,
because I wanted to bealone with you all night.
Hell be out in a minute.
I dont think you heard.
I want to be alonewith you all night.
Mr. Dell, I havethree children.
I dont care.
No, look at me.
Can you believeIve had three children?
How was your evening, Stew?
Raised a lot of money.
Darling, shall we?
- Whats going on?- There was an incident.
Oh, my God!
- They hurt you.- Im fine, honey.
He was getting off the subwayand two guys stabbed him.
- What?- Hey, I dont want to worry her, man.
Im sorry, but Im tryingto get it straight.
And, frankly, she should knowso she can keep up her defense.
- Jesus, what happened?- Are we done here?
For a reporter,this is missing detail.
And if youd waitedat the hospital,
as you were instructed,wed be done.
But for some reason you didnt.
I filled out the form.
Come on, were they coloredor Puerto Rican?
Or white?
Im from Brooklyn and Ialways keep my eyes down.
Could you describe the shoes?
Look, both of us have doneour civic duty.
So, respectfully,I think you should go.
Id get one of these.
Good evening, maam.
Can you believethose questions?
- Fascist pig!- Shut up, Abe!
You dont knowwhat they look like?
You have a photographic memory.
Peg, Im not gonnagive him an excuse
to shake down every kid thatwalks through this neighborhood.
What about the onethat stabbed you?
This is a f*cking police state
and were gonnahave to fight, okay?
They did it in Prague.They did it in Paris.
And, believe it or not, weregonna have to do it here, too.
That doesnt meanprotecting criminals.
Listen, baby, its my right totell whomever whatever I want.
But you can keep talking becauseeverything you say is going in my story.
What are you talking about?
Its just fascinating,the attitudes Im encountering.
But why would you sidewith the cops?
I dont know.
I read about this.
You obviously hada traumatic experience
not unlike combat.
So Im going to let you dowhatever youre doing.
Dont patronize me.
Those kids have no otherrecourse in this system.
- Theyre animals.- They were brought here by slave ships.
Well, I wasbrought here by you.
I dont care if I take a loss,Im gonna sell this sh*thole.
Youre worried about meand I love you for it.
Now, I dont thinkI can type with this thing.
Get my Olympia. Help meget some of this down.
Im going to bed.
This is nice.
Its Thursday.Told you I was making dinner.
Sit down.
How was your day?
How was yours?
Hmm.
It was...
Ugh, it was terrible.
I dont even knowif I want to talk about it.
Whats for dinner?
I think they hate me.
They just gave youa second part.
I feel like an idiotbecause they keep telling me
they cant tellthe twins apart.
I think Im playing themvery differently.
Its not likeits never been done before.
Exactly.
I told Mel I didnt wantto be a cliché.
Then he starts rapping about howtheyre two halves of the same person
and they want the same thing, but theyretrying to get it in different ways.
Listen, would you mind if wejust go in and turn on the set?
Im really not hungry.
Did you have a bad day?
Im just tired.
Go lay down.Ill clean up.
I already packed your bagfor Bobbys camp.
Tomorrows another day.
John, could you give ussome privacy?
Was the evening a success?
You tell me.
Well, I--
I found it fascinating as usual
watching you work your magic.
And while you were watching me,
everyone was watching you,werent they?
Stewart did everythingbut grab your ass.
I didnt notice.
What did he say to you?
I dont want to getanyone in trouble.
Word for word.
He said he wantedto be alone with me.
What else?
All night.
Daddy, I dont want himrunning on the steps.
Why not?Kids are supposed to run.
Ellery, come down.
We dont have any stepsin the apartment.
Hes not good at them.
So what do you think, girls?
See any resemblance?
Hes very handsome.
So, Ellery, take a good look.
Whos your type?
Hello, Margaret.
Ill tell you mine later.
Its nice to see you.
Oh, hes precious.How old is he?
Hes four. Hes having aspecial day with Pop-pop.
Were going to the zooand maybe the movies.
So its just a regular workday.
Dont fill him full of junk.
Cant promise that.
Wave good-bye, swabby.
Were shoving off.
How many timeshave you met with Harry?
Too many. Dont wastemy time like Crane.
Im a headhunter,not a fan club.
Fine, lets talk about me.
Lets talk about Burt Peterson.
I got him a vicepresidency at McCann.
If he keeps his head down,hes set for life.
But the merger was fresh.I dont know your situation.
You werent very straighton the phone.
You think theyre gonnacut you loose?
How come you didntget yourself a job?
Thats a Yankee wrinkle.
- You interested in my business?- No.
Well, if we sat downa couple of months ago,
this would have beena different conversation.
Nothings changed.Ill show you my Rolodex.
Its not that. Its your lack of arole in the management structure.
Sterling Cooper Draper PryceCutler Gleason and Chaough?
Who the hells in charge?
Two of those menare as dead as doornails.
Theres still a lot of chiefsand only a couple of Indians.
And a lot of questions.
What the hellhappened with Vicks?
So...
paint me a new portrait.
Im glad you said that.
How about seeing thingsfrom the client side?
Theres a head of marketing job inWichita that youd be perfect for.
Anything back here on Earth?
You know,
Ive always liked you,Campbell,
so forgive me for saying this,
but if you do a little better,I can do a lot better.
I dont knowwhat else I can do.
Ive been you
and I went on interviews
and I realized I was fillingthe room with desperation.
Five cents worthof free advice.
Youve got to spendless time in this place
and more at home.
This is a reluctant necessity.
My mothers run amok.
Pete, one dayI looked in the mirror
and I realized I had regretsbecause I didnt understand
the wellspringof my confidence.
Gin?
My family.
My family is a constantdistraction.
You better manage that
or youre not gonnamanage anything.
Hey, buddy.
Can you help me?
Im occupiedat the moment, sir.
Hello there.
Oh.Are you lost, too?
Not yet.
Im trying to get some gas.
Lady asked for directions.
Fill er up with regular.
Wheres Henry?
Hes coming tomorrow.
Im surprised youwere able to get away.
Where are you staying?
Somewhere over here.
Just go down here. Stayon here a mile and a half
till you get to the big mill.Make a left.
Go back through towntill the railroad tracks.
Hang a right over the bridge
and then you cometo the little mill.
Do any of the roads have names?
Follow me.
Fleischmanns just called.
See? You were worriedfor nothing.
Well, they just requested some morerecent figures on market share.
Ill handle it.
Peggy, may I speak with you?Go ahead.
What the hell were youdoing back there?
You didnt want me to talk.
I didnt talk. That was the plan.Did you want me to talk?
- No, you touched my hand.- What?
When you handed me the board.
What?No, I didnt.
Yes, you did. And you cantdo that in a presentation.
I doubt anyone saw that becauseI didnt even know I did it.
It jarred me. And when I finallycaught up, then you smiled.
You cant smileat me like that.
I never should have kissed you.
I assumed we wereforgetting about that.
I forgot it.
Well, I havent.
Oh.
What an old tune.
The boss in lovewith his protégé.
Is this all me?Because thatll help.
I think about it.
Well, we cant. I havesomeone, you have someone.
And believe me, Ive consideredit a lot further than that.
I didnt knowyou felt this way.
I dont want to,thats the point.
Now I realize I nevershould have brought it up.
Do you want meto work someplace else?
No.
Of course not.
Come on, you have to do it.

Can I walk you out?
Certainly, if youdont mind waiting.
I need your advice.
And, well,its of a personal nature
and thus above Clarassecurity clearance.
How can I help you?
Do you feel my attentionto business has been diluted?
How personalis this conversation?
Im being pulledin a million directions.
My wife, my child, my mother.
I cant solvethose problems, Pete.
I have those problems.
I live with my mother.
Has your mother exhaustedevery nursing agency?
No, but shes exhausted me.
Well...
the options aremy home and a home,
neither of whichwill make me feel better.
I am sorry to hear that.
- Do you want to get supper?- I cant. I have plans.
Thank you, Joan.
- For what?- I dont know.
Welcome.
Oh, Im a little damp.
Did it finally rain?
No, but I walked.This was cold when I left.
You walked from the West Side?
What an incredible space.
Did you do this yourself?
Oh, I had a little help.
Arlene, you read about thesh**t in the park, didnt you?
Im not gonna leta few lunatics
ruin a gorgeous nightlike this.
Should I go get my script?
Megan, darling,
youre a good actress
on your way to becoming, well,
at least a successful one.
Theres nothing I cantell you about that script.
I came over here becauseIm worried about you.
Am I gonna get fired?
I remember my first job.
Believe it or not, in radio.
"Against the Storm."
Very classy, a lot ofbig words, high morals.
And my agent,who I later learned
was anglingto sign Roger DeKoven,
told me my voice was childish.
And every day I wouldvacillate between
"Arlene, youre wonderful"and "Arlene, youre caca."
Which was it?
Honestly?
I was wonderful.
You should go inside.
Youll get eatenalive out here.
You know mosquitos ignore me.
In those shorts?
Did you find a bottle?
Maybe.
Cheers.
I loved camp.
I never went.
Yes, you did.
Remember when we went to LakeChamplain with my parents?
I remember.
And you got in a horriblefight with my father
about who wouldcarry the luggage.
And then we went in thewoods and made Sally.
I dont understand her.
Henry saysshes a lot like you.
How would he know?
He says she reminds him of you.
I think shes a lot like you.
Bobby reminds me of my father.
So bossy.
All the teenagersof the world are in revolt.
What were we like?
You and me?
When I saw you earlier today
I thought for a second,"Who is that man?"
And I forgot how madI was at you.
Ugh, I dont know whatshappened, but Im all bit up.
Close the door.Youll let the bugs in.
What are you doing?
Waiting for youto tell me to stop.
What did you thinkwhen you saw me?
That you are as beautifulas the day I met you.
So finally I said to Mel,
"Im either his mother or his girlfriend.I cant be both."
Thats bad writing.
Youre so lucky hes at work.
Please, dear, thats acomplex relationship.
But he understands what you do
and he wants you to be great.
And hes always proud of you.Ive seen it.
Dons very proud of you.
You can tellby how protective he is.


Its been so different.
You know, we worked togetherand I left to pursue this.
And he was so encouraging.
And then youstarted succeeding.
Hes old-fashioned.
Hell get used to it.
I think he did.
And I think he got usedto me not being around
and having a bunch of problemsthat he couldnt solve.
And I dont know
if its him or me, but...
I feel so lonely.
Arlene.
What?
I want to make you feel better.
This isnt the way.
Forget it.
I cant believe you.
Im trusting you and youre takingadvantage of every private moment.
Well, what was Isupposed to think?
You invited me over.
Your husbands not here.
Two bottles of wineto go over a scene
a child could understand.
"Im so lonely."
I work with you and yourhusband is my boss.
And now what am Isupposed to do?
Am I gonna be punishedfor not doing something
that you wont stoptrying to do?
Megan, its okay to say no.
But you dont haveto embarrass me.
Im sorry.
I didnt mean to.
No, stop it.
Youre a tease.
Fine.
No, Im finewith being a tease.
Well, honey,
just learn the lines.
Two characters is tough,but you know what Olivier says,
let the wig do the work.
Im gonna gobefore I--
well, its too latefor that, isnt it?
Thank you for that.
No hard feelings.
Status quo ante bellum.
Everything as it was.
I missed you.
Do you feel guilty?
No.
This happened a long time ago.
Ugh, menthols.
I dont miss that.
Is this what it would have beenlike if wed stayed together?
I dont think aboutthat anymore.
Im happy in my life.
Lets just enjoy this.
But you used to?
What are you thinkingright now?
Im thinking abouthow different you are,
before and after.
I love the way you look at mewhen youre like this.
But then I watch it decay.
I can only holdyour attention so long.
Why is sex
the definition of beingclose to someone?
I dont know,
but it is for me.
It is for most people.
Just because you climb a mountaindoesnt mean you love it.
Climbing a mountain?
Is that whatmaking love is to you?
If wed lied here togetherwith you in my arms,
I would have feltjust as close.
Not the rest of it.I dont know.
I dont know.
It doesnt meanthat much to me.
Is it the same with Megan?
Why do you wantto talk about that?
That poor girl.
She doesnt knowthat loving you
is the worst way to get to you.
Are you sure you dontwant to just hold me?
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, thank God.What are you doing in here?
I was just fixing the window.
What the hell happened here?
Ill replace it tomorrowwhen I get back from work.
Because youre leaving me here
after someone threw a rockthrough our window?
Thats not what happened.
Well, I came in here and theresglass all over the floor
and youre holding a rock.
Im tired of beinginterrogated in my own home.
Do you think they saw youtalking to the police?
If youre gonna letyour imagination run wild,
come to the paperwith me tonight.
Abe, I have to goto work tomorrow.
And this is our bedroom.
Someone was in our yard.
Im really scared here.
And youre going to protect me?You only have one hand.
Youre right.Youre right.
Well start looking.Put it on the market.
Youd really do that for me?
Maybe were not cut outto be pioneers.
Sleep in the parlor if youre worried.I wont wake you.
Hello?
You took a four-year-oldto see "Planet of the Apes"?
Hes been havingnightmares all night.
Hold on, hold on.
He wanted to see that.
He doesnt decide that.
Well, Don took his kid.
Don Draper, Father of the Year.
Margaret, honey, he loved it.
Put him on, Ill do Dr. Zaius again.He laughs like an idiot.
The ForbiddenZone was once a paradise.
Youre not funny, Daddy.
Well probably have to get rid ofthe dog; hes that afraid of fur.
Listen, I saw "The Golem"when I was his age.
You dont even knowwhat scary is.
I was fine.Its not my fault.
Yeah, youre right.Its my fault.
For letting you talk meinto having a four-year-old
watch anotherfour-year-old.
Listen to me, young lady,you calm down this minute.
No, Daddy, you listen to me.
You can keep up your fantasyof acting like a father,
but your grandfatherdays are done.
Im sorry youre upset.Im coming over.
- Ill calm him down.- No.
And call Mother next timeyou want to see him
cause she has to be there.
- Morning.- Good morning.
Good to see you.
Its such a projectgoing to the beach.
Can I go get Kevin?
Let him sleep a little more.
Id love to get oneof those summer rentals.
Doesnt Pete Campbellhave a beach house?
I wouldnt ask himfor anything.
- Dont you like him?- Its not that.
Actually,hes the only person there
whos never brokena promise to me.
Hes a very generous person.
And frankly, I thinkhes having a rough time.
So he told youabout his mother?
No, I wish he would have.Whats wrong?
He needs a nurse.
Hes not gonna ask you.Hes too ashamed.
She back from the track already?
Ugh, she must haveforgotten her keys.
Oh, hello, Roger.
- Who are you?- Its me, Bob Benson.
From the office.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I was out shopping
and I realized I hadmisplaced some paperwork.
And I, uh--
what are you two doing?
Were leaving for the beach.
- You know what? I should go get the car.- Good idea.
No, Mr. Sterlingis just leaving.
Roger, Im surethis can wait till Monday.
Sure, absolutely.Sorry about that, Bob.
I guess were all a little bitout of context right now.
I take no offense.
Didnt know you were friends.
Some people never stop working.
Im going to freshen upand well get out of here.
Hey, get off our lawn!
Whats going on?
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Jesus!
Why didnt you say something?
- What do I do?- Dont pull it out.
- If I dont make it--- Stop it.
Youre going to make it.Hes going to make it.
Look, I dont want you to thinkthis is about what you did.
It was an accident.I feel horrible.
No, youre scared.
Youre a scared personwho hides behind complacence--
cy.
Save your strength. Yourenot making any sense.
I dont know whyI thought youd be braver.
Youre... in advertising.
Dont do this right now.I said I was sorry.
Your activities are offensiveto my every waking moment.
Im sorry...
but youll always be the enemy.
Are you breaking up with me?
Got to hand it to you.
You gave me a great endingto my article.
Oh, youre back.
Did you have fun?
I missed you.
Well, I miss you all the time.
I dont know when I startedpretending like everything was sunny.
I dont know where youve gone,
but Im here.
I keep trying to make thingsthe way they used to be,
but I dont know how.
And maybe thats stupid
or young to thinklike that, but...
something has to change.
Megan...
Youre right.
I havent been here.
Roger, please.
Come on, just take it.
Theyre Lincoln Logs.
I thought maybe hed buildhis mother a house.
You cant drop inon me like that.
But I want to.
Oh, Roger, Im so sorry,
but you cant do this.
Why not?
Because its too confusing.
For Kevin.You know.
But Im his father.
No, his father is Greg.
But Im here.
For now.
But every day Gregis some hero out there.
And Id rather him thinkthat is the man in his life.
Whos gonna watch TV with him?Bob Bunson?
I just want to be around.
I know you want to.
But I cant count on that.
Thank you for the gift.
Something delicatehas come to my attention.
Have a seat.
I...
Ive really debated whetherto bring this up with you
because I dont want to putyou in a strange position
and in the endits probably just gossip.
Its come to my attention
that you may be in needof a nurse for your mother.
Joan had no rightto tell you that.
His name is Manolo Colón.
Hes an army-trainedregistered nurse
and hes available nowonly because
hes brought my fatherback to full health.
Is he Spanish from Spain?Because otherwise Mother will refuse.
Hes very well-bred.
And dont blame Joan.
She was concerned about you
and had exhausted her resources
and is well awarethat your well-being
is also an interest of mine.
Good morning.
- Is he in?- Yes, just a minute.
Its okay.
Hi.Good morning.
Good morning.
I just wanted to--
I needed to talk to you.
Peggy, whats wrong?
I...
Abe got stabbed.
My goodness. Is he okay?What happened?
Hes going to be fine.
But its over.
Were done.
Im sorry to hear that.
You are?
Youll find someone else.
And whoever he is,hes lucky to have you.
Thank you.
You ready to get to work?
Excuse me?
Its Monday morning, Peggy.Brand-new week.
Morning.How was your weekend?
Howd it go with Fleischmanns?
They just called.Full speed ahead.
Good work.
