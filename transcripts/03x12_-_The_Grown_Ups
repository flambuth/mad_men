Mr. Campbell.Mr. Campbell.
I got your hot cocoa.
Wonderful.
I just got back from lunch,and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.
- Its instant.- Its from the diner.
I dont know how you can tell.
You can tell becausethey use water instead of milk.
Its warmer outside. Its ridiculous.
The building will take care of it.They always do.
Sorry about that.This really is hitting the spot.
Come in.
Have a seat.
I believe I havewhat is rather disappointing news.
Its been decided that Mr. Cosgrove
will be made senior vice presidentin charge of account services,
and you will be madehead of account management.
Really?
This is not to ignorethat youve distinguished yourself
and been of great service to the company.
What is it based on?Our billings are neck and neck.
In fact, I think Ive done a lot withwhat I was given in this arbitrary scheme.
Its become apparent
that you are excellent at making the clientsfeel their needs are being met,
but Mr. Cosgrove has the rare giftof making them feel
as if they havent any needs.
- I see.- I improved your title.
And you tell your clientstherell be no need to be deprecating.
- Bert and Roger know about this?- This is under my authority.
And I have to commend youon taking it as well as you have.
- I hope this was a difficult decision.- It was.
There you go.
- Where are you going?- I dont feel well.
Why did you pick that place?
I dont know why a lunch counteris any better than eating at your desk.
Well, you couldve joined me for a drink.
I can drink at my desk if I want to,and Im not out $1.25.
Im sorry Im not as stimulatinga lunch companion as Doug.
- Its Duck, and I work most lunches.- Well, I dont like his aftershave.
I can smell it on you, and I can smell itin the bathroom in the morning.
Whats wrong with him?
Nothing. I dont even knowwhy Im weighing in on men right now.
I think its goodthat youre being picky, finally.
Well, theres nothing aroundbut married ones.
I mean, we cant allthrow caution to the wind.
But Ducks not married.
Then why are you with him?
- Well, this is me. You working late tonight?- I dont know yet.
- Okay.- Bye.
Wow. Van Cleef.How very Jane Siegel-Sterling.
- Theyre blue and theyre new.- Shes trying.
You always take her side.
I do not.
She started giving me advice.
"Dont go to bed angry.Let them do what they want.
"Dress sexy. "
And all I kept thinking about was Daddy.Its disgusting.
Doesnt she know that?That she ruined my life?
Your father had a part in it.
You dont think I know that?
- Brooks is different than your father.- I dont want to get married.
Everythings pointing to the factthat I shouldnt, and everybody knows.
Brooks knows. His mother knows.Do you know what she said to me?
She said in India, if the weddingdoesnt take place at the appointed hour,
they burn the bride.
Just because she went to Indiadoesnt mean shes not an idiot.
And Jane. If shes coming,
Im not going.
Shes coming, because your fathers comingand he paid for everything.
Youre having the wedding.The bride will not be b*rned.
Turn those earringsinto a tea service or something.
- Arent you listening to me?- I am,
and youre babbling like a little fool.Go to your room.
- What?- You heard me.
You want to act like a child,Ill treat you like one.
Would somebody get that?
- Hello?- Daddy?
Are you alone?
- Yes, whats wrong?- Nothings right.
My bridesmaids are supposed to give mesomething blue and something new.
- Or Mommy. She should know that.- Who?
I dont like her, Daddy, and Ive told youI dont want her to be there.
- Honey, put your mother on the phone.- He wants to talk to you.
You have to keep Jane under control.
Well, first of all, tell the bridethat everything is copacetic.
We both agree that shes nutsand she should shut up.
Your father said that hes sorryand that Jane will stay out of your way
- and that were both tired of the drama.- He said all that?
Im not playing chicken anymore.If she wants to cancel the wedding,
Ill take the deposit out of her inheritance.
- He said the weddings off.- Fine.
You mean that?Youre not worried about India?
- Why are you doing this?- Do you want to cancel it or not?
No.
Then go eat something.Im not taking that dress in again.
Why did Jane get hersuch an expensive gift?
I didnt even know they saw each other.
- Of course you didnt.- I forbid it.
- Cant wait to get her out of here.- Everything okay?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Jane! Get in here, now.
- I didnt know you were home.- I overdid it at lunch,
as did you, I heard.
Im sorry, sweetheart.I just wanted to make amends.
I got her a beautiful present.
Why the hell are you even talking to her?Youre screwing things up!
Im tired of the awkwardness,and Im trying to be nice.
And I dont knowwhat kind of world you live in,
- but I am the good person here.- Youre not good,
because you didnt listen to meand you really upset her.
Everything you do is for her.
Im your wife.
And guess what?I live here and I get to do what I want to do,
so stop trying to tell methat you know better.
- Youd better not have locked that door.- Go away!
Or what? Youll commit su1c1de?
- Peter, what are you doing home?- I got fired.
What happened?
Lane told me Kenny is senior somethingof something accounts and Im not.
Im account something.
I couldnt even hear him.All I saw was his frog-like mouth flapping.
- So, did he ask you to leave?- No.
I have to ask this,but did you lose your temper?
No, I didnt.
Thats good. Thats very good.
Do you remember if he said anythingabout how much they want you to stay?
- No.- Thats good, too. So it didnt come up.
Trudy, stop it with the Ellery Queen.
- Im going to call Duck.- No, youre not.
They would have fired youif they wanted to fire you.
You need to wait and see how it goes.
He basically said I care too muchabout my clients and they notice it.
How could that be bad?
Peter, you hold all the cards.
Its going to be fine.
I thought youd left.
- Im here.- I see.
- Well, thank you.- Ive done it before.
Go back to bed.
- Do you want anything?- No. Ill be in, in a bit.
- Its got to be 100 degrees in here.- You ask the building for heat, you get heat.
Mr. Herman on line one.
- Hello? Can you give me a minute?- No.
Im right around the cornerat the Elys?e, room 531.
- Im in the middle of something.- Pee wee, sweetheart, its been three weeks.
You can get room service. I think they havea Monte Cristo sandwich. You love that.
Im having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.
Theyre a couple of homos.Tell them you have plans.
- Its kind of short notice.- Come on, Creative, be creative.
I have to go to the printer.
- I know a nooner when I hear one.- Youre disgusting.
No, Bob did.
Bob?
I was hoping to catch youon your way to lunch.
Too late.
- I must say Im surprised.- Frankly, I was a little suspicious...
I found out yesterday that head of accountsis going to Kenny and his haircut.
- I heard.- This is the first time hes invited her here...
- Can you turn that off?- Not really.
Did you ask him why he invited her?
He said something about not wanting herto actually have to get involved.
- Were you consulted?- After the fact.
- What does it mean?- Its not good.
I know its not good.Theres no future for me here.
- How did you do it? You made your job up.- I didnt.
I looked at other agenciesand saw that they had TV departments
and wondered why we didnt.
Well, theres no such thingin the accounts field.
- Theres marketing.- Thats a research job.
- Is this official?- Yes.
Im afraid we cant hire Mr. Charcot.
Well, at least you had the gutsto send me a memo.
- Hes far too expensive.- Salvatore Romano is gone.
There is no one in chargeof the art department.
I havent heard a complaintfrom any of the clients.
- Jesus! Its hotter in here than in my office.- Thats because youre overexcited.
Do you want me to walk you througha delivery schedule?
This is Walter Cronkite in our newsroom,
and there has been an attempt,as perhaps you know now,
on the life of President Kennedy.
He was wounded in an automobile drivingfrom Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas
along with Governor Connally of Texas.
Theyve been takento Parkland Hospital there,
where their condition is as yet...
My God, how muchhave you been smoking in here?
Sorry about that.
- Im glad you ran over.- Me too.
I dont understand. I cant runmy department without an art director.
- You want to call Saint John?- Bert Cooper still has a say around here.
Hello. What?
If they wanted to fire you,they wouldve fired you.
Im gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.
Do you have any ideawhat Ive done for this company?
- What are you doing?- Christ!
- Somebody sh*t the president.- Turn on the TV.
What?
...top of the presidents car was down.
They drew their p*stol,but the damage was done.
- Oh, my God. Unbelievable.- The president was slumped over
in the backseat of the car, face down,
then Governor Connally,after slumping to the left for a moment,
lay on the floor of the rear seats.
- Oh, my God.- Dear God.
Is he dead?
What the hell is going on?
Every person listening at this momenthas flashed back to that day in April, 1945,
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt...
Excuse me, Chet, here is a flashfrom the Associated Press, dateline Dallas.
Two priestswho were with President Kennedy
say he is dead of b*llet wounds.
There is no further confirmation,but this is what we have on a flash basis...
- Is he okay?- They just said he died.
Two priests in Dallaswho were with President Kennedy
say he is dead of b*llet wounds.
- Oh, lord.- There is no further confirmation.
This is the only word we have indicatingthe president may, in fact, have lost his life.
It has just movedon the Associated Press wires from Dallas.
The two priests were called to the hospitalto administer the last rites...
- Oh, my goodness.... of the Roman Catholic Church,
- and it is from them we get the word...- I know.
...that the president has died,
that the b*llet wounds inflicted on himas he rode in a motorcade
through downtown Dallas have been fatal.
We would remind you there is no officialconfirmation of this from any source as yet.
Bill, just moments beforeyou brought the flash,
I had word from the hospital
that the vice president, Lyndon Johnson,and his wife had just left the hospital,
been rushed away into a...
Did you give me a hickey?
- I dont think so.- I told you I dont like that.
I get questions from my mother.
Listen, there was a news storythat was on right before you came in.
- Its been distracting me.- You didnt seem distracted.
- I just want to see whats going on.- Whats going on?
Because it was only on October the 24ththat our ambassador to the United Nations,
Adlai Stevenson, was as*ault in Dallasleaving a dinner meeting there.
From Dallas, Texas,the flash, apparently official,
President Kennedy died at 1:00 p. m.Central Standard Time,
2:00 Eastern Standard Time...
- Jesus.- Oh, my God.
...some 38 minutes ago.- What happened?
Vice President Lyndon Johnsonhas left the hospital in Dallas.
- Ive gotta call my kids.- We do not know
to where he has proceeded.
Presumably, he will be takingthe oath of office shortly
and becomethe 36th President of the United...
President Johnson is under heavy guardand was whisked away from the hospital...
Its ruined.
- President Kennedy, we are now informed...- Its all ruined.
Its gonna be ruined.
...five-year-old boy and myself
were by ourselves on the grass thereon Palmer Street,
- and I asked Joe to wave to him...- Betts?
...and Joe waved and I waved,and the man...
Thats all right, sir. Go ahead and tell it.
As he was waving back, he was...The sh*t rang out, and he slumped down...
- Wheres your mother?- Shes not feeling well.
He was slumping down and the secondsh*t went off and just knocked him down.
- I cant stop crying.- No, sir, I did not see the man who did it.
All I did was look in the mans facewhen he was sh*t there...
Why are the kids watching this?
What am I supposed to do, Don?Am I supposed to keep it from them?
...that it hit him and he wentall the way down in the car.
Take a pill and lie down.I can handle the kids.
...fell on him in hopesthat there wasnt a maniac around.
Im sorry, I cant help you more,but I wont forget it.
- Turn this off. Ill make us some dinner.- A Polaroid picture
taken by another witness,Mary Moorman of Dallas,
showing the presidentslumped over in the car.
Just as Mary started to take the picture,the president came right even with us,
- two shots... We looked at him...- You two, look at me.
Two shots rang outand he grabbed his chest.
Everythings gonna be okay.
...on his face and fell across,towards Jackie...
- We have a new president...- And she...
...and were all gonna be sad for a little bit.... fell over on him
and said, "My God, hes sh*t!"
And then on Mondaytheres gonna be a funeral.
Are we going to the funeral?
...more shots rang out, but by that timethe motorcade had sped away.
What prompted you to take the pictureat that particular instance?
Well, thats the only chance I had.
For the nation and the world,
Mrs. Rockefeller and Ijoin with all New Yorkers
and every American in extending heartfelt...
...chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba,a pro-Castro organization,
where he had been arrestedon disturbance of the peace charges.
He denied he was a communist,said he was a Marxist,
and claimed there was quite a differencebetween the two.
Police in Dallas have just announced...
- You should get ready. Its almost 2:00.- Really, Don?
...has g*n traces on both hands,indicating hed recently used a r*fle,
the type of w*aponthat k*ll Mr. Kennedy yesterday.
As we told you a short time ago,Oswald has refused...
Hes 24 years old.
In Washington,the body of the late president
lies in the East Room of the White House...
- Come on, Betts.... as official Washington and members of...
Are you sure they havent canceled it?It said in The Times they were doing that.
Im not gonna call Roger to find out.
If we go in and its off,well grab dinner or something.
...third-floor living quartersof the White House...
- I cant sit in front of the TV all day.- Fine.
...ailing Mr. Kennedy stricken by a stroketwo years ago...
Just stay here until Carla comes.
...greatly, increasingly failing healthfor the last...
After the terrible news had reached us,
- 60,000 Berliners...- Can you see bags?
- I dont understand this. Here we are.... gathered with torches in their hands.
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.
Nobody voted for him. It felt for a secondlike everything was about to change.
You should get your coat and your scarf.I know its far, but I really feel like walking.
Why are we going?
Because its your bosssdaughters wedding.
Its business, Pete, and theres a system.You always say that.
Its one thing to go to this weddingand act like I dont hate them.
Its another thing to go and actlike the president hasnt been m*rder.
Maybe theyll cancel it,but we have to show.
...in the White House today and tomorrow.
Though it is knownthat they have lost their best...
- Have you been drinking?- The whole countrys drinking,
and not to celebratesome spoiled brats wedding.
We are mourning together with his widow...
- Theyll never cancel. You know why?... with his children,
- his parents, brothers and sisters.- Because theyre happy.
You shouldve heard some of the thingspeople said yesterday.
Like what? What did they say?
"The man made a lot of enemies,"things like that.
Thats awful. I dont carewhat your politics are, this is America.
You dont just sh**t the president.
Edwin Walker, who...
Chet Huntley was talking about Jackieand those kids
and how shed just lost that baby,
and Harry Cranewas looking at his paperwork,
calculating how many commercialswerent going to be aired.
...this prepared statementbe handed to newsmen...
Im not going.
You can go and say Im sick,if you think its that important.
"... demonstrates the internal threatthat can never be underestimated. "
No, youre right.
"Our sympathy for the Kennedy familyis no less than it is
"for the millions of peoplewho have sustained equal losses
"in the fight for freedom. "Then General Walkers statement went on...
I got a call from Leona, this girlI used to work with at the phone company.
My friend Francine called me.Don couldnt get through.
Well, the systemwas completely overloaded.
Its annoying that people thinkthe operators were watching TV.
They were as frustrated as anyone.
The maitre d has reorganized the seating.
If you are at an even-numbered table,take these first six.
If you are at an odd-numbered table,the left side of the room.
Maestro, do you mind? Thank you.
Look, everybody, grab your plateand come on up to the front here.
Sit wherever you feel like,
and please feel free to havethe prime rib and the fillet of sole.
Help yourself.I mean that. There are no waiters.


Three months after Roosevelt died,we b*mb Hiroshima.
Thats how we got over it.
I say we hang Lee Oswald, and then wetake care of Texas. Hell, the whole South.
What did everyone thinkof the sweetbreads?
You were right, Mommy. Okay?
- Problem solved.- Hardly.
- They just told me the cakes not coming.- Shit.
Of course.
I have to say, on some level,Harry has a point.
I think he wanted attention.He obviously didnt fit in.
Congratulations.
You are so beautiful,like Natalie Wood or something.
Daddy, I really wishyou couldve gotten to see the ceremony.
Its okay. We understand.Were honored youre here.
- I heard the church was packed.- Those werent our guests.
Have a seat.
Just sit anywhere.
Im so happy for you.
I would like some legal representation,
but these police officershave not allowed me to have any.
I dont know what this is all about.
- Did you k*ll the president?- No, sir, I didnt.
- People keep asking me that. Sir?- Did you sh**t the president?
How would you knowthats what a monster looks like?
Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.
Did you see The Times? He lived in Russia.
- I thought he just visited.- Would you visit?
- Im just a patsy.- Did you sh**t the president?
- There you are. What are you doing here?- Theyre about to interview Oswald.
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.
- Lets keep it quiet and well all get it!- Hold it down.
Has the gentleman been identified?
Yes, sir, hes been identifiedfor k*ll the officer.
I need you out there.Im about to give my toast.
Ive heard your toast a million times.The president is dead.
And Ill tell you something else,our table has no one at it.
I consolidated the tables.
- Would you keep an eye on her?- Absolutely.
We better get back in there.
- We want to say this...- Jane.
...that this investigationhas been carried on jointly by...
This toast is going to be much shorterthan it was supposed to be.
Obviously, were all in a different mood.
Can someone pleaseget my wife out of the kitchen?
I have something very nice to say about her.But while were alone...
I want to say something niceabout my ex-wife.
Mona, youre a lioness.
And thank you for resistingthe urge to eat your cub.
This couldve been an awful day,
but here we are, not watching TV,but together watching the two of you.
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.
The adults,we all wanted to be strong for you,
but your spirit, your love,your hope is giving us strength.
And I promise you now,if you can make it through a day like today,
marriage is a cakewalk.
To many years of happiness.
- Cheers.- Cheers.
We invite the father of the brideand the bride to share the dance floor.
Sorry about that.
Now, if there are any otherfathers and daughters...
You know what?Everyone, please join them.
- Do you want to dance?- I dont know.
- Want me to teach him how to dance?- Hes a great dancer.
Shes happy.
Thats because she doesnt knowhis net worth just dropped by half.
Stop it, Daddy.
Hey.
Everythings gonna be fine.
How do you know that?
Youll see.
Why do you keep looking at that woman?
What are you talking about?
- Are you ready?- Did Jennifer fall in?
- Shell be right out.- See you Tuesday.
He was so handsome,and now Ill never get to vote for him.
Hey.
You want me to cut you out of that dress?
Im making a phone call.
- Hello?- So whats new?
- Its incredible, isnt it?- Yes.
Margaret got married today.
Thats right, I forgot. Poor thing.
Joanie, I wish you couldve seen it.Oh, my God, what a disaster.
Im sorry.
She pulled through.They pulled through. I pulled through.
I cant believe how quiet it is out there.
Not everywhere. Greg just called.Hes working the night shift at the ER.
People are still getting sick.
Car accidents are happening.Babies are being born.
Well, Im glad hes not home.I had to talk to you.
Nobody else is sayingthe right thing about this.
My God, youre really upset.
Whats that about?
Because theres nothing funny about this.
Well, hang in there, red.
You too.
- Bye-bye.- Goodbye.
Put him on a standbyof indeterminate length, will you?
Let me have it. I want it.
Being led out by Captain Fritz.
There is the prisoner. There is Lee Oswald.
Hes been sh*t.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.- What happened?
Lee Oswald has been sh*t.
They sh*t him. The police were walking himthrough the building
- and some man ran up and sh*t him.- What?
Detectives have their g*n drawn.
- What is going on?- Oswald has been sh*t.
There is no question about it.Oswald has been sh*t.
- Please, leave me alone.- Betts?
...here in the basementof Dallas police headquarters.
What happened?
- Do you know where he is at present?- No, sir, I dont.
- Can you give us some indication...- Nothing. Go upstairs.
The family, incidentally,asked that there be no flowers,
but there have, nevertheless, been flowers.
People either didnt hearor chose to ignore it,
and one room or two roomsin the White House have had to be set aside
to hold them. The casket, incidentally,
will remain closed at all timesduring all ceremonies...
Im going out.
- Where?- For a drive.
Let me drive. Ill get the kids.Well all go somewhere. Thats a good idea.
No. I need to clear my head.
...airports, four of them around town...
- Im so glad you could see me.- Where does your husband think you are?
I dont care. Hes been lying to me for years.I couldnt be in that house.
Then I saw you yesterday.I didnt know you were going to be there.
I hoped you would be there.
Derby day, it seems like 100 years ago.
And then this morning,seeing that man sh*t to death...
What is going on?
It will be okay. Weve lost a lot of presidentsand were still standing.
I wish I could believe you.I cant believe anything right now.
Have you thought thatthere are other ways to live?
Listen. Im not in lovewith the tragedy of this thing.
Its not Romeo and Juliet.I want it to happen.
I have three children.
Ill know more when the primariesstart to shake out in spring,
- but I can leave the campaign right now.- I dont want you to do that.
You dont have to answer me now,
but I want to marry you.
- I dont know what to say.- You dont have to say anything.
I told you.
But if you search your heart,youll know that I can make you happy.
I should go.
I wish I could take youto the movies right now,
that some theater was playingyour favorite movie.
Singin in the Rain.
Well, just think about that.
This is made possible by special equipment,and it will move at one-fourth speed.
So we would like to show youthe slow motion of the sh**ting
of Lee Harvey Oswald now.
They just stood there.
No security.The most wanted man in America.
Why even have a trial?Just throw him over to the mob.
Now you can see the two detectives,one in a light suit, one in a dark,
bringing Oswald out.
The camera changes its lensfor a close-up of Oswald.
The sh*t has been fired. You cannot hear itin this version of the tape.
Oswald falls.The man with the hat moves in on him.
Hes grabbed by the man in light.
- Youre not going into work tomorrow?- No, of course not.
- Its a national day of mourning.- Youre going to go in Tuesday.
Theres another happy thought.
Those people dont care about you.And honestly, whats the difference?
What are you saying?
You did everything they asked you to do,but you dont owe them anything.
...minutes past 2:00 Eastern Standard Time,we were advised
that Lee Harvey Oswald was dead.Now Ruby is under arrest...
You should start gathering your clients.Theyll follow you wherever you go.
...is the operator of two nightclubsin Dallas...
The only other president buried thereis William Howard Taft,
though, of course, there are manyother heroes of perhaps lesser renown.
That is the Lee... Robert E. Lee Mansion.
Its name, Arlington, has been givento the cemetery and, in fact, to the county.
- Francine has the kids.- The presidents brother, Robert Kennedy,
and the Secretary of Defense,Robert McNamara...
- I dont know where to begin.- What?
I want to scream at youfor ruining all of this.
But then you try to fix itand theres no point.
Theres no point, Don.
Youre very upset. I understand.
I know its painful, but its going to pass.
- I dont love you.- Betts, dont.
- Youre distraught.- Thats true,
but I dont love you anymore.
- I know that.- Stop it.
- I kissed you yesterday.- Kennedys remains...
I didnt feel a thing.
...the public allowed to pass throughand pay its respects.
There will be a little roped...
Youll feel better tomorrow. Youll see.
You cant even hear me right now.
Youre right.
...on Monday it will be taken
to the St. Matthews Cathedral, which is onRhode Island Avenue in Washington,
for the funeral.
This, I think, is the largestCatholic cathedral in town.
It is, as you see, draped in black.
Its been open all day.Great numbers of people have stopped...
- Morning.- Morning, Daddy.
Good morning.
- Where are you going?- I have to go to work. Im sorry.
- Its cold outside.- Im fine.
Peggy.
What are you doing here?
I dont know. Aqua Net.
It doesnt sh**t till after Thanksgiving.
Well be okay.
What do you have?
- What are you doing here?- The bars are closed.
My roommate invited over half the buildingso they could watch TV
and write condolence letters to Jackie.
Then I went to my sistersand my mother was crying
and praying so hard.
There wasnt roomfor anyone else to feel anything.
The funerals already started.
I was going to watch in Coopers office.Is that okay?
Yes.
Are you coming?
