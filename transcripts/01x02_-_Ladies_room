Should get him to put another egg in it.
Roger.
Darling, one egg is good. Two eggs are better.
Tell the, uh, lieutenant, please,
that things are getting a little dry around Hill   .
Am I wrong?
All clear in No Mans Land.
Betty?
Roger, youve expressed your desire for another drink.
No need to take the orders.
Right away, sir.
Wine list,
and Ill have another one of thesewhile Im waiting for the list.
Another egg.
Well, I am having fried chicken.
As long as the egg comes first.
My nanny, Belva, made fried chicken.
I used to take it to school wrapped in wax paper.
His sweet Belvedere.
He really loved that woman.
Had another nanny originally. German girl.
Round face, enormous bosom.
My parents got rid of her after the Lindbergh baby.
We thought about getting a nanny.
We have a girl that comes in
whos sort of a housekeeper and sometimes babysitter.
Id let her take the children to play group,sometimes the park.
Belva raised me.
I turned out just fine.
Didnt have to go to a psychiatrist like some peoples kids.
Oh, whats the big deal?
Margaret is practically the last girl in our building to go.
   years old, wouldnt get out of bed.
I tell you, I cannot wait until that girlis another mans problem.
What about you, Don?
Did you have a nanny?
I cant tell you about my childhood.
It would ruin the first half of my novel.
Don doesnt like to talk about himself.
I know better than to ask.
An ad man who doesnt like to talk about himself?
I think I may cry.
Its not that interesting a story.
Just think of me as Moses.
I was a baby in a basket.
To Moses and Don Draper: A couple of princes.
If the gentlemen will be patient.
Ill join you.
I think I may know more about your wifethan I do about my own.
Maybe your wife is just a better drinker.
Entirely possible.
Mona, could you help me here?
I seem to have grown a set of thumbs.
Do you ever have that when your hands go numb?
You want me to touch you up?
Yeah, I think youll have to.
Look at those lips.
Ill bet its not hard for youto hold on to a man like that.
Dont smile. Itll make it harder.
Its hard to hold on to anythingright now with the... children
and running the house and...
I dont know if I told you,
but my m-mother died two, three months ago.
Im sorry.
There are other ladies waiting to use the mirror.
Those purses get any smaller, were gonna starve.
I love seeing you like that.
Well, you were sitting on my good side.
No. I mean, the way other people see you.
When youre with strangers, you know exactly what you want.
Well, I like to think I always know what I want.
Slow down.
Ill have to put that in my diary:
Lobster Newburg and gimlets should get a divorce.
Theyre not getting along very well.
Once you rounded the corner on number two,
I took it for a case of nerves.
Hes your boss.
He likes you.
Toots Shor means he likes me.
When he gets us to the Four Seasons,
then well know he trusts me.
Hmm. He seemed very forthcoming.
Yeah. When hes stoned on martinis.
I dont know.
It all seemed like an invitation to you
to con... confide.
Well, maybe its just manners,
but I was raised to see it as a sin of pride
to go on like that about yourself.
Youre so reverent.
Did you have a nanny?
Ive never asked you that.
Why? What difference does it make?
I dont know. Weve never talked about it.
Did you?
No, of course not.
So your mother and father are responsible for all this?
Ill have to thank them someday.
Jesus, Bets.
Its like politics, religion, or sex.
Why talk about it?
I see your point.
Who is in there?
Peggy, next step is accessories.
$   a week, minus  .   for FICA.
Can you believe it?
Maybe its the fumesfrom the rubber cement on that envelope,
but theres nothing to be happy about here,
although you never forget your first.
For two weeks Ive been telling peopleI have a job in Manhattan.
Look at you. Youre indomitable.
Youd never know you were the very bottom of the food chain.
Bridget? Are you okay?
Thanks to the Precision Valve Corporation,
for the next    months,
Gillette is the only company on Earththat can spray deodorant out of a can.
Modern deodorant for a modern man.
He prefers jet travel to train travel,
vodka to Scotch,
and he likes to get his news from the radio, not the paper.
Harold Hill, give it a rest.
"Do not puncture or incinerate."
Sounds dangerous.
Hey, I got a dud.
How is it a guy as big as you, Ken,
has no basketball k*ll?
Im sure more research is needed.
We should try it out.
Who smells bad in here?
Oh, no. Come on.
- Come on, Kenny.- Knock it off!
Just pretend its prom night.
You can be the girl.
Stop!
Engage rockets.
All right, close your eyes.
Mr. Draper, I was buzzing you.
Mr. Cooper is waiting.
I always thought it was Sterling
who was responsible for the Navy attitude around this place.
Brassiere account.
Just figured out we cant sell them to men.
So much yarn, so little time.
So Roger mentioned this Nixon thing.
Yeah, he mentioned it.
I just assumed it went away.
It didnt.
Last I read, Nixon was running without an agency.
Make no mistake, we know better
what Dick Nixon needs better than Dick Nixon.
What does Dick Nixon think he needs?
What he already has: Ted Rogers,
the brains behind that Checkers broadcast.
See the problem?
He dodged a financial scandal
by standing with his wife and begging for his dog.
An admission wrapped in a distraction.
Id say they know what theyre doing.
Dogs are winners.
Well, they think theyre set without us.
Why chase a girl who doesnt want to get caught?
You have a problem with Nixon?
I dont vote.
Hear, hear.
But politics aside,
these last eight years have been good to us
because theyve been good to Proctor & Gamble
and The United Fruit Company, et cetera.
So whether Dick Nixon likes it or not...
We will give our people what they want, agreed?
I said cut it out!
Be my pleasure.
Goodie.
Assemble a team.
Start files on contenders:
Symington, Kennedy...
Who knows? Maybe Eleanor Rooseveltwill throw her feedbag into the ring.
Don, you still on for lunch?
No.
Dont tell me thats lunch.
Ive got a lot of work to catch up on.
I do that sometimes.
Saunter over to the pie cart.
Egg salad and the worst cup of coffee in the world.
   cents.
Ive been meaning to try it.
Its okay if you like ptomaine poisoning.
Well, toodle-oo.
Secretary  , copywriter  .
It wasnt that.
I bring my lunch at least until afterthe first of the month.
Get your things.
That sandwich is making me sad.
Its a postcard from Campbell on his honeymoon.
Niagara Falls.
"Greetings from the wettest place on earth."
I say we skip lunch altogether
and try on those narrow sweater setsI saw at Lord and Taylor.
Do you want me to sit outside the dressing room
and hold your purse?
What hes trying to say is can we buy you lunch?
Oh. I dont know.
We hadnt planned on eating.
Come on, three on two.
I know you all like being outnumbered.
Thats two on two. Im married.
You still have to eat lunch.
What do you say? Change of plans?
They do smell nice.
Whats that?
Postcard from Pete Campbell.
Hes on a honeymoon, right?
Niagara Falls.
He hasnt, uh, left the room, apparently.
Shall we?
So, Pegs, you part of our nations military industrial
boyfriend-girlfriend complex?
Excuse me?
He wants to know are you, uh, taken,are you kept, or merely browsing?
Shes browsing.
And like most of us,
shes disappointed with the selection of merchandise.
Perhaps I can interest you in a    long?
Thats not his suit size.
She blushes.
No, I dont.
Maybe I shouldnt tell you this, but, uh,you are the subject of much debate.
Money riding on the outcome.
Money for me?
Now theres even a third possibility:
Paying you.
We should be getting back.
Ill get the check.
My goodness. Thank you for lunch, boys.
Yes. Thank you.
Take the rest of the afternoon off.
We could... go to the zoo, see what the animals are up to.
I should get back to work.
Or shopping.
Guess I dont see any money changing hands, Kenny.
Youll see.
My persistence is my charm.
That was delicious.
You enjoy yourself with the h*tler Youth?
Oh. Well, it was kind of last-minute.
Easy. See that Draper takes a look at this.
Certainly.
You can look, too.
Three of the last PTA presidentsare from the kindergarten class.
I say you go in there and lay some groundwork.
I will not have Marilyn Kechner dictate the agenda.
The woman is obsessed with nutrition,
although you wouldnt know it to look at her.
Francine, youre terrible.
Ooh. I ran into Juanita Cabot at square dancing,
and I found out whos movinginto that little Dutch Colonial down the street.
Who?
Her name is Helen Bishop.
Is she an old lady?
Divorced.
Really?
 - year-old boy and a baby.
Thats awful.
I know.
All on her own?
I know.
Can you imagine worrying about moneyat this point in our lives?
Well, obviously, thats not the worst of it.
No.
No, it isnt.
It is too quiet in there.
Ernie?
Sally?
Were playing spaceman.
Sally Draper, come over here this minute.
If the clothes from that dry cleaning bagare on the floor of my closet,
youre going to be a very sorry young lady.
Make sure your brother hasnt climbed out of the play yard.
Juanita thinks it might be badfor real estate values in Chilmark.
One divorc√©e?
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
Whats that?
What?
That.
Thats a television.
Since when do you have a television?
I dont know. I think its been about ten days.
Its been so amazing, I sort of lost track.
I seem to remember a woman
wasting a good piece of a beautiful afternoon
reciting this diatribe against television
that should have endedwith her banging her shoe on the table.
Don, darling, if you want to ask the question, just ask it.
Whered you get the TV?
I got it.
Same place you got that wig?
Someone gave it to me.
And you took it?
Have you seen this thing called People Are Funny?
Jesus.
Oh, Jesus, Don.
Hey!
All better?
Yes.
How about a hot dog?
Sit at your places. Come on.
Daddy!
We went to the hospital.
We got lollipops.
Theyre fine, Don.
What about you?
A little sore.
A little embarrassed.
Sorry they couldnt get a hold of me.
We had to carry Freddie Rumson out of Ritazzis.
There was nothing you could have done.
Daddy, use a fork.
Hows the car?
Not bad.
Uh, thank God I was only going    tops.
I hate the way you drive, you know.
Im finished.
Can I go watch Shirley Temples Storybook?
Yes, both of you.
So what happened?
I dont know, really.
It... It all happened so fast.
What,    miles an hour?
Thats not that fast.
Its stupid.
Was it Sally playing with the radio again?
- Ive warned her.- No, she was fine.
She was just sitting there. No.
It was my hands. It happened again.
Jesus.
Betty, you have to get this taken care of.
That Dr. Patterson is not thorough.
I swear, when we walked down Park Avenue,
I could hear the quacking.
I know. Youve said that.
This doctor was nice.
He was older, actually.
Hes from Rochester.
He has two children. Theyre    years apart.
Okay, youve given me his credentials.
What did he say?
Well, he said I could go to New York and run the dye tests,
and I said that I already hadand that the results were negative,
and he even called Dr. Patterson.
So?
They said there was nothing physically wrong with me.
Then I t-told him what happened,
and he said that I should see a psychiatrist.
Doctors must love
that they now have an answerfor "I dont know whats wrong."
He said it could be a nervous condition.
Nervous about what, driving?
So well go down to the Grand Union parking lot.
Well practice your    and  .
He seemed very concerned, if you want to know.
But thats their solution.
Why not open the hood and poke around?
So?
So... I left.
What else am I supposed to do?
Well, go to a doctor...
another doctor, a good one.
Ill get a specialist from Bert Cooper.
His names on a wall over at St. Vincents.
Okay.
Leave the dishes for the girl.
 ,  ,  ,
  ,   ,   ...
  ,   ,    .
You know, I do worry about you, birdie.
I know.
When he brought it up, I was shocked.
Although, I realize that thats what Dr. Patterson
was trying to say in his own way, and...
it doesnt have... as much of a stigma today.
I just dont know what they can possibly tell you.
Do you think I need a psychiatrist?
I always thought people saw a psychiatristwhen they were unhappy.
But I look at you...
and this...
and them...
and that...
and I think, "Are you unhappy?"
Of course Im happy.
Well, thatll be $  . Youre welcome.
Whatever you think is best.
Good.
Act of God. Sorry.
Someone threw themselves in front of the train.
Ah, su1c1de.
Okay, boys, what do we have?
Gentlemen, the aerosol can is nothing less than space-age.
Its steel. It has exhaust.
Its even shaped like a rocket.
Certainly an engineering marvel.
"Right Guard:
It works in my suit or yours."
Well punch the yellow of the moon so it pops behind him.
Were looking for new worlds,
and with that search comes any number of gadgets.
Its not just some random association.
This thing is shiny. Its expl*sive.
Its from the future, a place so close to us now,
filled with wonder and ease.
Except some people think of the future and it upsets them.
They see a rocket, they start building a b*mb shelter.
What? How do you get there?
I dont think its ridiculous to assumewere looking for other planets
because this one will end.
I thought we had something here.
Who is this moron flying around space?
I mean, he pees in his pants.
Brass tacks, who buys this?
Some woman.
Your girl or your mother will pick this up
walking through the grocery store or the druggists.
We should be asking ourselves,
"What do women want?"
I dont know, but I wish I had it.
Maybe a chesty alien girl also wants to get into his suit.
Im not asking "what do women want"
in some bullshit research psychology way.
Im asking, what would make a woman
look at this mans deodorant and say "I want that"?
Well, Ive stopped trying to figure out what they think.
Maybe I should stop paying you.
Well, I always thought women like the way we smell.
That explains a lot.
I feel like were close here.
I mean, this one...
the cans right side up, but the guys upside-down.
No. Lets bring it down to Earth.
You think they want a cowboy?
Hes quiet and strong.
He always brings the cattle home safe.
You watch TV.
What if they want something else?
Inside, some...
mysterious wish that were ignoring.
Howd it go?
Ive still got my novel.
Im sorry.
Buy me lunch?
Samuel, that drape, man?
Its sadder than a map.
Well, its lightweight, and it tells me Im at work.
But you sure can talk, Mr. Kinsey.
   cents.
What are you doing? Keep the change.
You figured the place out yet?
What do you mean?
How it runs.
I know the copywriters tell the Art Department what to do,
and I know the account executivestell the copywriters what to do.
What?
No one tells the writers what to doexcept for the head of Creative,
your boss, Donald Draper.
Dont think that just becausehes good-looking, hes not a writer.
Dig.
This is the Media Department.
Theyre where   % of where the clients check goes.
They buy space... newspapers, billboards, television,
and my favorite aging whore, radio.
Thats the whole shakedown, actually.
All you really need to know.
They dont sell ideas or campaigns or jingles.
They sell media at a   % markup.
Creative is just window dressing
thats thrown in for free.
Really?
Accounting, they keep track of how much were spending
versus how much were taking in,
and since were buying futures,
if you ever, ever see, um, the man upstairs go in there,
grab the lifeboats, baby.
Were going down.
Account Management,
where prep schoolers skip arm-in-arm, Wizard of Oz style,
joined together by their lack of k*lland their love of mirrors.
Account executives are all good at something,
although its never advertising.
Submitted for your approval: One Peter Campbell,
a man who recently discovered
that the only place for his hand is in your pocket.
You watch it?


Have you seen it? The Twilight Zone?
I dont think so. I dont like science fiction.
Im gonna pretend you didnt say that.
Mitch in Media says CBS might pull the plug.
Ill k*ll myself.
And here we have the Creative Department,
the talent, home sweet home.
Like the Art Department downstairs,
they put us far enough away from the elevators
so we cant sneak out.
You know,
there are women copywriters.
- Good ones?- Sure.
I mean, y-you can always tell when a womans writing copy,
but sometimes she just might bethe right man for the job, you know?
You must be very creatively satisfied.
Lets not lose our heads.
Sterling-Coop is positively Cro-Magnon.
I have a friend... Im not even going to say what agency...
but all they do is smoke Mary Jane and play darts,
and honestly, I think theyre the best store on the street.
You like Ukrainian food?
Oxtail dumplings?
I still have a lot of work to do.
I think hes still in there.
Huh. Got it.
Thanks for lunch. Sorry about your copy.
Thanks for reminding me.
Can never get used to the fact that most of the time
it looks like youre doing nothing.
Fix you something?
 :  . Close enough.
Coop is gonna want a carve-in
with your handpicked team for Nixon on it,
and I warn you right now, it includes Pete Campbell.
I should go to Niagara Falls for two weeks.
Does wonders for your career.
Niagara Falls.
Boy redefines lack of imagination.
Ah. Thats where youve been.
Let me ask you something.
What do women want?
Who cares?
You mentioned the other night
that your daughter had been to a psychiatrist.
Im sure you must be mistaken about that.
You know what?
I am very comfortable with my mind:Thoughts clean and unclean,
loving and... the opposite of that.
But Im not a woman.
And I think it behooves any man
to toss all female troubles into the hands of a stranger.
We had one headshrinker in the army.
A gossip, busting with other peoples thoughts.
Hasnt changed much, just costs more.
And you cant sh**t at them.
We live in troubling times.
We do?
Who could not be happy with all this?
Jesus, you know what they want?
Everything.
Especially if the other girls have it.
Trust me, psychiatry is just this years candy-pink stove.
Its just more happiness.
People...
Are...
Funnyl
Beauty and the beast.
Hey, Daddy.
Hey, there. Cold lamb sound good?
Yeah.
Someone started on the train.
In the office.
Because of a good day or a bad day?
You know, when I told you you had everything...
I was wrong.
Oh, my God.
White gold.
Its got one of those tiny little facesthat you have to be young to see.
Don, its beautiful.
The guy at the store set the time, but he was English,
so it might be six hours off.
Did you look at Sallys face?
I think she has a bruise.
I didnt see it.
On her cheekbone under her eye.
I thought that was ketchup.
What if she had gotten a scar, something permanent?
I dont want to play what-if.
Im just saying if it happened to Bobbyit would have been okay
because a boy with a scar is nothing,but a girl, its so much worse.
Nothing happened.
I keep...
thinking...
Not that I c-could have k*ll the kids,
but... worse.
Sally could have survived...
and gone on living with this...
horrible scar on her face, and...
some long, lonely...
miserable life as...
Don.
Whats happening to me?
Do I need to see someone?
I dont know.
I guess so.
Whatever you want.
   a. m. Did you get fired?
Brought Betty into the city to see the doctor,
but, uh, honestly...
I think Im the one thats not feeling so great.
I called in sick.
Dont bring that here.
Im serious, Don. Dont talk to me about her.
It makes me feel cruel.
Youre right.
Sometimes.
I cant decide
if you have everything...
or nothing.
I live in the moment.
Nothing is everything.
Sounds more like you live in the Village.
Actually, I live in the hall.
I lost my key.
I had to, um... spend the night abroad.
Could you be a gentleman
and break in to the fire escape so I dont have to?
Draper in yet?
Hes not coming in today. Hes not feeling well.
Im leaving. Dont tell anyone I was here.
Bienvenue.
No, its Peggy.
Hello.
I dont think I can go out to lunch today.
Mr. Drapers not coming in.
That means you can go out to lunch.
Have you never worked in an office before?
Well, he could call.
Its my second week.
Another time?
I did enjoy the tour the other day.
It was eye-opening.
I didnt think your eyes could be any wider.
Thats clever.
I guess Ill go to the cart. You want something?
What?
The office is gonna empty out any second.
We can push the couch in front of the door.
Paul.
Do you belong to someone else?
Shit.
I dont even like to sit in Dons chair.
I think weve misunderstood each other.
But there is someone else, right?
Yes.
I hope you know that covering your typewriter
is office code for "Im done for the day."
Im not feeling so swell.
Neither am I. Look at these letters you typed after lunch.
Terre Haute, Indiana,has two Rs and an A and an E at the end.
I think either you missed home row by a hand,
or you were out drinking with the junior account boys again.
I wasnt drinking.
I dont like your tone.
Ill redo these right away.
Look at you, all in a snit.
Are you gonna watch me?
What is wrong with you?
Honestly, why is it that every time
a man takes you out to lunch around here,
youre... youre the dessert?
Thats terrible.
Its constant from every corner.
Im from Bay Ridge. We have manners.
Why cant they just leave it alone?
Because men always bother you all the time.
They follow you down the street.
Well, not exactly.
Look, dear, I dont know you that well,
but youre the new girl, and youre not much,
so you might as well enjoy it while it lasts.
Of course.
Dont be that way.
Im just offering some perspective, thats all.
Thank you, Joan.
Ill save my thank-yous
till you correct that correspondence.
I dont know why Im here.
Im... I mean, I do.
Im... nervous, I guess.
Anxious.
I dont sleep that well.
And my hands...
Well, theyre fine now.
Its like when you have a problem with your car
and you go to the mechanic and its not doing it anymore.
Not that you are a mechanic.
I guess a lot of people must come hereworried about the b*mb.
Is that true?
Its a common nightmare, people say.
I read it in a magazine.
My mother always told methat it wasnt polite to talk about yourself.
She passed away recently.
I guess I already said that.
Can I smoke in here?
Were all so lucky to be here.
Its  :  .
I have to go to Roys reading.
I have to be there to act surprisedwhen Jack Kerouac doesnt show.
Lock the door when you leave.
If youre gonna go home, take a shower.
You stink.
Its because Im a man.
You seem to forget that sometimes.
Im lucky they arent all like you.
Ill take that as a compliment.
What do women want?
Well, one of the things has to benot being asked something like that.
"What do women want?
You know better than to ask."
Give me a pen.
Jesus.
"What do women want?"
"Any excuse to get closer."
Thank God.
Theres that ego people pay to see.
Ill have the filet of sole.
Excellent.
Creamed spinach or creamed corn?
Spinach.
Fried potatoes or au gratin?
Au gratin. With tomato juice to start.
Ill have a goulash.
Very good, sir.
Vodka gimlet.
Old-fashioned.
How was your day?
Fine.
You know, I work with doctors.
Theyll say anything you pay them to.
Of course, dear.
Dinner in the city.
Im glad Im hungry.
I saw an interesting thing in the Journal American.
Apparently, the phone company
wants to start charging people for unlisted numbers.
That doesnt seem fair.
Some people agree with you,
and theyre giving aliases to Ma Bell.
They call it the nom-de-phone.
Isnt that smart?
Of course, most of them are pornographic.
The best one?
Pat McGroin.
Oh, my God.
Hard to believe they could print that
in the Journal American, let alone a phone book.
This is nice.
Ill be right up.
Hello.
Sorry to bother you so late.
Its Don Draper.
Oh, hello, Mr. Draper.
No, no. Its not too late at all.
Glad to hear that.
Well?
Well, I had a very interesting hourwith your wife this afternoon.
Shes a very anxious young woman.
I think youre doing the right thing.
