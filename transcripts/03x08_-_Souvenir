Ive prepared allof your correspondence,
and the summaries are herefor you to go over.
You can put them down.
Well, its just... Its 5:00.
Sorry about that.You probably want to be leaving.
What are you up to?
Well, some of the girls from here
and the travelers insurancegot a place in Saltaire.
- Mosquitoes.- They dont bother me.
Some people they bother,some people they dont.
- Im just one of those people.- A thing like that.
Is he making you workbecause hes got no place to go?
- No.- Have a wonderful weekend, dear.
Why is it that a man on his ownis an object of pity
when shes really the oneyou should feel sorry for?
I dont feel sorry for her.Those girls do whatever they want.
Still working, Campbell?Theres no reason to show off.
Coopers in Montana, Sterlings in Jane
- and Drapers on vacation.- Hes not on vacation.
Hes been in Dallas or Denver or something.Hilton sent him to every armpit he has.
Id like to get out of town in August once,even for work.
I love this time of year.
Its quiet. It used to be like thiswhen I was a kid all the time.
Id lie in bed at night, hear horses going by.
New York in August?Its like a great, big, melting wax museum.
Nothing but those fat girlswith the hairy armpits
putting their feet in the fountain.
You know what?My weekend doesnt look so bad now.
Ill take anybody for a drink who wants one.
I poured you a beer.
If you were wondering,theres a Hathaway in there.
- The hotel gave me someone elses shirt.- Then you should complain to Mr. Hilton.
- They should be paying you for this.- Theres a hearing,
and Im paid well enough already.
- What are they doing out there?- Catching lightning bugs.
You should join them.
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draperfrom the Junior League of Tarrytown
calling for Mrs. Howard Englewood.
Were trying to savethe Pleasantville Road Reservoir.
When do you expect them back?
Well, thats no good.
Yes, have a good evening.
Draper residence.
Just a minute. Don. Come on, Don.Its for you.
Its Mr. Hiltons office.
This is Don.
Okay. When?
Tuesday night.
Pan Am? Sure, send it to my office.
You as well.
- Where are you going now?- He wants me to fly out Tuesday night
- and join him in Rome.- Rome?
- Well, thats a lot better than Dallas.- Not for two days it isnt.
Ill see the Colosseum from a taxicab.
We shouldve gone to the beachfor the summer.
Youve been gone the whole time, anyway.
First of all, thats not true.
Second, theres nothing stopping youfrom coming with me.
- You have a passport.- I guess our two-month-old isnt an issue.
We can stay at the Waldorfanytime we want.
- Because thats just like Rome.- Sorry, Birdie.
I gotta catch up on my sleep.
- Okay, youre all set. Stand up.- I am.
Are you okay?
- Are you trying to get that in or out?- Its stuck.
- You work for the Lawrences, right?- Im very sorry.
- Youre their au pair, arent you?- Yes, but they will send me home.
First of all, lets take care of this.
- What happened?- I cant tell you.
- Yes, you can.- I cant.
Whats your name?
- Gudrun.- My name is Peter.
Im in 14G.And Im not going to get you in trouble.
I have this party and I borrowed her dressand this happened.
- No one can clean and shes coming home.- So you thought you would throw it away?
Theyre just going to think you stole it.Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on.
I dont think youre thinking clearly.
You could put it back in the closet,and when she takes it out,
blame it on the little kids.They have a girl, right?
I would never do this.
- When are they coming home?- Thursday.
- Give it to me.- For what?
Just give it to me.
- Let me see what I can do.- Are you sure?
- And people say New Yorks not friendly.- Thank you.
Now, Im not promising anything.Ill do my best.
Good night.
Weve read your statement, Mrs. Gumport,and we appreciate your concern.
- So where is he? Were next.- I dont know.
- Did he say he was coming?- I didnt speak to him exactly.
Maybe he sent a letter,a proclamation or something.
I believe that completes our old business.Move onto the new business on the agenda.
We will begin with addressing the gasstation signs on South Water Street.
Excuse me. I believe theres beena request for discussion
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.Its on the agenda.
Somehow that got shiftedinto new business.
Thats definitely old business.
- Who are you exactly?- Shes with me. Im Mrs. Jack Farrelly,
and were representingthe Junior League of Tarrytown.
- Would the trustees please locate the...- There should be two petitions there.
- Am I late?- No, youre just in time.
We have someonewhod like to speak on our behalf.
Yes.
Yes. Mayor, trustees.
Im Henry Francis, Governor Rockefellersdirector of public relations and research,
and Ive been sent here to deliver thisrequest on behalf of the governors office.
- Really?- Its a request that further study is needed,
because, as you know,this project was initiated
based on an assumption thatthe water quality of the reservoir is lacking.
I dont think that was an assumption.There was a study.
With all due respect,
the governors office believesthat was not conclusive.
- May I see that letter?- Ive brought copies for everyone.
Very well, Mr. Francis.
We appreciate the governors interestin our hamlet,
and do hereby order the developmentof the Pleasantville Road Reservoir
be suspended until further notice.
Calm down, ladies.I believe that completes our old business.
Move onto the new business on the agenda.
I am so impressed.
- So how long will that report take?- I have no idea,
but theres a saying in politics,"When you have no power, delay. "
- Betty says youre from around here.- Yeah, about 3 miles that way.
I have to get out of herebefore Florence Esterhazi comes out
- and reiterates the financial report.- I should be getting back as well.
- Are you driving to Albany?- No.
Well, Im this way.
- They say you cant fight city hall.- Good night, Francine.
Well, this is me.
No station wagon for you, I guess.
I have one. Its just, this was my fathers.I thought it would be good luck.
So.
So what?
Nothing.
Id love to buy you some coffee,but I dont think theres any place open.
I appreciate the offer,but I should be getting home.
I just want to say thank you.
You really...
You really did everything we wanted,and I know how busy you must be.
Well, I think youll findthat I put my heart into things
when somethings important to me.
Or someone.
That is a beautiful car.
He loved it.
I saw how happy you were in there.
- I was. I am.- And I thought, "Dear God.
"Did I have anything to do with that?"
Because that would make me happy.
You did.
- Good night.- Drive safely now.
Do you know what happenedto the Hilton cufflinks?
Theyre little Stetsons, sterling silver.
Theyre in my top drawer.Bobby was playing with them. Theyre fine.
- Look at that. Howd it go?- It went very well. We won.
We won, we won, we won!
- What time are you leaving?- Car comes at 5:45.
- Youre leaving from work?- Yes.
- So they just k*ll the whole development?- Not exactly.
We had completely forgotten this,
but theres a manfrom the governors office,
and he pointed outsomething wed forgotten,
which was that the whole projectwas based on the idea
that the waters no good up there anymore,which is a lie.
Its not true at all, not even a little.They just made it up.
So he ordered another study, you know,like a chemical analysis of the water,
and that could take years,so I think theyll move on.
They should just do it up in Newburgh.Its already disgusting.
Thats real politics.
Well, you know, when you donthave any power, you have to delay things.
Don.
Don.
- Im up. Im up.- No, its not time to wake up.
I want to come with you. Is it too late?
What? No.
- I can buy you a ticket at the airport.- Carla can watch them for a few days.
Sure, why not?
I know youll be working the whole time,but I just want to get on a plane.
Pardon me. Do you work here?
The mens room is exactly here,one floor down.
No, I dont need the mens room. I...
I cant return this. It has this stain here.
I spilled wine on itand my wife hasnt forgiven me,
and Id really appreciateif you could get me out of the doghouse.
Im sorry, but anyonecouldve sewn a tag in this and...
Do I look like someonewho wants to steal a dress?
- Ill pay for it.- And I was going to say if we did carry it,
it would be from last season,and I dont know that we still have it.
- Let me speak to the manager.- Of the entire store?
Of the republic of dresses.
Whoever can help me with this,because youre falling short.
Just a minute.
- May I help you?- Yes, I...
Joan! Is that you?
Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?
Im well. Thank you.
I was asking for the manager. I had no idea.
Well, Im just filling in.They needed some extra help.
- I get my pick before they get put out.- Isnt that smart?
- So how can I help you?- Well, I dont mean to be a bother,
I was just hoping someone could.Its this dress.
Trudy spilled wine on it.Shes beside herself.
I may have spilled the wine,
and I was hoping to exchange itor replace it,
whichever will get me outof the ladies dresses department.
May I?
It is our merchandise.
- This ones small. I dont see Trudy in a 10.- It doesnt fit great, but she loves it.
- Its very...- Its very summery.
Give me a moment.
Take this down to customer service.Theyll send someone to the stockroom.
- Itll be boxed up, but Im sure we have it.- Im willing to pay for it, of course.
- Its all taken care of.- Well, thats very generous.
Thank you. So how are you?
Never been better.How are things at the office?
Moneypenny hasnt self-destructed,
but its just a matter of time.And how are you?
I think I told you already. Im very well.Greg is just finishing up his residency.
Hes actually thinking abouta new specialty.
You know doctors.Whatevers the latest thing.
And what would that be?
Psychiatry.
Ill take the dress and you take that.
Thank you so muchfor getting me out of a scrape.
And Id appreciate it
if you should happen to run into Trudythat you be discreet.
The whole incident was fraught with drama.
Of course. This never happened.
Nice to see you again.
Wow.
Its beautiful.
- What is that smell?- Which one?
Its like rubber or diesel.
I can barely stand up.Let me see whats going on.
Sorry. I havent changed my money yet.
No, signore. Thank you.American dollar is very good.
Thank you.
$2, Don? Thats what he makes in a week.
Don, look.
- Im sorry. Is this the Drapers room?- Yes, this is Mrs. Draper.
Is it? Well, its high time I got to meet you.
This must be Mr. Hilton.
Connie. Please.
- Welcome to Rome.- Thank you. Im happy to be here.
I want you to put my staffthrough its traces.
No complaints too small.Id kick you up to a suite,
but I want Don to see the way this worksfor most people.
- Its lovely.- When I see you tonight,
I want to hear all about it.
I so, so appreciate this.Its an hour or two at the most.
The board is trying to jap uswith a sudden meeting.
Ernie, Im leaving!
Youre drinking alone.This is, in Rome, not in the law.
Whiskey, neat.
- May I join you?- Yankee. Hey, go home.
Its an American millionaire.
- Are they making fun of me?- A little bit.
Im only in Rome for one night.I wont have my heart broken.
- Room 763.- Thats right near my room.
Good night, signorina.
- To whatever they were saying.- They said you were ugly.
Does that bother you?
You think because of the way Im dressedthat Im shallow?
I was just hoping you were easy.
- They said that, too.- What brings you to Rome?
Seen anything interesting?
- I could take it or leave it.- Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?
Connie, this is my wife, Betty.
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.
By golly, hes nutty.
Hes something.
He adores you.
Youre tiny.
He does.
Now I can seewhat all the fuss has been about.
He sees great things in you.
- Where are we going?- Were going for ice cream.
Thats a grand idea.
Close your window.My hair is getting mussed.


- How was your day?- Okay.
- Do I look pretty?- I guess so.
Hey, what are you doing?
Sally and Ernie sitting in a tree.
K- I-S-S-I-N-G...
Shut up! I mean it!
First comes love...
- Shut up!- Then comes...
Stop it!
- I said shut up!- Hey, hey, hey! Thats enough!
- She hurt me.- He hit me first.
- She was kissing Ernie.- I was not!
All right! Both of you, separate rooms.
Im not gonna let Ernie and Jessicavisit anymore.
Well, arent you a lucky girl?Go ahead, open it. Make sure its right.
Its like new!
They just exchanged it. No questions asked.
Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Peter, from my heart.
- I promise I never do this again.- Its all right. It never happened.
We should celebrate.
- I dont know.- What do you like to drink?
Youre German, right?I can get us some beer or a Riesling.
Schnapps?
You are so nice,
but I have my boyfriend.
Thank you so much to do this for me.
Glad I could help.
Good night.
- I woke you.- What do you want?
I went to a lot of troubleto solve your dress problem,
and I think I at least deserveto see it on you.
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.
- This is cozy.- Ill go get the dress.
Id like to kiss you.
- Hello?- Did I wake you?
- No. No, Im up.- Can I interest you two in some breakfast?
Breakfast? Sure, let me just...
Stay.
You know, Connie, Bettys telling me shealready ordered breakfast up to the room.
- Can I meet you afterwards?- Of course.
You let me knowhow you like the room service.
- Did you hear the bells this morning?- I did.
I like sleeping on this side of the bed.
I have to get up.
Order something. He wants a full report.
Well, hello.
Welcome home.
- How is everybody?- Everyones fine. How was your trip?
It was short but sweet.
Well, good. Im going to get my things.
Just one more thing.
- You might want to talk to Sally.- Why?
- Shell tell you.- Carla, you brought it up.
I keep talking to her about that temper.
Im gonna go check the mail.Do you want anything?
She kissed Ernie Hanson. Bobby wasteasing her, and she really went after him.
Okay. Its okay.
- Thank you for telling me.- I think they just missed you.
Wouldnt that be nice?
Well, I missed you. You know that?
Mr. Campbell. Ed Lawrence, 14C.
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?
- Is your wife at home?- No.
- Can I come in for a minute?- Of course.
- What are you drinking, Ed?- I have a martini waiting next door.
Let me make this quick.
You know we have this German au pairworking for us?
- No, I didnt know that.- Yes, you do.
- I dont know what she said...- Please, just relax.
I know its August and all the cats are away,
but I just spent one of my preciousvacation days refilling the Kleenex boxes.
- I dont understand.- Would you drop it?
Ive had four months without any tears,Mr. Campbell. Four quiet months.
You know how hard it is to find someonemy wife can get along with?
And now this.
Look, there are plenty of nanniesin this neighborhood.
Stay away from her.In fact, be smart. Stay out of the building.
- Im very sorry.- Itll be fine.
Enjoy the rest of your summer.
- Bobby, sit down.- Mayday! Mayday!
Daddy doesnt know,
but Carla told me you were fightingwhile we were gone.
Sally.
- Carla was very upset.- Its not fair. I didnt do anything.
Thats it. You apologize to Bobbyand you learn to control your temper,
or Im going to haveto start taking things away.
- Im sorry I hit you.- Thats okay.
I called the office. Hilton sent a packet overbefore we even left.
Im sorry.
- Going swimming?- Are we?
Yes.
See you tonight.
Yes, but what you really wouldve enjoyed
was watching my father strugglewith the sailboat.
Well, hello.
Hello.
- Is everybody having a good summer?- Very nice. Very hot.
I see Marta came.Or did you keep it this way yourself?
- I did my best.- My little bachelor. Come over here.
I missed you.
I missed every part of you.
- Trudy, I have to get to work.- I dont care.
Peter.
You always get that guilty lookon your face when we see little children.
I told you.
I dont care.
Youre my husband. I want what you want.
Did you miss me? A little?
Whats wrong?
Peter. Look at me. Did something happen?
- Sally, get down here.- Coming.
I want you to know that I thinkErnie Hanson is a very nice little boy,
but I dont want you running aroundjust kissing boys.
- I wasnt.- And you dont kiss boys. Boys kiss you.
The first kiss is very special.
But I already did it. Its over.
Youre going to have a lot of first kisses.
Youre going to want it to be special,so you remember.
Its where you go from being a strangerto knowing someone,
and every kiss with him after thatis a shadow of that kiss.
Do you understand?
I think so.
Go play.
- Hello.- Hello.
I made some cold salads,hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.
Wonderful.
- Do you want a drink?- No.
I walked down Lexingtonand they opened a new fruit market,
but other than the melons,most of it was unremarkable,
so I stopped in Butterfield Market
and they had all of the stone fruitsand beautiful cherries and I thought...
- Trudy.... maybe Id make a fruit salad for dessert.
What?
I dont want you to go away anymorewithout me.
Good. I wont.
Tell me, what happened at work today?
Well, Kinsey invented some contraption
that can sh**t a water balloonacross the office.
- We filled it with ketchup.- Did you?
I have $5 for Carla.She watched the kids for me.
The board called a secret meetingabout the reservoir.
- I think they reversed us.- Really?
Well see.
- So did you go to the catacombs?- No.
Throw a coin in the fountain?
- You did have a good time, didnt you?- You want some?
The kids didnt eat it at all.I put them to bed.
Carlton and I went to Lake Georgefor a week after Jess was born.
No problems, no kids.
It was magical.
We have to do that again.
Im afraid we may have to be vigilantabout the reservoir.
Although, itd be an excuse for youto get more help from high places.
Im done with that. We made our stand.
Sunny Madrid. Doesnt that soundlike it would do the trick?
Ive never been.
- Welcome home.- Hello, Francine.
Well, I should be going.
From what I hear,you two must be very tired.
Good night, Francine.
- Hey.- Dont.
- Whats wrong?- Whats wrong?
I hate this place. I hate our friends.
- I hate this town.- Betts.
Well go away again. You know we will.
Do me a favor. Look on your pillow.
Open it.
I saw it in the gift shop,
but we were leaving,so I had Connie send it.
Its lovely.
Ill have it put on your bracelet.
Then I can have something to look at
when I tell the storyabout the time we went to Rome.
