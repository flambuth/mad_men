I didnt want to play cards anyway.
I was supposed to talk to Dunphy,but hes sick again.
You know,the other top salesman in my department,
he reads all day long,
and Im out here on the trainhustling people.
Im really having a lean month.
Okay, Howard, I knew this day would come.
Look, I already have life insurance.
It came with my junior partnership.
And its six times my annual salary,
and after two years, it covers su1c1de.
So make your pitch brief.
Are you kidding me?
What?
Look, I wasnt gonna put the arm on you,
but you have a kid.
I guarantee youthat policy pays the company and not you.
Imagine everything you havejust stopped short
the minute they put you in the ground.
I dont think youre right about that.
Oh, Im positive.
Forget it.
Ill leave that to youand your sleepless nights.
Im surprised youre not doing better.
- You like my new tie?- Yes.
You know what a new tie means?
It means I have a spectacularnew side dish in the city.
Strawberry blonde.Tiny thing with huge tits.
Twenty-fourth floor, 24-years-old.
I got an apartment.
Whats your wife saying?
Shes happy because I provide for her.
Shes not worriedabout what might happen to her
if something happens to me.
Arent you worriedyoure going to get caught?
Ill be right back.
I have a Jack Shapiro calling for you.
Well, for Megan Calvet.
Thank you so much, Dawn.
So sh*t for sh*t, its A Hard Days Night,
as these screaming girlsincrease in numbers
until our mop-top in the white leatherjacket
ducks into the Chevalier Blanc Pub.
Notice the white chess piece.
Then were inside and were in color,
but theres even more girls.
The music cuts and they stare at him
like at the end of The Birds.
"You may have second thoughtsabout wearing Chevalier Blanc.
"Its more trouble than its worth."
So weve been looking for a piece of music.
It really hasto have that sound that the movie has.
Well, that sound is the b*at,
who you said are impossible to get.
Oh, dont worry.Theres a million bands that sound like that.
Or well make our own.
AII we want is the chaos and the fun,
that sort of adolescent joy.
We know what the b*at sound like.Well do our best.
Great.
Well, well get back to you on thatand the schedule.
Great seeing you both.
You, too.
Make sure in the casting
that this guy is more like Calvin than Rick.
Usually you haveto go to one of your finer mens rooms
to find a man like Rick.
So nothing about the applause?
It was their idea.
Now what about the song?
Like I said, theres a million of them.
Hermans Hermits, Chad & Jeremy,The b*at, The Zombies.
You really think the Zombies are right?Its gotta be right.
You know what, Ill ask Megan. Shell know.
You wanted to see me?
See anything you like?
- Are you asking if I ski?- No.
I want to know which skis you want.Or take them both.
Do they explode or something?
Yes, Allen Funt sent them over.
Do you want them or not?Because they want you.
- The skis do?- Roger OHara took it upon himself
as head of the Head Ski Company
to demand your handlingof his account over my lunch.
- Really?- Yes.
Youre making quite a name for yourself.
Why are you telling me this?
Relax. Its good.
Its what Ive always wanted.
Sit back, let the business roll inwhile you pass the jug
with some schmoefrom Lutherville, Maryland.
Go on, take them.
Yes.
I suppose I will.
And I got to see that.
Where have you been hiding all day?I was about to leave.
Ive been working. I thought you were, too.
Nope.
Why dont you come with me,
dress up another drab client dinner?
- Don...- Hey, let me ask you something.
When did music become so important?
Its always been important.
I mean jingles, yeah.
But now everybody keeps coming in,looking for some song.
And theyre so specific.
You love specific.
But I have no ideawhats going on out there.
Well, no one can keep up.Its always changing.
Were going to Dannys Hideaway.
You have to go and I have to work.
See you at home?
I promise.
Youre leaving late.
Is it snowing out there?
No. Sporting goods account.
And theyre already giving us presents.Thats good.
Theyre giving me presents,and Ive never even met them.
Are you a really good skier? Like famous?
Well, good night.
I thought we were working.
Don just called.I have to meet him for dinner.
Nothing I can do about that, I guess.
You can go home, too.
I dont know. Theyre not right.
Theyre exactly as you dictated them to me.
Theyre exactly like theyre supposed to be,
but theyre not it.
Maybe they are.
Go ahead.
Thanks. Good night.
- Im sorry.- Excuse me?
You didnt happen to seeHoward Dawes on the train?
Are you Beth?
Yes.
He talks about you often.
Im sorry, he doesnt talk about anyoneto me.
Peter Campbell.
We should switch cars.
I dont know how Im gonnaget these in there.
Except I locked my keys inside.
He should have been home by now,
and Im afraid maybehe fell asleep on the train.
Hes done that before.
Now that I think of it,
I saw some fellow corner himin the Oyster Bar.
He may be a while.
I can notify a locksmithfor the car and the house.
Can you just drive me home?
The house is open.Ill deal with this in the morning.
Next time we turn, Ill warn you.
Whens the next train?
You know what? Ill give you my number.
And when Howard calls from the station,
Ill shuttle him home.
Hes not coming home.Hes staying in the city.
We got an apartment.
"We."
Youre enough of a strangerthat Ive never heard your name,
yet you know where he is and I dont.
I dont know anything.
Did you know that was a stop sign?
Youre an awful driver.
Are you from Manhattan?
Yes. And I just learned.
I could never live in the city.
Whats wrong with it?
Well, I love it,but all the hobos and the panhandlers...
There arent that many.
Well, they always accost me.
I think its because I make eye contact.
And then I always give them money,
and I cant stop thinking about themfor the rest of the day.
Wandering around, sleeping in doorways.
When I was little, I tried to make my fathergive one money and he wouldnt.
He said,"We couldnt take care of everybody."
I guess were supposed to get usedto not seeing them.
Yes.
Thats exactly what happens.
Hello?
Its me. Is Megan there?
Isnt she with you?
Yes, were playing a hilarious joke on you.
She left a while agoto meet you at the restaurant.
When?
I dont know. After you called.
I didnt call.
She must be at home.
Im at home.
Maybe she went to the restaurant
and missed youand now shes on her way home.
I dont know where she is.Do you know where Abe is?
Goodbye, Peggy.
Its a lovely house.
Is it harder to lie to menow that you know me?
Howard is working, Im sure of it.
I dont even think hed careif I was alive or dead.
Im sorry, but youre being very dramatic.
You drove me home. Now leave me alone.
Im not leaving until Im sureyoure not hysterical.
You dont know what youre doing.
You just want to get back at him.
Dont you want me?
You can have me.
Are you really worriedthat Howards coming home?
Hello?
Hello? Peggy?
Pizza House.
I used to be like this.
What do you mean?
Just reckless.
I cant believe that happened.
Say something.
Ive had men paying attention to mesince before it was appropriate.
They dont care what I say.
They just watch my lips move.
Im listening to every word you say.
Your irises are so blue and round.
Have you seen those picturesof the earth from space?
I have.
Ill take that as a compliment.
It didnt bother youto see the earth tiny and unprotected,
surrounded by darkness?
So you dont like my eyes?
This can never happen again.
What?
No, of course. I...
No, I mean it.
- Okay.- You should get home.
I dont want to leave you here.
Why not? Im fine now.
Im going to have a snack and go to bed.
I dont want to leave you.
Thank you for the ride home.
- Hello.- Hi.
Where were you?
Peggy said I called youand you were going to meet me?
I went out for a drink with Joey and Troy.
Had to lie to Peggy to get out of there.
Ive done that.
Im hungry. Im going to get some crackersor something.
- You want anything?- No.
- Good morning.- Morning.
Im sorry. I had no idea he was gonna call.
Its not what you think.
Dont put me in that position again.
I cannot lie to him.
- I lost a nights work. I couldnt sleep...- Would you stop?
A friend of mine knows somebodydoing an off-off-Broadway show.
I read on the weekend,
and then I got a callback last nightand I didnt want to miss it.
But I didnt get it, so thats it.Its done.
Why cant you tell Don?
Tell Don I still want to be an actress?
Do you?
I know copywritings hard,
but youre doing great.
You shouldnt give up.
I wouldnt tell you thisif I didnt think you had talent.
The other day they asked meto take Stans originals down to the printer,
and I thought all I have to dois throw these in the trash and theyll fire me
or at least theyd yell at meand I could cry enough and quit.
And then I realized theyll never fire me.
You want to quit?
I dont know. What do I do?
You know there are peoplek*ll to get this job.
Youre taking up a spotand you dont even wanna do it?
Im sorry I told you.
You didnt. I caught you.
And then you act like you want advice,
but youve obviouslyalready made up your mind.
Because hes so easy to talk to?
Well, you cant keep lying to him.
Its so simplewhen its someone elses life, isnt it?
Youre right. I dont care what you do.
Phil Beachum is not just the boss,hes the head of desserts.
Head of desserts?Please tell me hes 300 pounds.
Hes big, just not as big as youd like.
Anyway, Pat Wallace loved the wayyou and Megan...
You know, your banter.
- Dawn, wheres Megan?- Shes not coming.
Im sorry.
I was just saying how Pat Wallaceloved the Mr. And Mrs. Draper bit.
And youre gonna go to the test kitchen,
taste a couple of different formulationsof Cool Whip,
and maybe put on a little show to his boss,
you know, as a courtesy.
So, Don, if you could bring everybodyup to speed.
Well, I dont knowwhat anybody knows about Cool Whip.
I read a 30-page dossier
that fails to use the words,"Fake whipped cream."
Because its a non-dairy whipped topping
that comes frozenand then melts into this miracle.
Just do the bit.
Okay.
Honey, I dont even think I want dessert.
- You love dessert.- You love dessert,
and you just want me to have someso you can have some.
I made two.
- What is it?- Its Cool Whip.
- It looks like whipped cream.- Just taste it.
- Is it a topping?- Well, you can have it on ice cream like this
or on fruit or cake
orjust by itself.
- Just taste it.- So its a dessert?
- Just taste it.- Is it sweet?
Just taste it.
Thats it. Thats the line. "Just taste it."
People are gonna be yelling itat the TV set.
- Its adorable, right?- Its a nice twist
on the stupid husband and pushy wifebecause they actually like each other.
Are you going to be in the ads?
No. I tried. Theyre not interested.
Cool Whips not interestedor Don and Megan arent interested?
Were not interested.
- Dont you like it?- No, I do.
Just absorbing it.
Hello?
Beth?
Its Peter.
I know who it is.
I want you to get on a trainand meet me in the city.
- Anywhere.- No.
Just a minute.
What do you want?
Nothing. You came over to me.
You opened the door.
Are you still there?
Was your secretary on the line?
No. Im at a pay phone.
Youre taking away all my fears.
I mean, suddenly I dont think about the factthat you ride with my husband
on the train twice a dayand that you live 20 minutes away
and Id see your wife at the market,if I ever went.
I know, I know.
Are you sorry I called?
Just... Stop.
Enjoy the memory. Leave it alone.
I mean, fantasize about it. I will, too.
But... Dont call me again.
Don.
Whats the matter?
I have to talk to you.
Whats wrong?
I lied to you last night.
Okay.
I told you that I went for a drink,but I didnt.
I had a call-back for a play.
Okay. So?
I feel really bad about lying to you.
And now youre telling me.
- You do that a lot?- Audition?
- No, lie to me.- No.
- Did you get it?- What?
No. No, I didnt.
But it was incredible, Don.
I think I was pretty close.
My heart was racing.
I mean, Im rusty.
I need to go back to class,
but I realized something.
- What?- I miss acting.
I think I gave up too easy,
and I dont even know how I stopped.
I never made a decision, thats for sure.
We cant be in the Cool Whip ad.
Its bad for business.
No. I just keep thinking
I could be on Broadway or off-Broadway
or, I dont know, films, even.
Sweetheart...
Sometimes we dont get to choosewhere our talents lie.
I mean, what you did with Heinz,
it took me years to be ableto think that way.
Well, I cant explain it,
but I felt better failing in that audition
than I did when I was succeeding at Heinz.
Because that was aboutmaking the client happy.
Wait till you walk down the streetand see the work on a wall or on TV.
Thats when you feel something.
Do you know that I cant even standgoing to the theater anymore
because all I feel is envy?
And I know the next thing is bitterness,
and I dont want to feel that.
Okay. So what do you want to do?
I mean, theres no guarantee.
And Im so grateful.
This gave me so much confidence.
But I never tried as hard at acting
as I did at advertising.
And itll never be for mewhat it is for you.
Look, I know its uncomfortablefor you with me there.
Theres a shadow over everything.
I put you in a terrible position.
There are 20 firmsthat would be glad to have you.
I dont want to do it, Don.
You dont want to do it?
Im sorry.
Since I was a little girl,its all I ever dreamed about.
I understand.
I dont want to keep you from your dream.
Youre so good to me.
So what do you want to do?
I mean, you woke me upin the middle of the night.
Its obviously some sort of emergency.
Well, I can finish up my workand then help train the new person.
You want to train somebody? No.
Well go in tomorrowand youll say goodbye to everybody
and well get you on your way.
Really?
Its what you want.
I dont know what to say.
I love you.
I love you, too.
- Morning.- Morning.
Megans quitting.
Yes. So I think todaysgoing to be her last day.
Okay.
How do you do this?
Do you want to have a seat?
Its not like that, Joan.
Shes up for a part in a play,and even if she doesnt get it,
shes decided to go backto acting full time.
Well, Im sure shell be wonderful.
Do we make an announcement?Do we have a party?
Whats the protocol?
Why dont we have the girlstake her to lunch?
I mean, shes not disappearing, is she?
No, shes not.
Don, Ill take care of it.
There you are.
Yep, been here for a while.
Well, I wanted to tell everyone, actually.
Megan, are you okay?
Im not going to be working here anymore,
and its really hard to tell everybody.
Hey! Megans talking to you.
Go ahead.
Im so sorry.
Im not going to work here anymore.
Did he fire you? That son of a bitch!
No.
No, Im going back to try acting again.
- Are you kidding me?- Stan.
- No, Id better get used to it.- I was...
- Im gonna miss you.- Me, too.


Acting is fascinating.Its probably easier for girls.
But let me ask you,do they always give you clothes
or do you have to do it in your own clothes?
I dont know. Yes, they give you a costume.
- Shoes, too?- Yes.
Break a leg.
See you around.
I think Im in the middleof a lot of things,
but Don told methat I was just supposed to hand it over.
Are you sure about this?
Peggy...
Ive always appreciatedwhat youve done for me,
not just yesterday.
I should see Joan.
That takes a lot of guts.
Ill tell you what takes guts...
Never having money for lunch.
She owes me, like, $15 at this point.
What am I gonna do, ask Don? Call her?
I think its clear why she left.
- Thats not why.- Well, why?
Come on, reality got her.
You work your ass off for months,bite your nails, for what?
Heinz Baked Beans.
Why are you so late?
I missed the early train.
Megans gone. She quit.Shes gonna be an actress.
Joan just told me, like, five minutes ago.
Is that so?
It doesnt shock you?
No, not really.
What about Don?
Please. They do whatever they want,even to Draper.
Well, the good news is
we dont have to lookover our shoulders anymore,
wondering what shes gonna tell him.
They work it over in their minds,
turn it off and on when they feel like it,
and were just there, waiting at attention.
Its not the way its supposed to be.
Trudy pregnant again?
Have you seen those pictures of earthfrom space?
Of course.
Do they make you feel smalland insignificant?
No, Jennifer does that.And Im not small, Pete.
Dont knowif youve ever heard that about me.
Save it for your convention whores.
Hey, keep it down.
Im asking you a serious question.
I like the pictures of the earth.I find them to be majestic.
Why do they give you a glimmer of hopein the midst of rejection?
A little thread to hang on to,
a misplaced word,a suggestion of the future.
Under a court of law,it would look like an accident,
but its not.
So were not talking about Megan,and were not talking about Trudy.
Why do they get to decidewhats going to happen?
They just do.
So enjoy your lunch.
Ill see you after. I have to get my box.
Do you really wanna come back hereand do this again?
Ill bring it home.
Thank you.
Ill see you at home.
You will.
Hey, chief, good news.
Rick from Chevalier found a song they likefor the Hard Days Night spot.
Bet its his boyfriends favorite.
Help yourself.
I think it works pretty well.
Not that it matterswhen they send it over, right?
- Are you kidding me?- Why am I listening to this?
You know we cant get the b*at.
Its not the b*at.
This songs, like, 30-years-old.
But its happy and its fun.
And Don thought it was the b*at.
- And they like it.- Turn it off.
Its stabbing me in the f*cking heart.
Why are you cursing?
- Can you excuse us?- Sure.
Were due at the test kitchen tomorrow.
And theyre expecting...
What do you want to do?We can just cancel it.
Were not canceling. Tell them Megans sick.Peggy will do it.
Sure. Ill let her know.
I wasnt expecting to see you.
Yeah, well, tonight I go home,
have dinner with the wife,everythings in balance.
You know, Howard, I talked to my office
and it turns out you were rightabout my policy,
so I let them set me up with a broker.
Well, whyd you do that?You didnt even give me a chance.
Im telling you, arent I?
I got all the paperwork at my house.
I can go home, have some supper,and stop by later.
Well, our babys been sick.
You know, I could just stop by right now.
- Beths a great cook.- Is she?
We missed you at Megans lunch.
I guess you have some extra work.
No. I told her Id rathergo to my own lunch with her.
Im not gonna lie, I did not see it coming.
I thought she would fail here.
I feel bad.
I think maybe I was harder on her,
scared her away.
Second wives,its like they have a playbook.
I dont think shes like that.
Peggy, shes going to be a failing actresswith a rich husband.
No, I think shes good at everything.
I think shes just one of those girls.
Then you had every right to be hard on her.
Did you know thathe met Betty Draper doing a print ad?
Did you know she was a model?
Thats the kind of girl Don marries.
Good night.
Beth? Honey?
I dont know where the hell my kids are.
Hello. You have a lovely home.
This is my friend, Pete, from the train.
He has, believe it or not,an insurance emergency.
- I really dont want to be an intrusion.- Its fine.
Weve always got room for one more.
- Where are the kids?- At my mothers.
Now, dont tell me. Youre...
Thirty-two.
Ill be at the Hotel Pennsylvania at 12:30.
No.
I dont want that.
Then throw it out.
Your old man died young,but in a plane crash, right?
Thats right.
Howard, may I speak with you?
Where are you going?
Shes got a migraine.
Its baked chicken.
- I can set a table.- I dont know.
Youve got me in a little trouble here.
Dont run away.
Okay.
You shouldnt cook in bare feet.
Hello.
Dont get used to this because there isgoing to be a lot of crying from rejection.
No, Ill try and hold it together.
Beef bourguignon. Taste.
Its hot as hell.
I thought for sure youd come home drunk.
Megan...
Its okay.
Do you wanna fix yourself a drink?
Don...
I love you.
Youre everything I had hoped youd be.
You, too.
Theyre arranged invarying degrees of sweetness,
the sweetest at the end.
Its like cheese.
You have to try the Camembertbefore the Gorgonzola.
And we have to use clear bowls
because everybodyused to pick the blue one.
Go ahead, Sarah will take notes.
Well start with your thoughts, Ken.
Well, I cant imagine ittasting any better than that.
Welcome to the Creative Cookery Kitchen.
You know,I always like to say youre in for a treat,
but today it sounds like we are.
Hows it going? Did I miss anything?
- They just sampled "A."- And?
Its not whipped cream,but its delicious on its own.
- Now you answer your wife, right?- What?
Listen, Phil, Dons wife is sick.
This is Peggy. Shes the copywriter.
- Really?- Itll be just as good.
Go ahead.
- Honey.- Yes, dear?
I was just going to say
I dont even think I want dessert.
Well, I made two.
Dont do that.
Dont you wanna know what it is?
- Its Cool Whip.- Thats right, its Cool Whip.
Just try it.
Honey, is that really what you want?
Yes, I want you to try it.
Dont you want me to taste it?
Yes, just taste it.
Why? Is it a topping?
Yes, and you can put it on ice cream
and cake and fruit.
So its a dessert, then?
Just try it already.
Just taste it.
Well...
- Thank you.- Thank you.
- Thank you.- A pleasure.
Well talk soon.
Ill be right back.
I am so thirsty.
Look, I think you did great.
It wasnt what it was about anyway.
They know were going to cast it.
You think the actresscan remember to say, "Just taste it?"
You didnt want to rehearse.You ran it through one time half-assed.
Look, Ive done it a bunch. I knew my lines.
Do you think Megan would come backand do it in the office?
- Megan is not the problem.- You didnt want her there!
You were threatenedby everything about her.
I spent more time training her than you didand eight months defending her.
Defending her? She was great at it!
She thinks advertising is stupid.
No, she thinks the people she worked withare cynical and petty.
- Listen...- I did everything right,
and I am still getting it from you.
You know what?You are not mad at me, so shut up!
Im sorry, you cant smoke in here.
- For Gods sake, are you avoiding me?- Yes.
What happened?
Shes following her dream.
Thats admirable.
I gotta say, I can see her as an actress.
Not that shes insincere, but, you know.
Shes very sincere.
I sure as hell didnt get to choosewhat I wanted to do.
- My father told me.- I was raised in the 30s.
My dream was indoor plumbing.
You know what? She wants to have a baby.
This is just the beginning of her process.
I dont know.I suggested that path on our honeymoon.
She said my kids were enough.
Jane wanted a baby,
but I thought, "Why do that to somebody?"
Why shouldnt she do what she wants?
I dont want her to end up like Betty.
Or her mother.
You gotta go home,let her know that theres a routine.
Itll keep you both out of trouble.
Monas dad told me that.
I was afraid I was going to leave for classand miss you.
You said you didnt knowwhat was going on.
I bought you the latest b*at album.
Start with this one.
Have fun.
