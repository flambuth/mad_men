How is fishing competitive?Man versus fish?
- No.- Morning.
Man versus man.The weighing, the measuring.
Got to respect anythingthat rewards you for silence.
Come on.
Morning, all.
My mother always saidgood news could wait.
But I spent an hour and a halfon the phone last night
with my new best friend Victorat the New York Times.
Gonna get a paper route?
No, theyre doingsome literary profile on hip agencies.
Hep.
After an hour ofinvading the details of my life...
You shouldnt start it with the Mayflower.
Anyway, I told him to get in touch with you.
He wants to see what weve been up to.
Ill have Joan put it together.
And dont worry about an interview.
He seemed to beonly interested in talking to me.
Sterling Campbell Draper Pryce.May I help you?
And this one.
Thatll do it.
Peggy really got buried with Heinz.
Yes, they are mostly Mr. Ginsberg.
Look at all the great workyouve done as creative director.
Look at all these voices, all this talent.
You really should put the letter in there.
Should I? That was a year ago.
As far as the world knows,it wasnt really an ad.
Its something to talk about.
Were still suffering for it.
Might as well get something out of it.
Leave em.
See? Because playing with a promakes you worse.
Makes you self-conscious.
Look, J.C., you golf with me,youre gonna win every time.
No, because Im terrible.
Okay.
Get Max Rosenberg on the phone.
I thought your tailor was Italian.
I met him at the Javits fundraiser.
Hes got a piece of business.Its a Jewish wine.
Why not bring it up at new business?
Why?
Dont you think were capableof doing this on our own?
Mr. Campbell is very good for our business,
but this requires your finesseand, frankly, your Semitic wife.
Bert, how do you not knowIm getting a divorce?
Not Mona, Jane.
Jane and I are getting divorced.
Already?
How Jewish are they?
You know, Fiddler on the Roof,audience or cast?
The company is Manischewitz.Max will know.
You cant blink.
Try to keep your eyes openso the sting from the air comes in.
Like this.
Daddy, dont forget the colored pencils.
Whining is not gonna get you anything.
Im crying because I need them so badlyfor my family tree project.
- Dinners at 7:00?- Youre gonna work all day?
Its 3:30.
- Bye, boys.- Bye-bye.
Howd you do that?
Just keep em wide open and think aboutsomething that makes you sad.
Theyre probably tying their shoes.Thats what it always is.
I cant sit here all day.
I thought you could park anywhere.
Betty, Im not an ambulance.Were double-parked.
What do you think youre doing, pal?
Okay. Jesus.
Just go get em. Ill circle.
The doorman said you were downstairs.
- Wheres Megan?- I dont know. In the bathroom.
Hurry up, get everybody.
Bobby, Gene, Moms here.
Come on.
We were waiting.
And they buzzed you.
Henrys double-parked.
Im sorry. Ive lost track of the time.
Dons late.
This is quite an apartment.
Thank you.
I think youve seen most of it.
- Bobby, come on.- Ill go get them.
Daddy was supposed to bringthe colored pencils.
Ill buy you some. Lets go.
Okay, goodbye.
Bye.
This is irritating.
Ill see you in two weeks.
Goodbye.
A trail of Sno Ballsleading to bigger sales.
A frozen machinethat makes money for vendors.
Now, if its for the customers, the kids,
do they get to work the machine?
Find out.
A snowman
on the beach.
A Sno Balls chance in hell.
They dont melt.
Theyre refreshing for the damned.
Theyre sinful.
The Sno Ball is the sinthat gets you into hell.
Theyre sinfully delicious.
Jesus, not bad.
Just put Gene to bed. Ill be right up.
Everyone loves the cartoonsin The New Yorker.
And I thought we could do that kind
with the guy crawling across the Saharadying of thirst,
the long beard, the tattered shirt.
Only theres four guys,
and each one hasa thought bubble above him.
"Water, water,
"water, Sno Ball."
- Whats the line?- Doesnt need one.
Well, if you want tostay with the New Yorkerthing,
maybe some kind of cryptic joke.
- I already have the joke.- Okay. Your turn.
As much as I hatefollowing another comedian,
Sno Ball, because its for kids,
demands a big, loud joke.
"Hit me in the face with a Sno Ball"is the tag.
And the picture is someonegetting hit in the face with a snowball.
Not the drink, an actualround, white, messy snowball.
And when I say someone, I mean a cop,
school teacher with glasses,businessman, Indian chief.
Anybody kids hate. And maybe a pig.
Why a pig?
I dont know, but everybody laughed.
Great, so thats a way to go.
I agree.
Also, Sno Ball comes with its own sloganbecause when you think of a snowball,
theres a 90 % chanceyou think of its chance in hell.
Right. Thats true.
So I picture this devil
with a mischievous smile on his face,
sipping a Sno Ballin front of the flames of hell.
The cup is beading with condensation.
And in your head you hear his voice,
"Yes, even me."
Thats actually good.
Im glad I could surprise you.
No, its just damn impressive
you could not write for so longand come back with that.
Its good to know.
Thank you.
- Its great.- Im working on the line.
Ill do the rest of it.Thats the easiest part to change.
So lets run with both of these.
May I?
Judy Steckler, half-pound loss.
Thats so good. We both had a good week.
I dont know what happened.I just wasnt that hungry this week.
Stop it. Youre here. You came.
This meeting can startto define what is a good week
and a bad week in our lives.
But there are good weeks and bad weeksfor thin people, too.
Coming to Weight Watchersis not just a chance
to feel better about yourself.
Its a chance to share so that if,for example,
youre someone like me,you dont stuff yourself
just to keep from tellingyour family your problems.
How was your week, everybody?
Betty?
Well, I had a bad week out there
after having a good week in here.
Could you stand up, sweetheart?
I, you know, had
a very trying experience.
I was in an unfamiliar place and I saw...
Felt a lot of things I wish I hadnt.
And I lost a half a pound.
And I feel like I shouldpat myself on the back
because it was really hard.
We always talk about our goal in pounds,
but thats not all it is, is it?
Thank you, Betty.
Anyone else? Katherine with a "k."
Burke Devlin will never be a strangerin Collinsport. Just do what youre told.
But the way he looks at Vicky...I know what that means.
Who was she to him, Mr. Collins?
Ive heard her name too many times.
What could that miserableschoolmarm offer him that I cant?
Ill k*ll myself! I will!
Who the hell is this woman?
Shes a new character.
Shes a cook and shes in love.
Shes insane. She needs a drink.
They want you to be emotional.
You havent even seen the show.
Ive seen a soap opera.I dont think Ive seen one this bad.
And isnt this supposed to be scary?
I didnt come for an acting lesson,but thank you for making me more nervous.
Come on, we used tolaugh about this together.
Youll go in and turnthat chuck into tenderloin.
You know what? Its just so easy for youfrom your throne on 73rd and Park.
Some of us act for a livingand we wait tables when we dont.
- Thats not fair.- No, it isnt.
What do you want me to say?
That Id k*ll for an auditionin this piece of crap?
I would. Are you happy?
Look, Im sorry. Im nervous.
I havent had a job in a whileand youre lucky, thats all.
I am.
Ive got to go. Ive got a shift.
What should I bring for Thanksgiving?
Something sweet.
Mr. Ginsberg is here to see you.
I like the connect the dots.Whats it end up being?
Actually, its reminiscentof certain experiences for some people.
Have a seat.
Michael, can you keep a secret?
Nope.
I need you to do some work for meon a prospective account.
It will involve a client dinner.
And m*rder.
Youre not going to dinner.
What I need from you is a couple of ideasfor a company called Monarch Wines.
The brand is Manischewitz.
- You assume that Im Jewish.- Stop talking.
They make wine for Jews.
And now theyre making onethey want to sell to normal people.
You know what I mean, people like me.
I think theyre open to anything,
but it has to be cheap,surprise, but impactful.
Bring me a couple of your bestby sundown Friday.
I have done a little research.
You know, I work for the agency.
And I dont know I wantto keep a secret from Don.
You know Don. Tall guy, short temper.
For the purposes of this dinner,these are my ideas.
If it works out,Don will obviously pick you for it
and you can come upwith them all over again.
Yeah, but why?
Well, Michael,
when a man hates another manvery, very much,
sometimes he wants to knowthat something is his,
even if in the end he has to give it up.
You really do hate Campbell.
I dont devote the energyto hating people anymore.
Its for Mr. Cooper.
And whats for me? Its a lot of work.
My paying clients might suffer.
Jesus, I am bankrolling this entire outfit.
Say 100 now and 100 Monday morning.
You wipe your ass with 200 bucks.
Here, take it.
Ive got to start carrying less cash.
What are you doing?
Im sorry.
I cant eat fish five times a week.
Im sorry.
I dont want you to go to bed hungry.
I dont do it all the time.
Couldnt sleep.
You better take it out.
Sit down. This is nice.
Dont know that its nicethat Ive driven you to this
because I cant control myself.
Sweetheart, its got nothing to do with you.
- Well, what is it?- Nothing.
Ive just been putting it togetherthat this job is a dead end.
Does Lindsay want someoneelse for the campaign?
Lindsays not running.
He keeps saying that, but, you know...
Betty, Im the one who keeps saying it.
Turns out hes the one who means it.
He wants to wait until 72,but nows the time.
Once hes out,Rocky will get the nomination.
Rocky cant run. Hes divorced.
Nobody cares anymore.He just got re-elected governor.
I bet on the wrong horse, Betty.
I jumped ship for nothing.
This is a setback.
Youre always thinking about other people,
and then youre angrybecause no ones thinking about you.
But I am.
Its so easy to blameour problems on others,
but really were in charge of ourselves.
And Im here to help you,
as youre here to help me.
Well figure out whats next.
What time is it?
Midnight, I think.
Can I count it as tomorrow?
Okay.
Now.
Hello?
Hello.
What do you want?
I want to have dinner.
Is that a good idea?
You know what, Jane? When we took LSD,
you swore to me that you wouldalways be there for me.
Stop telling me things I said that night.
Like I know I didnt promiseto remarry right away
just to save you alimony.
No, this is true.And I have a very painless exercise,
which is taking some extremelyimportant clients to dinner
and having you on my arm.
Why dont you ask Joanie?Shes a professional something.
Because theyre dying to meet you.
Youd like them. Its a dinner.
Ill owe you.
I want you to buy me a new apartment.
Whats wrong with the one youre in?
Your mother is my landlord.
And honestly, it has a lot of memoriesand its painful to be here.
And I feel like I cant start a new lifeuntil I start a new life.
This is the most expensive dinner in history.
Really? Because I found the perfect one.
Well, youre lucky I called, then.
Fine.
Have your lawyer tell my lawyerwhat time dinner is.
I dont know,I feel like one of us should say thank you.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
You cant be here.
I missed you.
And I kept thinking about you.
I thought you were done with me.
I forgot you.
And then I saw youin the New York Times Sunday magazine.
Can I go watch TV?
Did you finish everything?
Yeah. You can check it.
Yeah? I just might do that.
My God, are you still working on the tree?
AII they care about is the names.
Well, I have questions.Do Megan and Henry get branches?
Of course. They get a branch off of usbecause were your parents.
What is this mess?
You carry this around with you every day?
This goes in your math folder.
This goes in your spelling.
Is this what youre doing in class?
No, I made it at Daddys.
Well, its very nice,
although I dont know why hes smiling.
"Lovely Megan,
"I went to buy a light bulb.
"When I get back, Ill see you better.
"Love, Don."
Everything looks good.
Ill take care of this. You can go.
You know what?Dont forget your Daddys first wife.
Youre right here.Elizabeth Hofstadt Francis.
No, your father had another wife before me.
He did?
Im surprised he didnt tell you that.
Megan helped me.
Just put it down. Its Anna Draper.
Shes deceased.
And turn it in already.I dont want another call from school.
Who is she?
I dont know why Megan didnt tell you.Ask her.
Okay.
Ive got an officejust across the ladies room
from the insurance company next door.
- At least youre over here.- Im the head of my department.
And Ive been working very hardand doing very well
and nothing has changed here.Its a lot of empty promises.
What were you promised?
Hello.
Its a mess in there.
Both campaigns draw you in,but in different ways. This ones a series.
If Harry rolls it out right,you wonder whos gonna get hit next.
Thats great.
And this one pulls you inas you hear the evil voice inside your head.
"This could change everything."
I think the devil is clever.
Snowballs chance in hell and so forth.
But I think the getting hit in the facehas a loud, juvenile quality
that makes a Sno Ball seemmore fun than a soft drink.
Also, they kept talking about refreshing,
and this one is literallya slap in the face.
The devil could be a series, too.
We could see what hes up toin different situations.
And its got the heatthat Warren talked about for thirst.
This ones funnier.
Lets lead with that one and take them both.
- Great.- Funny stuff. Really good work.
- Thank you.- Thank you.
Ive got drinks.
- Take these to full color.- Absolutely.
- What time is it?- Bye, creative.
"Look on my works,ye mighty, and despair."
You should readthe rest of that poem, you boob.
Come on. Here.
Bye-bye.
Sally?
Sally.
Bye.
Have fun.
Come on. Lets go.
Do you want me to make you something?You havent eaten.
I told you I dont want anything.
Why are you being so nasty today?
Because youre a phony.
You dont talk to me like that.
Who is Anna?
What?
You acted like you were friends with me.But you really do whatever he says.
And guess what?
Youre not special. And neither was Anna.
Where did you hear that?
You were my friend first.
Who told you about her?
Someone who doesnt lie.
Someone who didnt justpretend to care about my school project.
Sally, listen to me. I wasnt lying.
I just...I didnt think it was my place to say.
Everybody knows.
Youre a little girl. And its complicated.
Fine, just keep digging yourself deeper.
I dont know what your mother told you,
but your father and Annagot married to help each other.
They never lived togetherand they never had any babies. Honest.
So why did he marry her?
It was a long time ago.
And back then it was the only wayto help each other out.
So why did he marry you?
- Talk to your father.- I dont want to.
And dont tell him I asked. I mean it.
Are you going to make yourself cry?
I am your friend, you know.
Judy Steckler... May I?
Lost a full pound.
Good.
What a nice way to end things.
I dont know what happened.
No, its good.
Betty, you knowmaintaining is better than gaining.
It wasnt even a full week.
Now everyone deservesa round of applause.
You came on a Saturday.
This is the best thing you can do withthe challenge of Thanksgiving ahead.
And we know its not just the meal.
Its the cooking, right?
You have to taste everything.
Were supposed to be thankful for this,
but the food is justa symbol of all the other things.
We should fill ourselves with our children,
our homes, our husbands,
our health, our happiness.
So who has a plan forhow theyre gonna handle the day?
And the day before?
And lets not forget about leftovers.
Just wanted to make sure she was asleep.
Whats going on with her?
She asked me about Anna.Betty obviously told her.
- Are you kidding me?- No.
But I think I handledthe situation as best I could.
Who the hell told you to say anything?
What are you doing?
Damn it, this has nothing to do with you.
Keep your voice down.
Im not gonna let herkeep getting away with this crap.
Youre just gonna make it worse.
And let her keep stickingher fat nose in my business?
- Let it go.- Yeah,
and what am I supposed to say to Sally?
Nothing. I promised her I wouldnt tell you.
Jesus, whos the child here?
Get your hand off the phone.
You think this is an accident?
If you call her,youre giving her exactly what she wanted,
the thrill of havingpoisoned us from 50 miles away.
Im sorry.


I didnt know what else to do.
Im sorry about that.
I didnt think anybodyd still be here.
Im gonna leave in a minute.You come to steal something?
Nah, Im doing some work for Roger.
But Im not supposed to tell anybody.
Its a wine. Hes trying to reel them in.
Wants to look smart at the meeting.
And he asked you?
What can I say?I have gifts and Im grateful.
Just so you know, hes not going to payyou if you tell everybody.
He already did.
Maybe Ill throw some of ityour way if you tell me what you think.
I dont care.
Hello.
The article came outand were not mentioned.
What?
Its a bullshit pieceon the usual assholes.
He compares them to philosophers.
Hold on.
Page 52.
Hold on.
170 is the kicker.
Jesus, they look like Peter, Paul and Mary.
Why are they picking them?
I dont know and I dont care.
Maybe thats the problem.
You were the one whotalked to him for an hour.
I thought he was your best friend.You obviously made no impression.
- Hes a rat bastard.- You know what?
Dont wake me upand throw your failures in my face.
Its Sunday, for Christs sake.
Sally, get back here.Boys, back to your room.
Get over here.
Do you have something you want to ask me?
No.
You do, but you thoughtitd be better to ask Megan.
She wasnt supposed to say anything.
And what was she supposed to do exactly?
Not lie again.
Im sorry.
I know its my fault
that you even have to thinkabout things like this.
- Youre a little girl.- Im not a little girl.
Then you should realize that your motherdoesnt care about hurting you.
She just wants to hurt us.
- Are you done?- No.
Anna and I were married because of a law.
It wasnt romantic. She was a friend.
And I would have told you all about her,but she died.
Is she the woman whose housewe went to in California?
The one who called you Dick?
Yes.
And I really wish youd met her.
Now, you realize
an adult would apologize to Meganeven if telling her was an accident.
Okay.
Go hang up the phone in my room.
Anything for me in there?
Why dont you haveGinsberg get your lunch?
That Mohawk work I did for you was great.
And I kept it a secret,which is more than I can say for Ginsberg.
Its Manischewitz. He was perfect for it.
Im sick of hearing people think that way.
Im not an airplane either.I can write for anything.
You know, in the old buildings,they used to have an executive elevator.
You are not loyal.
You only think about yourself.
Were we married?Because youre thinking about yourself, too.
Thats the way it is.Its every man for himself.
Quaids department developed Sno Ball,and he will remind you.
Weve got Bob Dennison,who speaks for the local bottlers.
Well also have Michael Lloydand Warren Kent,
who deal with the local retailers.
- You want me to get those?- Im not taking two.
Sally?
Sally, get in here right now.
That was Mrs. Engel.
Apparently you got an A-pluson your family tree.
She thinks youre reallyturning things around.
Its just a drawing.
Im very proud of you.
You should thank Megan for her help.
She helped you, didnt she?
I guess so.
She just told me the same stuff you did.
Really? You asked her about Anna?
Yes. Daddy showed me picturesand they spoke very fondly of her.
I guess youve earned some TV.
So I pulled over tothe side of the interstate
and I let him out withhis luggage and everything.
He is not related to me.
Siegels a very common name.
You wouldnt want to think everyonenamed Rosenberg is related to you.
I didnt want to say it.
Lord knows theres beenplenty of prejudice in this country.
But growing up in Manhattan,Ive always envied the humor,
the closeness, the wayyour people keep track of each other.
So you married your way in, huh?
Ive always thought Jewish womenare the most beautiful women in the world.
Now thats a sales pitch.
Im sorry Im late.
This is my son, Bernard.
Were still on drinks.Roger Sterling, this is my wife Jane.
Bernie.
Nice to meet you.
Im sorry about that. I took the boat out.
- We got stuck.- Really? What kind of boat?
No, you two can discuss the details later.
My dad doesnt like yachtsbecause last time he was on one,
he rode steerage.
And look where you are now.
Ive been trying to find outwhat Roger thinks,
but he wanted to wait for you.
I wanted to wait for dessert,make sure you liked me.
Whats not to like?
As I understand it,youre trying to get Manischewitz
into the hands of different kinds of people.
So to us, it seemed the key was,different kinds of people.
If you ever look at the side of a bus,its a moving billboard.
The passengers cant see the ad,but everyone can see the passengers.
The idea was to put a picture of the busseats on the side of the bus
right below the windowwhere the real people are,
show the bottom halves of their bodies
with a case of Manischewitzunder each of their seats.
So it looks like whoevers riding the bushas bought the wine.
Isnt that clever?
So you thought that up, huh?
I engaged some of our creatives ad hocin anticipation of this dinner.
I figured even if you didnt like it,you could see what we were capable of.
I know its good.
Do we need menus?
I do.
Im getting the chateaubriandif someone will split it with me.
I thought you liked the crabs rangoon here.
I just had some.
So, Roger, what kind of boat do you have?
Am I the only onewho can work and drink at the same time?
- What happened?- They laughed,
they bought it and we already celebrated.
Im only here because Ive gotthree hours left on the coast.
- Hot damn!- I knew it.
Hold on. We work our ass offand we dont even warrant a call?
Blow by blow, please.
Don pitched the hell out of it,they said it was clever.
And apparently kidslike devils in cartoons, as I predicted.
Really? They didnt like the other one?
I dont know. He left it in the cab.
Are you kidding me?They never even heard it?
We made a sale. Anything else?
Im going to order some dinner.
Sure. Hes gonna be useless tonight.
So, you suddenlyhave no problem telling people Im Jewish?
You going to meet Bernie?
What? No.
So youre not gonna call him in two daysand tell him were separated?
You had your chanceto say who I sleep with.
Youre supposed to help me land this.
So if something goes onbetween the two of you,
youd better pretend youre still married.
I promise, bubala.
Im sorry.
The least you can do is show me whatthe better end of this deal looks like.
- What do you mean?- The apartment.
Show it to me.
When else am I gonna get a chance?
Im not moved in. I just got the key.
Has a lot of potential.
You think so?
I have missed you.
Roger, wait.
What?
Im surprised youre working today.
We roll out all our business this week.
Im just gonnaspend as much time as I can with my girl
before Im trapped with my familyover the holiday.
You know what, Howard?
Why dont you spend Thanksgiving with her,
and Ill go to your houseand screw your wife?
Are you kidding me?
Good luck with that.
But I guess the grassis always greener, right?
I know you saw me.
I thought you were hiding from someone.
That was a bold last-minute decision,going with your idea.
I thought it was more what they wanted.
Well never know, will we?
Because they never heard mine.
Look, I dont like going in with two ideas.Its weak.
And you dont wanna be weak,so you picked yours.
And they bought it,which is our goal, isnt it?
What do I care? I got a million of em.
- A million.- Good.
I guess Im lucky you work for me.
I feel bad for you.
I dont think about you at all.
- Good morning, Mr. Draper.- Morning.
I used the toothbrush in there.I hope its yours.
Why did you do that?
Jesus, it doesnt belong to the dead guy,does it? Its pink.
I told you why I wanted this apartmentand you ignored me.
I hardly ignored you.
Now this is no differentthan the last place.
Really? I think its nicer.
Not anymore.
You ruined this.
Shit.
You get everything you wantand you still had to do this.
Youre right.
I dont know why I did that.
I feel terrible.
Smells good.
I just got off the phone with Julia.
She got the part.
Good for her.
She asked me to buy champagne.
And you willbecause you want her to be happy.
Its hot as hell in here. Turn on the air.
Its on full blast. Go get ready.
Open the door at least.
No, dont.
The radio said theres a smog emergency.
The air is toxic. I dont want that in here.
That is a good-looking bird.
Mommy, wait. Were supposed tosay what were thankful for.
Shes hungry, Bobby.
No, I think its nice.
Go ahead, buddy.
Im thankful that I have two houses
and theyre both really bigand I got a new sled.
Im thankful that Im doing good in school.
Doing well.
I am thankful that I have everything I want.
And that no one else has anything better.
Me, too. Lets eat.
