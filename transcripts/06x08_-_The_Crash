Sylvia: Arnie, youshould eat something.
How about some leftover vealand some cold pasta?
Want a beer, honey?
Chicken salad or tuna?
Here come the judge.
Whats the difference?Eat it.
Who says we canthire more people?
Why dont you take a nap? Yourface looks like a bag of walnuts.
Everyone should take a rest.
Its an easy thingto say, isnt it?
Youre not thinking.Youre not writing.
Ted, calm down.You need a nap, too.
Can you believe this crap?
Yes, I can.
Sorry Im late.
Youre sorry youre late?
You couldnt call?
He called.I told you theres no news.
You did not make that clear.
You really didnt.You just said "no news."
You didnt say Kenny called in.
- Pow.- Damn it.
No one caresthat I almost got k*ll?
What did they say?
Its just like last time, no.
- What does that mean?- It means they didnt like it.
Then they got drunk, they tookme for a joyride in the Impala.
Why cant we have the Impala?
What did they say?
They said they didnt like em.
Its your job to makethem like them.
- Are you not up to the task?- Don.
What? Weve given them sevenways to go in six weeks.
We dont even getto talk to them?
We have to dependon this cripple?
You dont knowwhat hes up against.
Ive got to sit down,but Im not gonna
if youre just gonnacontinue to insult me.
Just sit down.
(sighs) They gave me this
and I cant evenshow it to you.
What is it?They typed up their rejection?
Its worse.
They finally gave mea calendar.
Three yearsof monthly deadlines.
Thats the restof 68, 69, and 70.
Best case scenario, six monthsof strategy statements,
every one of thembacked up with copy tests.
And then, if and whenthey land on something,
its got to kick its way upthe ladder through all of GM
until it gets to God.
And then Hes got torun it past His wife.
So what happens now?
You take a swing at itand they take a swing at me.
They want another packetTuesday morning.
- But they want me back on Sunday.- For what?
I guarantee youtheyre not going to church.
We cannot go on like this.
This is what Chevyis paying us for.
Its not our clock,its theirs.
So whats another weekend?
Because theyrereally paying us.
Mr. Chaough,you have a phone call.
Take a message.
Its Nan.Its about that matter.
Excuse me, Mr. Draper.
Get all the Chevy materialsback in my office.

But I wanted to tell youDr. Rosen is on the phone.
- Do you want me to take a message?- Yes.

Ill take it.
You know what, Don?Thats a great idea.
Im gonna call my doctor.Im gonna get Kenny here fixed up.

Arnold, how are you?
Its me.
(exhales) Um...
Im glad to hear that.
Oh, I bet you are,
because I wanted to let you knowthats what that would feel like.
I thought I misunderstood.
Oh, bullshit.
You have got to stoploitering in my hallway.
Sylvia, Im glad you called.
He saw all the cigarettebutts out there
and he thinksIm smoking again.
I want to see you.
I was in the kitchenbiting my nails
thinking,"I just cleaned it up."
How many nightsare you out there?
I know you want to see me, too.
All I kept thinkingis hes gonna come in
and ask my whytheres no lipstick on them
and Im gonna burst into tearsand tell him everything.
Then hes gonna m*rder meand m*rder you.
- Are you afraid of him?- No.
Im afraid of you.
I dont think you understand.
Look, Im too oldto say this was a mistake,
but I want you to tryand be happy.
About what?
That you got away with it.
When you startsomething like this,
it takes a lot of convincing.
Its all about whetheror not the other person
has as much to lose as you do,
because you want to be ableto trust them when its over.
And right now Im wonderinghow I ever trusted you.
I dont really havea choice, do I,
because youve got me.
So if you ever really caredabout me at all, knock it off.
Dont cry.Just listen to me.
Im feeling a lotof emotions, too.
Im hanging up.
Please, just listen.
I just want to talkto you about a few things.
You loved Megan once.

You girls should back away.
Does he have a fever?
You get your bedroll.
You stay in here,youll get everybody sick.
- You sleep in the cellar.- Yes, maam.
If the fever doesnt break,well call a doctor.
Better for youthan for everyone.
Aim√©e, did you leavethat plate in the lounge?
- (intercom buzzes)- Dawn: Mr. Draper?

Do you need some water?
No, Im fine.

Youre not a hired hand,youre their sister.
Boys, lets go.

The funeral will be tomorrow.
Franks family has askedthat in lieu of flowers

Frank Gleasonwas a great artist
and a great friend.
And he made our company whole.
Im not gonna be able to workwith you through the weekend.
I apologize, but Im afraidthis takes precedence.
Ill attend the funeralif thats all right.
But I can still make myselfavailable for Chevy.
Thats helpful.
Im sorry for your loss.
Hes a piecethat cannot be replaced.
The doctors hereand I want you to see him.
- I dont know.- No, hes gonna fix you up.
Thats an order.
Can I see him, too?I did it last time.
Were a team.If he does it, I do it.
Age before beauty.
How old was he?
Older than you,younger than me.
You either get used to itor stop thinking about it.
Sorry about your friend.
Yeah, its tragic.
I hope we dont loseTed for too long.
He doesnt know howto deal with these things.
Do you feel anything?Cause I dont.
He said it takes a minute.
- Well, maybe I need another.- Im next.
Actually, Roger, I thinkDon should go next. Don.
Pleasure to meet you.Dr. Hecht.
Don Draper.Where do you want me?
Anything in your medical historyyou want to alert me to?
No, Im just...

Youre exhausted.
Ill need you to turnaround and drop your pants.
- This goes in the gluteus.- What is it?
Its an energy serum.
Oh? Whats in it?
Its proprietary.But all you need to know
is its a complexvitamin superdose.
Its basically my own combinationof B vitamins and a mild stimulant.
You have a heart condition?
No. I thought you said it was mild.What does it do?
Well, a lot of things.But I think itll give you
what Jim Cutler says you need.
24 to 72 hours
of uninterrupted creativefocus, energy, and confidence.
- Really?- Really.
No one told you about this?
Ive visitedsome agencies lately.
- Youve got a great outfit here.- Thank you.
All anybody wants to know is whatare you gonna call this place?
Can you tug your drawersdown a little?
"SCDPCGC"?Thats a mouthful.

What do you say, Don?You think you can b*at me?
I want another chance.You changed course.
- Whos next?- Thatd be me.
- And I have a heart condition.- Dont worry about it.
(panting)
(laughs)
Come on, lets go.Best two out of three.
(echoing) You can b*at me any day.Let me see the doctor first.
Well do before and after.
(coughing)
(coughing)
Hey, kid.Where you going?
Come in here.
(coughing)
Sit down.
Breathe deep.
(inhales)
Is that you?
No.
Its a chest cold. Iveseen plenty of consumption.
You dont have it.
Lay down here.
Your mama dont knowhow to take care of nobody.
She aint my mother.
(coughs)
Can I help you?
Do we know each other?
Id like to think so.
Can I help you?
I meant from somewhereother than from this moment.
I dont think so.
(loud clicking)
- (men laughing)- (phones ringing)
(ringing, laughing increases)
(silent)
- Wheres Ed?- He said his heart stopped.
Roger took him to the hospital.
But they were both laughing.
The strategy is about somekind of love transaction
between a parent and a child
involving the greatestgift of all, a Chevy.
I was a child and she was a childin this kingdom by the sea.
Four score and seven years ago,
this country had somememorable happenings.
What I dont understand is
is it "Dad, I want this car"
or "Son, I boughtyou this car"?
Great, thats two. We need 15more and we can try another.
In what family is it "Son,I bought you this car"?
- Good night, all.- That guys family.
Did you hear aboutFrank Gleason?
(laughs) Yeah, I guessdreams do come true.
I think thats in poor taste.
Tell him, Peggy. Tell himwhat a son of a bitch he was.
I liked him.
Before he was sick?
I hate how dying makessaints out of people.
Well, hes obviouslyin a better place.
Have a good weekend.
"Dad, I need the car.Ive got a date."
"Dad, everybody at schoolhas a car but me."
"Dad, I can only goto college if I have a car."
- "Dad, I..."- "Dad, I could be dying in Vietnam.
Dont you want meto have a car?"
Damn it, Ginsberg.I had another 80 of them.
I got nothing interesting tosay cause Im not on drugs?
No, you just flusheda toilet in my head.
"Son, I got a carwhen I was your age."
"Son, they didnt havecars when I was your age."
"Son, you can fly till yourehigh as an elephants eye."
- (Stan chuckles)- Thats great.
What are you, class secretary?
I want to write stuff downso it looks like Im working.
Fine.
The child is the fatherof the man.
Spectacular.

Mr. Cosgrove is hereto see you.
Hello, Kenny.How you feeling?
My foots like new.
You think youll havenew work on Monday?
Ill have 15 campaignsfor you by then,
but you have to get me in a roomso I can look them in the eye.
The timbre of my voiceis as important as the content.
I dont know whetherIll be forceful or submissive,
but I must be therein the flesh.
You understand that I haveno power whatsoever?
Thats not true.Not if they like you.
- (feet tapping)- Oh, they like me all right.
(tapping)

Its my job to take them todinner at 80 miles an hour.
Its my job to stopa mile from the restaurant
so they can havefive pounds of crab legs
and three bottles of beer apieceand then go get prime rib.
Its my job to go hunting sothey can fire off their g*n

Whered you learn that?
My mother.No, my first girlfriend.
(tapping)
One doesnt like changingso often, you know?
- I dont know.- Im not myself, you see?
I dont see.
And she comesto the fork in the road
then she says to the CheshireCat, "Which road do I take?"
I know this.Where do you want to go?
- I dont know.- Then it doesnt matter, does it?
- Hows it going?- Whats going on?
I know youre all feelingthe darkness here today.
But theres no reasonto give in.
No matter what youve heard, thisprocess will not take years.
In my heart I knowwe cannot be defeated
because there is an answerthat will open the door.
There is a wayaround this system.
This is a test of our patience
and commitment.
One great ideacan win someone over.
Dear Lord, youre asgood as they say.
That was very inspiring.
Do you have any ideawhat the idea is?
No.
But Im not gonna stop looking.

You can just think of it.You dont have to say it out loud.

No, hes talkingabout some account.
He asked me yesterday.I dont think it exists.

Ive got 666 ideas.
Im wasting my Saturdaywith lunatics.
- Its Saturday?- Yes, it is.
Why dont you lay downfor a little while?
Because Ive got it. I wantyou to go to the archives.

You see the mess you made?
Wendy:That was fast.
What are you doing in here?
You said you weregoing to get some ice

"This may be hard to believe,

The history should notbe ignored.
Look, I dont want to wasteyour time, with..."

Just let me say a few things.
You and I both know..."
Did you want us?
Yes.Get everyone.
No, wait.
Just listen.Ive got it.
Great.
Remember this work?
Ive never seen it before.
Well, it says it all.It really does.
Okay, Ive gotthis great message
and it has to do with whatholds people together.
What is that thingthat draws them?
Its a history.
And it may not even bewith that person, but its...
its like a...
well, its bigger than that.
And that makes them buy a car?
If this strategy is successful,its way bigger than a car.
Its everything.
I keep thinking about the basicprinciple of advertising.
Theres entertainmentand you stick the ad
in the middle of the entertainmentlike a little respite.
Its a bargain.
Theyre gettingthe entertainment for free.
All they have to dois listen to the message.
But what if they donttake the bargain at all?
What if theyre suddenlybored of the entertainment?
What if they dont...what if they turn off the TV?
- You gotta get your foot in the door.- Exactly!
So, how do I do that?
Lets say I get herface to face.
How do I captureher imagination?
I have a sentence, maybe two.
Whos "her"?
Promise them everything. You know,youre gonna change their life.
- Youre gonna take away their pain.- Thats good.
Then you hit emwith the one-two punch.
Whats the answerto all of lifes problems?
A Chevy.
No, its not.
Then its oatmeal?
No.
What have you been doingthe last three days?
Have you been workingon Chevy at all?

Oh, thank God youre here.
Whats going on?
Ill tell you whats going on.
Some elderly n*gro womanheld your children hostage
and robbed you blind.
- What?- Betty.
She robbed a bunchof places in the building
and she came in here.
Our back door was open.
She said she was your mother.
We think we caught herboarding the IRT.
Youll need to come downin the next 24 hours
and ID your things.
Because no one was here.
Because shes off on thecasting couch and youre...
what does he tell everybody,that hes at work?
This is not the time or theplace for this conversation.
Maam, this could havehappened to anyone.
Anyone who livesin this disgusting city
and leaves theirthree children alone.
Do you know Henrysrunning for office?
Sally, Im really sorry.
I should have beenhome earlier.
I want to go home.
(sighs)
Miss Swenson: You get your hands off me!I dont need to be manhandled!
Mack: I know youvebeen holding out on me.
You dont know anything.I defy your accusations.
You peddle that asson the street.
You dont deserve a home.You dont deserve me.
Yeah? I do finewithout you.

Youre trash!
You are filth!
You know that you are!
After I gave you a home,

I know youre exhausted, but I couldfeel the floor swimming, too,
when I came home to that.
Im surprisedwe didnt all faint.
(sighs)
Im really sorry.
Sally seems so grown up,but shes really still a kid.
(doors close)

You should talk to him.
Hello?

Im... Im so embarrassed.
I acted likea stupid little kid.
No, you didnt.
And Im sure shes fooledplenty of adults, too.
She said she knew you.
I asked her everything I know
and she had an answerfor everything.
Then I realized I dont knowanything about you.
- (intercom buzzes)- Dawn: Mr. Chaough wants to see you.
You did everything right.
Try and forget about it.
Okay.
- Bye.- Sally.
I left the door open.
It was my fault.
Okay. Bye.

Morning, fellas.
Im fine.Thank you for asking.
How could you bringFranks little girl here?
I let her tag along.
I kept an eye on her,didnt I, Don?
Who?
Wendy.
Believe me, its a lot betterthan what could have happened
if I had let her loose in theVillage like she wanted.
Well, thats notwhat her mother thinks.
What the hell went onhere this weekend?
Half of this work is gibberish.
"Chevy" is spelled wrong.
Look, I am goingto continue on Chevy
in my functionas creative director.
That is, evaluatingother peoples work.
Thats all I can do right now.
Call me around 1970
when theyre readyto make an ad.
What are you talking about?I cant do this by myself.
Im sorry, Ted.
But every time we get a car,
this place turnsinto a whorehouse.
