Kids, time to go!
Coming, Carla.
And I said I liked her name.
Cocoas a nice name. Isnt it?
Yes. It is.
Come on, Bobby. Lets go.
All right. Lets go.
Good morning.
- Peggy.- Good morning, Don.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Hollis.
You hear about Marilyn? Poor thing.
Its very upsetting.
I cant say Im surprised.
The few things I know about her.
You just dont imagine herever being alone.
She was so famous.
Some people just hide in plain sight.
My mother and sister keep calling.
su1c1de is disturbing.
I keep thinking about Joe DiMaggio.
Were lucky Playtex didnt gofor that Jackie/Marilyn campaign.
Wed have to pull everything indefinitely.
Yes, thats true.
Ive never taken pills,even when I had a headache.
Mr. Draper, good morning.
Would you like coffee?
I already had some.
Theyre waiting for youin the conference room.
Do you need to go home?
No. Of course not.
I have Warren, and I have Todd.
Todd is a mail boy.Why do you have him?
Im paying him.
Im sorry.I dont understand this stupid bl*od drive.
You just hate that Media wins every year.
Wins what? How do you win a bl*od drive?What do you win?
I dont know.Youre the best or something.
Ill be lucky if Accountscan get eight people.
Well, Campbells afraid of needles,
Duck doesnt give two craps.
Good morning.
Good morning, fellas.
Is this program already in progress?
Were expecting our mostsuccessful bl*od drive ever.
Yes. Tell me everything.
I think were very organized.
Creative, our department,
will be at 75 to 80% participation.
Of course, Im assuming you are in.
I am.
Do Kurt and Smitty count as one person?
Why dont you bore me with the details?
Were gonna take the lockersout of the break room,
put em in the hallway in the morning.
There will be two litters, three nurses,
at least one old lady serving refreshments,and pIenty of chairs.
Kinsey, I want you to pullevery intern and Iackey--
switchboard, elevator men.
Find out who wants to bea copywriter for the day.
DoIlar a head.
Thats not fair.
Youre in Accounts.You should have thought of it.
Just to be clear,
do I get the dollar for each person I get,
or do they get it for giving bl*od?
The people giving bl*od.
This is for mankind, Kinsey.
Thats the money theyd makeactually being in the art department.
So what is the prize?
Helping another human being.
Also, there will be women fainting.
Id think youd like that.
If this was a flat-out athletic competition,
Accounts would win,without a doubt.
What an elegant surrender.
And put up more posters.
I cant believe I have to say thatto you people.
Apparently, if we get 1 00% participation,
which Media will do its best to aid,
theyre going to put us in the Times.
I booked a photographer, just in case.
Good.
NBCs having the Mitch Millerconcert on Thursday.
Any chance I could showyou and Mrs. Draper off?
Wed love to, but--
. . .my kid is sick.
Youll know what that means soon enough.
sh*t down.
That was quick.
What do we have today?
The 1 0:00 with Miss Hollowayto go over traffic for new business,
4:00 with Ron Venincasafrom Ace Hardware,
and Mr. Sterling moved the meetingwith Boston Edison to 5.
I assume to have it bleedinto the cocktail hour.
May I?
There was a bit of confusion last night.
I think I made a terrible mistake.
What happened?
Your daughter called and asked
when you would be backfrom your business trip
because her mother wasnt sure.
You dont have to tell me anything,but I didnt know what to say.
I said Wednesday.I know I should have said I dont know.
Mrs. Draper is working out some things.
I understand.
Im sure it wont come up again.
I thought it would be over by now,
I guess, and thered be no need to--
Im sorry about that.
It goes without saying that this is personal,
and Id appreciate your keeping it that way.
Of course.
Id also avoid giving me concerned looks.
Mr. Draper, I hope youve noticedIm a discreet person.
I dont know you at all,
and this is personal,
and its not up for discussion.
Of course.
If you need anything,Im right out there.
Im at the Rooseveltif theres an emergency.
In an interview just weeks before her death,
Miss Monroe angrily protested to a reporter
about attacks on stars.
"Were whats okay withthe movie business," she said.
"Management is whatswrong with the business."
Mr. Campbell, Miss Olson,and Mr. Romano are here.
Send them in.
My oldest just turned 30,
and shes had a string of bad beaux.
Its very upsetting.
Can I get you kids anything?
- Im fine.- Ill have something.
Theyre probably walking over.
Dress rehearsal, Freddie.
Ill do introductions.
Jeff Hartungs wife just had a baby.
Boy or girl?
Thats good.
Then I talk about Volkswagen.
No. Don said we onlybring up Volkswagen
if they dont like what weve presented.
Okay. Then I throw it to you, Freddie.
Thank you, Freddie.
"I just got a brand-newSamsonite Silhouette,
"and I hate it.
"Dont get me wrong.
"I love the shape, the size, the color,
"and I love the Silhouettebecause its a Samsonite,
so I know were gonna golots of places together,"
see lots of things,
collect a lifetime of memories.
I hate my Silhouette because its empty.
Then Sal.
Shouldnt the artwork come first?
What about unveiIing it?
You know how excited they get.
Freddie?
What the hell, Freddie?
What--
What were we talking about?
Two types of travelers.
Freddie, do you haveanother pair of trousers here?
Why?
Jesus.
Ill fix this.
Im gonna-- I need a minute.
I gotta think.
Freddie?
Is he dead?
No, hes not dead. He passed out.
Hes fine.
The Hartungs are at reception.
Well be right there. Thanks, Abigail.
He cant leave this room.
Theyre all from Colorado.
I guess I could push it until tomorrow,
book them another night at the Carlyle.
Should I just cancel it?
I should talk to Don.
Thats not necessary.I can handle this.
Fine.
Jesus. Its a suitcase.
Peggy, you can do it, right?
You think its gonna be better tomorrow?
Shit.
Itll be fine.
Well tell them Freddies sick. Its true.
Ill go to reception.You two go to the conference room
and act like youve been waiting,but dont look mad.
Someone telI Freddies girl its cancelled.
I dont want him wandering in.
Its disgusting.
Theres no need for that.
Can I speak to you for a minute?
Carla?
I forgot you were coming by.
Are you okay?
I havent been feeling weIl.
Oh, no, Betty.
You and Don are stillcoming tonight, l hope.
Wed love to.
I just dont think IIl be up to it.
That ruins things.
Well, you wanted to borrowthe black chiffon, right?
Come upstairs.
Are you sure?
I dont know who Im gonna talk to.
Raymond has to work these things.
And I got you out of bed?I am so sorry.
Give me the black one, and Ill go.
Nonsense.
I think my waist is higher than yours.
What do you have thats generous?
I dont know.
How about this?
Youll look like sherbet.Long white gloves.
I cant wear those after Gypsy.
Think youll be betterby lunch on Thursday?
Im looking forward to it.
This is youthful.
It doesnt matter. Im invisible.
Thats not true.
Raymonds sweet about it,but hes so easy to please.
Thats sweet.
It is.
I think, what did I do to deserve him?
Then I spend his money on Dr. Weinberg.
I got my diagnosis the other day.
Im bored .
Thats too bad.
I saw Arthur have a fight with Tara,
and I have been havingridiculous dreams since.
I wish youd come ride with us again.
It reaIly takes the pressure off.
Think you can carry this?
No, maam.
You shouldnt talk to him so much.
I know. Its embarrassing.
Its a switch you can flipon and off, you know.
Really?
You dont even think about this, do you?
Dons perfect.
Can we talk at lunch?
Im really not feeling well.
Take them all.
No. Just these two.
Thats it for today.
Manys the time Ive dreamedof finding you like this.
What are you doing here?
Youre right.
Ill just get all my beIongings,
- and IlI leave.- Its 4:30.
Youre supposed to besitting in a bar somewhere
waiting for Boston Edison.
How often do you come in here?
Not that often.
Whats wrong, Red?
Do you miss me?
She was so young.
Not you, too.
Yes, Im just another frivolous secretary.
Its a terrible tragedy,
but that womans a stranger.
Roosevelt--
I hated him, but I felt like I knew him.
A lot of peopIe felt like they knew her.
You should be sensitive to that.
Hey. Youre not like her.
Physically, a little,
but dont tell me that makes you sad.
Its not a joke.
This worId destroyed her.
ReaIly? She was a movie starwho had everything and everybody,
and she threw it away.
But, hey, if you want to be sad.
One day youll lose someonewhos important to you.
Youll see.
Its very painful.
Are you feeling better, Mommy?
Yes. Ill join you next time.
Im surprised Daddy let you in the car.
You kids should go to bed .
Wash your face and brush your teeth.Ill tuck you in.
Good night.
You just came back.
Now youre leaving again?
Itll go by like that.
Come here.
It wont be that long, Salamander.
Go.
Listen, she called my office.
She did? When?
Monday.
What do you want me to say?
I think she expected youover the weekend.
You said you didnt want me here,and then you do.
I didnt want them involved in this.
Obviously, thats impossible.
What do you want to do?
I mean, how Iong is this going to go on?
We have to tell them something.
Like what?
Okay. How about. . .
Im working on an account.
Theyre putting me up in Philadelphia,
but IlI be home every weekend.
Jesus. Did you just think that up?
Or I could just come home.
Bets, what do you want?
Listen, if your minds made up,
Im not gonna taIk you into it.
I thought you can talkanyone into anything.
Good night.
Would you like coffee?
And a bear claw.
Whats this?
I thought you could usea few more shirts in your rotation.
Thank you. Submit your receipt.
Your correspondence is on your desk.
Let me get you breakfast.IlI be right back.
And Mr. Kinsey saidthat l have to drag you,
if necessary, to the bl*od drive.
Youre not a fainter, are you?
I dont faint, but I might cry after.
Peggy.
Hello, Freddie.
Howd it go yesterday?
I Ieft word with Abigail. They loved it.
Good. Good.
I was thinking aboutletting you talk anyway.
I have to apologizefor putting you in that spot.
Freddie, its over.
Theres no reason to talk about it.
Of course.
Did they ask about me?
We told them you were sick.
Thats good.
So on Monday,when they get back to Colorado,
Ill give them a caIl and sew things up.
Thats a great idea.
Bobby.
Mrs. Draper. Im sorry to bother you.
Its okay, Carla.
Its a beautiful day.
Im going to take the children out again.ls that good?
Whatever they want.
Can I do anything for you?
If you want, I can draw a bath.
No, thank you.
Ive been marriedalmost 20 years, you know.
I really dont want to talk about this.
Im sorry.
Carla. . . .
I havent been sleeping very well.
You know what helps?
Splash cold wateron your face and go outside.
YoulI notice thingsare right where you left them.
Im usually part of the meetingbefore the meeting.
Relax, Don. Sit down.
This is all being done in the right way.
Campbell.
Well, Don, Im afraidwe have some bad news.
We were on the launch padyesterday for Samsonite,
and Freddie Rumsen pissed his pants.
What?
Hes not talking about nerves here.
Hes taIking about a wet pair of pants.
Really?
Howd the presentation go?
Don, its conduct unbefitting.
Of Freddie Rumsen?
Were lucky Campbell heregrabbed the controls.
He locked Rumsen upand threw Peggy OIson in.
Were lucky the bench is deep.
We have to cut him loose.
Is that necessary?
The man is a train wreck.
We at least need to get himoff this account.
They called already.Theyre thrilled with Peggy.
No. I dont want himon any of my accounts.
This could have happened in a meeting.
But it didnt.
Thatll be all, boys.
Thank you for bringing thisto our attention.
Were not doing him any favorskeeping him around.
Ducks a teetotaler.
Hes been g*nfor Freddie since day 1 .
Hes got a point.
We cant even tell Cooper about this.
You know his whole thing with germs.
I dont think its in my contract
that Duck can fire someonein my department.
You dont have a contract.
And I can fire anyone I want to.
We really dont have a choice.
You can still get him to give bl*od.
The agencies will laugh about this,
but the clients,they already think were all like that.
Well say its a six-month leave of absenceso he can go for the cure.
Hell know what that means.
You dont want to throw him away.
Your loyalty is startingto become a Iiability.
Lets do this before he finds out.
We dont need any more accidents.
Dinner tonight.
You need to call the missus?
Ill make it.
Mr. Case.
Betty.
How are you?
Its a beautiful day.
Have you just ridden,or are you about to ride?
I can never tell whetheryoure before or after.
Im on my way out.
Its good to see you.
How are your children?
Theyre wonderful.
Have you seen Sara Beth lately?
I think so. Monday, maybe?
Thats good news.
Im glad she came.
Why?
Nothing.
I had noticed she seemed distracted.
I shouldnt have said anything.
Is there anything I can do?
No. But shed be gladto know youre concerned.
I think you make her feel better.
She talks about you a lot.
I didnt mean to embarrass you.
You know what?
The three of us should go to lunchand have some fun.
It would cheer her up.
Its a great idea.
Thursday?
Café Soleil in Old Town.
1 :00.
Ill pick up the check.
See you then.
That was nothing.
Im thinking of doing it again.
You should smoke a cigarette right now.
I know they said not to,
but Im telling you,my knees buckled.
I thought I was gonna performa full Freddie Rumsen.
Jesus.
Hello, Don. Were in the lead.
Turns out Hollis has a novel.
Good.
Too bad Freddie madehis donation yesterday.
Hes a real wizz in advertising.
Jesus.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Thats none of your business.
Freddie had a bad day.
Cant you find something else to do
besides dining on the dramaof other peoples lives
like a bunch of teenage girls?
Sorry, Don. Its funny.
Sure.
Its just a mans name, right?
Could you leave us alone for a moment?
Truth to tell, I was a little nervous.
Id never given one of thosefunny speeches before
where you say what you dont mean.
Freddie, weve reached a decision.
Youre gonna takea six-month leave of absence.
Is that necessary?
The door wiIl be open.
It was a snafu.
Isnt the embarrassment enough?
Full salary. You dry out, come back,
well see where we are.
Clients love me. I keep up with them.
We have laughs.
Monday morning, Ill be good as new.
I promise.
Theres a line, Freddie,
and you wet it.
You see? Were laughing about it.
Whats the big deal?
You remember Bob Peebles?How mean he was?
He fired his secretary,
and he threw all her thingsout the window,
including her keys.
That was good for morale.
What is this about?
Duck PhiIlips?
Hes as dry as a bone.
He doesnt understand this business.
Freddie, my father wouldhave fired you for this.
Your father drank morethan the two of you put together.
He used to come inwith his shirt on inside-out.
He admired you.
I , however, had differentfeelings at the time.
When we first met,
Bonny Prince Sterling herethought I was a coward
because I was in the Signal Corps.
I didnt know it was onlyfor his last six months.
I thought he was a typist.
Turns out before that,
he was in charge of k*ll people--
and by people, I mean Germans.
It was a long time ago.
Come on. Be proud.
What was it? Like 1 5 of them.
Thats impressive.
Look, l can be completely in control.
My podiatrist went to Hazleton.
Came back a new man with great stories.
Only drinks beer now.
Its the best thing, Freddie.
Well, I guess you get dealtthe hand you get dealt, right?
I can pull myself together.


I got a great book.
Maybe lll head to PhilIy or Boston.
Theyre all dying to do what we do here.
You know lll recommend you.
Fantastic. So this couId be good.
Theres a lot of great towns.
My father sold greeting cards.
He used to come into the kitchen,
unroll this map on the table,
and put a finger on a spotand say something like,
"Memphis. Who wantsto live in Memphis?"
Id say, "Not me."
We had only been in Springfieldfor nine months.
Meanwhile, here we are.
To New York.
Come on. Lets make a night of it.
Really?
AbsoluteIy.
To Monday morning.
Itll be here faster than you think.
Hold off on the menus.
Were going to take another lap first.
Bring some bread.
Give me 5 bucks.
No. Sorry. Don.
Can I help you gentlemen?
Swordfish.
And who are you here to see?
You cant do that now.
I just gave you the money.
Come on. Do we look like cops?
Sir?
I have a very good friend--
I cant remember the guys name.
How about if I give you our names?
Im Dick Dollars,
this is Mike Moneybags,
and this--
Tilden Katz.
Fine.
Here.
Thats a 20.
Gentlemen.
Is it Milwaukee?
Yes, it is.
Son of a bitch.
The Chuck-a-luck.
Going to need some cocktails.
Hey, isnt that the champ back there?
For another couple of months.
Youre crazy.
Nobodys gonna b*at him.
Hey, loosen up.
Everythings gonna be okay.
Just in time.
Canadian Club neat,Wolfschmidt Gibson,
Granddad rocks.
Pete Campbell.
I would have never thoughtI was in his way.
You know, you bet badly.
Obviously.
No. I mean you win a few times,
you got to start really putting it out there.
You kept betting the same thing.
Youre so good at this,why dont you quit your job?
See? Hes having a great time.
Hello, there.
Are we winners or losers?
Losers tonight,but winners in general.
You know, BBDO hired a colored kid.
What do you think of that?
I think Im glad Im not that kid.
Im sorry.Can we get you a drink or something?
No.
Im sorry. Were you interested?
No, Im fine. Thank you.
I know whats going on.
You come in too early.
You got dry cleaningmoving in and out.
I cant remember the Iast time it was
you went out spur of the moment.
Send off Freddie,I had to send off Freddie.
Come on.
Ive been in your particular situation.
I heard you chaired the bl*od drive.
Where are you, the Stanhope?
The Biltmore?
- Roger.- Did she kick you out? You leave?
Theres nothing to talk about.
Look, people make mistakes.
You feel bad about it.You think things over,
and in the end,you do the grand gesture for her.
Itll be easy for you . Youre creative.
Roger, will you stop?
All Im gonna say isdo you want to be right,
or do you want to be married?
I know marriage isnt a natural state,but you do it.
Why?
I dont know.
The kids.
Again!
And dont fool yourself.There are other things.
Think about when you met her.
Okay. Im sorry.
Youre so secretive.
Hey, Don.
Look whos here.
If it isnt the manin the gray flannel suit.
What the hell was that for?
Were gonna go.
Dont worry about it.
Im sure its not the first timehes been punched in the face.
Hey, Floyd.
Howd I do?
Im sure there are 20 peoplewho want to thank you for that.
It wasnt exactly a fair match-up.
I think thats gonna do it for me.
Yeah. Me, too.
Its getting late.
- This was a nice evening.- Hold on.
Don and I are going to the East Side.You take it.
AbsoluteIy.
ld like to stay and getall sentimental with you,
but l got to go and givea Chinaman a music lesson.
Want to watch how I do it,unzipping the fly and everything?
Yeah. Go to heIl.
Take him to McCann.
This was fun.
Good.
Im gonna miss you.
Youre talented.
I dont know.
Thank you, Freddie.
It means a lot.
What am l gonna do?
What am l going to tell Violet?
I dont know.It sounded like you had a plan.
Im not kidding, Don.
What am l gonna do?
Its not an ending.
Its a fresh start.
If I dont go into that office every day,
who am I?
Where do you live, Freddie?
1 52 Riverside Drive.
Apartment 604.
No matter what he says,take him there.
Good night, Freddie.
Good-bye, Don.
See, I find if I stickwith the clear liquors--
vodka, gin-- I know where I stand.
Im the opposite.
So what do you think,because you gave bl*od,
the whiskey made you a little angry?
That was a realArchibald Whitman maneuver.
Whos that?
This hothead drunk I used to know.
Jimmy Barretts a weaseI. Enjoy.
So whats going on with you?
Im at the Roosevelt.
See? That wasnt so hard.
I really dont want to discuss it, Roger.
Why? Because you feel so bad?lve been there.
No, I dont feel bad at all.
I mean, sometimes.
Mostly, Im just relieved.
Really?
Did you falI in love?
No.
Thatd be easier.
Then Id know what to do.
Easier--
Theres some incredible woman,
and someones gonna end up with her,but it cant be you.
Why not?
Cause were married.
I dont know.
Its your life.
You dont know how long its gonna be,
but you know its got a bad ending.
You have to move forward.
As soon as you canfigure out what that is.
Two coronaries.
Gotta move forward.
Its your life.
I mean, this cant be it, right?
Were in it together.
Thats true.
You wanted to see me?
Close the door.
That was quite a presentation you gave.
The Samsonite people are thrilled.
Thats good to hear.
Theyve requested that you be reassignedas the copywriter on their account.
What about Freddie?
Freddies decidedto take a few months off.
He did? Whens he coming back?
It doesnt matter.
Youll be taking over all of his business.
Are you sure?
You know, I really dont like
walking into an ambushfrom Duck and Pete Campbell.
I dont know why anyonehad to know about that.
Even me?
No, of course you,
but. . .
I just thought that--
I Iove Freddie.
Whats your point?
Dont feel bad aboutbeing good at your job.
I wish it hadnt happened this way.
Thats the way it happened.
Congratulations.
- Miss Olson--- In a minute.
You couldnt keep your mouth shut.
Mr. Campbell.
Do you know what you didto Freddie Rumsen?
For just cause.
You didnt have to tell Don.
You told on Mr. Rumsen?
Do you mind?
It would have gotten out anyway.
Right, and hed be some legendin one of those stupid stories.
Remember the guy who wet his pantsbefore the big meeting?
Instead, hes finished.
Why do you feel bad for him?
Those people always blametheir problems on society.
He did it to himself.Those people have no self-control.
lf it wasnt for him,Id stilI be a secretary.
If it wasnt for me,youd still be a junior copywriter.
I refuse to feel bad .Were going to get raises.
You could get his office.
Now, Ill go first.
Congratulations, Peggy.
Congratulations, Pete.
Good to see you.
This is me.
Its nice to see you.
What are you doing here?
Betty invited me for lunch,
but were gonna needanother place setting.
Were gonna be three.
Betty didnt say youd be joining us.
I hope Im not intruding.
She thought itd be fun.
It will be.
Its just gotten infinitely more fun.
I think I need whatever youre having.
Its a gin and tonic.
Nothing speciaI.
Its perfect.
Keep stirring.
Bobby, go get two spoons.
So with Indian Point open now,
we should be able to useeven a modest safety record.
We were spitballing about a cartoon turtle.
Kids. Keeps it friendly and nature-loving,
and then we just hammerthe Ravenswood area
until theyre ready for the next plant.
You on board with that?
Yes.
I want to see schedules,
and I want to see this turtle.
He doesnt want to be disturbed.
Hello, Don.
Hello, Mona. Jane, its okay.
Just stop.
What?
I dont even know what to say to you.
About what?
Dont act innocent.
Hes leaving me for his secretary.
Roger?
Hes in love,and you said it was great.
Mona, I didnt say anything.
"Its your life.You have to move forward."
Mona, I didnt mean it that way.
25 years of marriage.
I want you to calm down.
Dont make me make a scene.
We should talk about this.
You can talk to Margaret.
Listen, Don, I can explain.
I want her off my desk.
