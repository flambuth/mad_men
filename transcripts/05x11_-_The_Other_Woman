Jaguar, the mistresswholl do things your wife wont.
What did I say before?
The client doesnt want tohear the word "mistress."
Salesmen can use it, but the campaign cant.
Jaguar, youll love it when youre in it.
Are we just spitting up lines now?
You know what? Lets take a break.
Where are you going?
What was unclear about the factthat hes taking a break and were not?
I need you to sign off on Secor Laxative.
I told you you were in charge of allongoing business till Jaguars done.
- Just handle it.- Done.
- Hows the prospect doing?- Is it lunchtime?
Jesus, is it?
Mr. Sterling bought lobster from The Palm.
Doesnt that sound good?
Hey.
So, I dont knowwhat the Jaguar executives will say.
But I got dealerships in Montclair,
Englewood, Morristown,Paramus and Rutherford.
And I carry three other foreign cars.
So, frankly, creativehas to be pretty spectacular
or Jaguar is just another word on the sign.
Well, then we have nothing to worry about.
The dealership on the ground floorof the corporate offices on Madison
has done very welljust having that XK-E in the entrance.
You have to be excited about this car.
Oh, its a red-hot number.Im excited about that.
But Im a hard man to please.
I always feel like someoneshould go the extra mile.
Were open to anything your heart desires.
Well, the other daywhen we were all touring your offices,
our guide was a dynamite redhead.
- Joan Harris.- Built like a B-52.
Yeah, we know who youre talking about.
Well, I sure would like the opportunityto get to know her better.
Well, a lot of guys would.But, you know, shes...
Shes a very interesting girl.
Shes one of these free spirits?You know, open to ideas?
So you like redheads? I think I know some.
I like that redhead.
And I think she and I
would both welcome the opportunityto spend a night together.
Well, you could ask her out.It wouldnt be a conflict.
No, Im kind of shy.
All Im saying is, if it happens,it would make me happy.
If it doesnt, well,no guarantees in life, right?
- Get another round. Ill get it.- Absolutely not.
- Was that what I think it was?- Yes, it was.
Why didnt you just let metell him she was married?
Because so is he.And he already knows that.
Well, we wanted to be in the car business.
- You waited up.- No.
I mean, yes.
Im going in to read tomorrowfor a really good part.
An audition? Why didnt you call?
Honestly, because I had to goto 1 Oth Avenue to get the script
and then I went and talked to Fanny,
you know, who teachesmy auditioning class.
Youre very good at auditions.
Not as good as the girls who get parts.
You know what? Lets talk about your day.
Well, I was gonna watch Carsonand cry myself to sleep.
Itll come to you. It always does.
Unless it comes to you.
Do you really want helpor you want to yell at me?
I dont know yet.
Whats the strategy?
A Jaguar is beautiful, but unreliable.
It comes with a tool kitthe size of a typewriter.
You basically have toown another car to go places.
So were saying its your gorgeous mistress.
So a wife is like a Buick in the garage.
Were trying to make a weaknessinto a strength.
- Were selling to men.- No, I got it.
Doesnt being a mistressmake the car immoral?
The word "mistress" wont be in the ad.
I dont know, but it sounds great.
I need to learn some of this.
There goes the act.
One sh*t, and there goes the tambourine.
Youre here early.
What can I do for you?
Nothing.
Nothing, its just,I got some bad news last night
and I was hoping youd help me deliver it.
What happened?
Well, we were having dinnerwith Herb Rennet.
I think you met himthe other day, from Jaguar.
- Handsome guy.- I dont remember any of them.
Well, I dont know what to do.
He basically pledgedhe wasnt going to back us.
Why not?
Turns out he wanted somethingwere not prepared to give.
Something very unorthodox.
- Good morning.- Yes?
Im here. Im going to get danish.
What does he want?
I feel like I shouldnt even bring this up.
In fact, I dont know how to bring this up.
But were going to lose Jaguar unless
an arrangement is made, and it involves you
and, well, Herb.
How did that come up?
He said he was crazy about youand then he just asked.
And then I thought we were past it,but right before we put him in a cab,
he said it againand it was quite conditional.
A night with you or no vote.
Well, Im sorry to hear that.
Anyway, if you can think of some wayto break the news to the company
that were out of this,Id really appreciate it.
Youre unbelievable.
Im married.
How would you feelif someone asked Trudy?
I didnt bring this up. He did.
If youre not interested in the idea at all,I appreciate...
Its just...
It seems to me that theres somethingthat could be worth the sacrifice.
Were talking about a night in your life.
Weve all had nights in our liveswhere weve made mistakes for free.
Youre talking about prostitution.
Im talking about businessat a very high level.
Do you consider Cleopatra a prostitute?
Where do you get this stuff?
She was a queen.
What would it take to make you a queen?
I dont think you could afford it.
This was an act of desperation.
I hope I havent insulted you.
Thats all that matters to me.
I understand.
Scarlett, were ready.
Now, we cant get Ginsberg out for the call,so we want you to pretend youre his junior.
- Partner?- Supervisor.
I have Mr. Rick Swansonfrom Chevalier Blanc cologne on speaker.
Hi, Rick. Its Kenny.
Im here on a speakerwith Harry Crane and Peggy Olson,
Mr. Ginsbergs supervisor,
and we want to knowwhy you want to pull the ad.
- Hello, everyone.- Hi, Rick.
Hello.
Were very happy with the work,
but sales have leveled offsince the holidays.
Its Harry. And, you know,Valentines Day is coming up.
A girl cant get a guy flowers.
Why would a woman buy a mananything for Valentines Day?
Rick, its Peggy.
I think youre right.
The target of "A hard days night" was men,but we can easily change that.
How do you do that?
Hello?
What if its our leatherjacket hero
running down the streetbeing chased by screaming girls
and instead ofjumping into a bar,he comes upon Lady Godiva on a horse
as naked as we are allowed to make her?
And he stops short, but she leans downand picks him up and puts him on the horse
and rides away with him.
Whats the tagline?
Its something about how, you know,
the right woman loves Chevalier Blanc.
So its exactly the sameexcept for the ending?
And maybe Paris instead of London.
Ooh-la-la. A French song.
Close the door, please.
Herb Rennet has demandedto spend a night with Joan.
And I dont mean dinner and dancing.
He just came right out and said that?
Who is he?
Hes the head of the Dealers Association.
And I hope you told him to take a long walk.
Theres three votes. We only need two.
I thought about that.
But all he has to do is sayhe cant sell cars with our campaign
and neither marketingnor the factory will fight him.
- So?- So I brought up the subject with Joan.
- You what?- Now, relax.
She seemed more amused than shocked.
And its my opinion,if we brought her the right amount...
So you thought youd have us in herefor coffee and talk about this?
Whats the problem if shes amenable?
She said shed do it?
She said we couldnt afford it.
She has a husband in Vietnamand a baby at home.
And the work will be good enoughto win on its own.
- Plus, its not a guarantee.- No, its not.
Its a guaranteewe wont get it if we dont.
You have some nerve to even ask her.
Thats right.
And you should be thanking me
because weve come too farand are too close
to turning this place intowhat it should be.
Now were going to walk away?
Over what?
Hes one guy and we can win it without him.End of discussion.
Speaking of one guy,how does everyone else feel?
Id love to approach her with, say,
a 10 % finders feeon the first years commission.
Thats $50,000. A flattering amountwhich begs no negotiation.
Im not going to stand in the way,but I am not paying for it.
Not even with our Christmas bonuses?
Maybe Jaguar wasnt meant to be?
I say we take our bonuses and move on.
This is a car. You cannotput a dollar figure on its significance.
Extend our credit line.
Say its for Jaguar.
Well, why dont I look into itto see what we can afford
so you may approach her in the morningwith something definitive?
So, were 75% of this company.
Theres no need to create a conspiracyby having a vote, is there?
Dont fool yourself.This is some very dirty business.
Let her know she can still say no.
You know what?Were not doing this mistress thing.
Its vulgar.Were going back to racing heritage.
- Why?- People think writers horse around
because theyre coming up with ideas.
But, actually, its becausetheyre horsing around.
Now knock off the grab-assand give me some lines.
And dont try to reuse these.They do not apply.
Hey, skipper. You got five seconds?
Five seconds is notenough time to sit down.
Good news.Chevalier Blanc wants to do a pool-out.
- Great.- Peggy was incredible.
She came up with thisLady Godiva bit on the spot.
But in the end, were doingthe same ad as before, but in Paris.
The guy has a beret.
Bid it out. Ginsberg should be free by then.Be nice to get him out of here.
Ginsberg? I thought of this.
- Its his account.- So I guess Im not in charge of everything.
Jesus, Peggy, you know what?
You want to go to Paris? Here.
Go to Paris.
Im not crying.
I didnt think that.
What, were all suddenly interestedin each others lives?
I know for a factthat Jaguars not going to happen.
And he probably does, too.
- I dont care.- Ill get you to Paris.
And if I dont, well both get out of here.
You and your stupid pact.
Save the fiction for your stories.
What can I do for you?
May I?
Signing Jaguar would be disastrousfor the financial health of this company.
You have to stop being afraid.
It would be a defining momentfor our business.
We dont want it that badly.
- All right, get out.- It bears discussion.
I dont know what youre talking about.Now get out.
Well, Im sorry that there was a discussion.
But when a companyis planning on spending $50,000,
there needs to be a discussion.
You were all in there talking about it?
Why does it matterif you have no intention of action?
I dont want them to know I was asked.
Roger Sterling participatedin this discussion?
Yes.
Hes a partner.
If youre against it,why did you tell me that number?
Sounds like a joke.
Because that may be enough moneyto turn your head,
and I wanted a chance to discourage you.
It is a lot of money, Lane.Its four times what I make in a year.
I suppose you wouldnt even be tempted.
Well,
if I were,
I would try to avoid the mistakethat Ive made my entire life.
Every time someones asked mewhat I wanted,
Ive never told them the truth.
And what would you want?
Three years ago,
when I was essentialto the future of this firm,
I settled for much less than I needed.
The cash would only cripple the company
and would do very littleto change your future.
But a partnership
yielding a 5% stake in the company itself
could take care of a womanand a child for a lifetime.
Here I thought you were trying to stop thisbecause you have feelings for me.
Thats why Im looking out for your interestsover the companys.
"Good night, nobody.
"Good night, mush.
"And good night to the old ladywhispering hush."
Hey.
Hows it going?
You want to help us out?Throw some taglines at the wall?
How about,"Jaguar, its your problem, not mine."
May I speak with you?
So thats Megan.
Be careful what you say. Were best friends.
So, youre wearing your audition dress.
What are you hoping I can do for you?
You noticed.
Ive only bad associationswith letting you leave the house in that.
Theres probably 20 girls.And Julias coming with me.
Plus, hes a fairy.
So whatever this is, its not for me.
I want to walk in there with confidence.
I could be in a bikiniand you could paint my body with spots.
Jaguar, try to tame it.
- Dont try and tame it.- Here, kitty, kitty.
So, she just comes and goesas she pleases, huh?
Ginsberg. What?
Yeah, I got it.
You can unplug that if you want.
Arent I interruptingyour routine without me?
Dont be cranky.
I was in a great mood when I left work.
Now Im just exhausted.
So lets go to bed.
If and when we get Jaguar,Im going to need an apartment in the city.
Absolutely not.
Its an epic poem for me to get home.
And youre dressed for bed at dinner.
Peter, lets stop playing games.
What are you talking about?
Im tired of competing.Your love affair with Manhattan is over.
Well, how can you stand livingout here in this cemetery?
Theres nothing to do.Theres no good night noises anywhere.
Because I want to raise my childin the fresh air.
And we should have another on the way.
I mean, it was a miracle the first timeand were not even trying.
Im using all my energyputting my foot down.
Its 8:00. Where were you?
Whats that smell?
The refrigerator is on the fritz.I had to take everything out.
Did you call someone?
His wife wont let him come here anymore.
I dont want to talk about that.
We can afford to have someone elsefix the refrigerator, for Gods sake.
Why wont anyone believe me?Apolo and I are just friends.
You know what? Just hire someone.
Get a colored girl in here.Theyre used to being bossed around.
Do whatever you want.
And what are you doing?
Drying up inside? Because of what? Greg?
I hate him.
I dont want you talking that wayaround Kevin.
Hes a baby. He doesnt knowthat we all wish his father was dead.
Please, stop.
Have you been drinking?
Yes.
Sit down.
Little m*rder called.Four of us got callbacks.
Im supposed to go meetthe playwright tomorrow.
Thats fantastic.
- Thats a big deal.- I know.
You have to promiseyoull come visit every weekend.
Youre going to Broadway, not jail.
No, rehearsal starts in Boston in 10 days.Oh, forget it. Im getting ahead of myself.
Boston?
Yeah, I think thereseight weeks of rehearsals plus previews.
So youre just gonna leavefor three months?
- If they want me.- Well, forget it.
What do you think this is?
You think Im gonna be a singing waitress.Maybe put on a show in the laundry room?
I have to go to work.
You never thought about it becauseyou didnt expect me to make it.
This is the way it works. Now you know.
Just keep doing whatever the hell you want.
Please, come in.
You didnt have to makean appointment, you know.
Yes, I did.
Tell them I want a partnership,
not silent,
comprising 5% of the business.
- Well...- Theres no negotiation.
Okay.
I want documents by the end of the day.
I dont know if thats possible.
Well, Im not guaranteeing results.
I dont think hell have trouble performing.Hes quite ardent.
I meant winning the business.
Yes, of course.
So, I have instructions,but I dont know how this works
in a practical sense.
The presentations tomorrow, isnt it?
So I just call him and have him call you?
Probably not.
Well, how do I...
Figure something out.Do I have to do all of it?
Which one is he?
Hes not bad.
Hes doing this.
Come in.
I know Im not a manager,
but its very hard to get things donewith you in another room.
Well, I obviously have the opposite feeling.
Permission to speak freely?
What?
I know you forbid usfrom thinking about the mistress,
but I kept imagining the assh*lewhos gonna want this car.
Now hes probably alreadygot a lot of beautiful things.
Or maybe he thinks the carwill help him get them.
So I can go on?
And one way or another,what he has isnt enough.
So no matter what,the first idea has got to be
finally, like,youre getting what you wanted.
The copy is still describingthe car as another woman.
But a woman you cant have,
because they have allthe qualities of a Jaguar.
Good-looking, expensive, fast,and, frankly, not practical.
Ive always been fine with all that.
But whats the line?
"Jaguar. At last, something beautifulyou can truly own."
So he threw the money in your face?
I dont even want to talk about it.
Ive never had more responsibility.Im on everything but Jaguar.
I worked on Plymouth at N. W. Ayer.
Car guys are a bunch of creeps.
Theyre all a bunch of creeps.
Could I get some more coffee?
I can never tell, ballerina,
if youre ambitiousor you just like to complain.
Why cant it be both?
Well, if this was about workand not feelings,
youd make a move.
Youre right.
I could take a couple of meetings
and get an offerand throw that in Dons face.
Or you can do what everybody else does.
Have a bunch of meetings,pick a place and leave.


Dont think I havent thought about it.
Well, youd get to find outif you could shine elsewhere.
And I know you can.
And youd let him know thatyoure not some secretary from Brooklyn
whos dying to help out.
I dont know if I can do that.
Sure, you could.You could hire a headhunter
or you could buy a friend a piece of pie.
Of course, if you do move,
you cant complainif I gave Draper a call on my own behalf.
What if Don finds out you helped me?
Dons a big boy.
If he was having this conversation with youand he wasnt the subject of it,
hed tell you to leave in a second.
Thanks.
Ive seen the campaignand its something I couldnt have imagined,
yet exactly what I expected.
Thank you.
And I want you to presentin the fullest confidence.
I think its a winner.
Well, all I wanted to say wasweve removed all other impediments.
But you do know,no matter what else goes on,
its the creative thats going to win this.
Close the door.
It was four to zero.
You abstained in absentia.
The conversation doesnt endjust because you leave the room.
What did you promise her?
A 5% stake as a voting partner.
Dawn, could you buzz Mrs. Harris?
Shes not here.
Actually, Dawn, could you get my things?
Yes, you should be well rested.
I dont want it like this.
It was her idea.
Hello.
Hello. Im Don Draper.I work with Joan. Is she in?
Yes, of course. Please come in.
What?
Shell be right with you.
- I should take your coat.- I wont be long.
Well, I will leave you two alone.
Im really sorry to bother youif this is a bad time.
Well, I was just stepping into the shower,but how can I help you?
I wanted to tell you that its not worth it.
And if we dont get Jaguar, so what?
Who wants to be in businesswith people like that?
I was told everyone was on board.
I said no and they votedwhen I left the room.
Youre a good one, arent you?
So you understand what Im saying?
Yes, I do.
Im all right.
And thank you.
So you have a nice night,and Im gonna go prepare.
- Say good night to your friend.- Good luck tomorrow.
You must get tired of hearingwhat a beautiful thing this car is.
But Ive met a lotof beautiful women in my life.
And despite their protestations,they never tire of hearing it.
But when deep beauty is encountered,it arouses deep emotions
because it creates a desire,
because it is, by nature, unattainable.
You look radiant, Joan.
May I call you Joan? Im Herb, by the way.
Well, I should hope so.
Were taught to thinkthat function is all that matters.
But we have a natural longingfor this other thing.
I got you a little something.
I thought a woman with your complexionwould look good in emerald.
When I was driving the E-Type,
I passed a 10-year-old boyin the back window of a station wagon
and I watched his eyes follow.
Hed just seen something he would wantfor the rest of his life.
I feel like a sultan ofArabyand my tent is graced with Helen of Troy.
Those are two different stories.
Hed just seen that unattainable objectspeed by just out of reach.
Because they do that, dont they?
Beautiful things.
You know, I dont know how much longerI can restrain myself.
Let me see them.
Then I thought about a man of some meansreading Playboy or Esquire.
And flipping past the fleshto the shiny painted curves of this car.
There was no effort to stop his eye.
The difference is he can have a Jaguar.
Well, thank you for a wonderful time.
Youre a hell of a gal.
Oh, this car,
this thing, gentlemen,
what price would we pay?
What behavior would we forgive?
If they werent pretty,if they werent temperamental,
if they werent beyond our reachand a little out of our control,
would we love them like we do?
"Jaguar.
"At last, something beautifulyou can truly own."
What?
Mr. Draper is here to see you.
Whyd you tell him I was here?
Hes your boss. You should see him.
Well, I will leave you two alone.
Im really sorry to bother youif this is a bad time.
Well, I was just stepping into the shower,but how can I help you?
I wanted to tell you that its not worth it.
And if we dont get Jaguar, so what?
Who wants to be in businesswith people like that?
Howd it go?
- Well see.- It was one of his good ones.
- Come have a drink?- Maybe later.
- Where are you from?- New York.
Turn around, please.
Could you step forward, sweetheart,and turn around, please?
You know, I would havetaken you anywhere.
Well, no one comes in here.The foods too bad.
Were not actually gonna eat here, are we?
Im not hungry.
Freddy Rumsen says you are.
And so does Tom Vogel.You know we have Clearasil.
In fact, he sung your praises
while he was yelling at methat the work wasnt as good anymore.
That was my first account.
Everybody else is gonna want to knowif youre married
or planning on having a baby.
And then theyre gonna want to knowhow much you want to be paid.
But all I want to know is,
you must have heardsome pretty terrible things about me
from Don Drapers mouth.
But why would you wantto play for the other team?
Its not a game.
Its my career.
Look, I need a writer.
They dont have to be like me, but...
Do you know anythingabout Ralph Waldo Emerson?
From school.
He said that you have to bea transparent eyeball.
What he meant was,you have to take in the world
and pass it through you.
I am tired of peoplewho treat this like math.
I looked at your book and I saw somebody
who was writing likeevery product was for them.
No clichés, no homilies, no formula.
Well, I had a lot of help.
Everybody does.
So I lied to you.
What do you want to get paid?
Freddy tell you to do this?
You already know you want to go.
You know how much youll do it for.
And you didnt make me wait.
Im going do you the same favor.
If this is your last meeting.
I think I need a chocolate shake.
First day of work ends withyou and me at La Caravelle.
- Youre here.- Im here.
Howd it go?
How did yours go?
Were waiting to hear.
I bet you were great.
I bet you were, too.
- The difference is I want you to get it.- Stop it.
Well, you get to disappear for workwhenever you want.
And if I have to choosebetween you and that,
Ill choose you.
But Ill hate you for it.
You know I dont want you to fail.
Good.
Because Im not going to.
Dont run away like that.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Miss Olson wants to see you.
Peggy, come on in.
- DArcys out.- Says who?
Arthurs girl told me on the QT.She said he was in his office crying.
Jaguar is callingthe president of every agency.
- Dancerjust got a big "No, thanks."- DArcy is out, too.
Get the partners in my officeand wait for further instructions.
Roger Sterlings office.
I want all the partners here.
You cant leave him on hold.
Wheres Pete?
Just answer it.
Hello? Hugh, how are you this morning?
Im glad to hear that. We like him, too.
- Well, that is terrific news.- Bravo.
- This is spectacular.- Great.
Well be over this afternoonto kiss the bride.
He said it wasnt even close.
- Well, congratulations to everyone.- We got to get champagne.
I promise you theyre opening it right now.
Before everybodys too drunk,I need a list of names.
I promised them wed staff up immediatelyand were going over there today.
Cant we wait to see whatthe scope of the campaign will be?
Is this about the bonuses again?There are no bonuses this year.
Now, next year...
Joan, shall we address the men?
Congratulations.
You wanted to talk to me?
Youre not busy?
Im not in the mood.
You really have no ideawhen things are good, do you?
I swear,I dont really need to talk right now.
Drink with me.
I have to talk aboutsomething kind of serious.
I cant put a girl on Jaguar.
These car guys...
I just cant.
- But, you know...- Its not that.
Is this about Joan being made partner?
What?
The circumstances...
Shes been with us 13 years.
I want you to know that
the day you saw something in me
my whole life changed.
And since then, its been my privilege
to not only be at your side,but to be treated like a protégée
and for you to be my mentorand my champion.
But?
But
I think Ive reached a point
where its time for meto have a new experience.
Really?
Im giving my notice.
Ive accepted another offer.
- Are you done?- Im giving the customary two weeks.
My last day will be the third.
- And dont think...- Hold on.
Its been crazy around hereand I know Ive been taking you for granted.
And, frankly, Im impressed.
You finally picked the right momentto ask for a raise.
Its time for me to move on.
Come on.
Im serious.
Youre serious?
It wasnt easy.
Im sure it wasnt.
Well, good for you. Where are you going?
Cutler Gleason and Chaough.
Perfect.
Okay.
Well, lets pretend Im not responsible
for every single good thingthats ever happened to you,
and you tell me the number or make one up
and Ill b*at it.
Theres no number.
Theres no number?
How long do you want to play this out?
Im sorry,
but you know this is what you would do.
You dont need to wait until the third.
Ive got a room full offreelancers out there.
Ill get by.
I understand.
Dont be a stranger.
