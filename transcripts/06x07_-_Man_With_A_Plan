the union of these two agencieshas already brought us victory.
Our congratulationsto Mr. Chaough
and Mr. Gleason for their recentvictory at the Clio Awards
for the one-minute televisioncommercial Little Headaches
on behalf of St. JosephsChildrens Aspirine."
( applause )
"In closing..."
Well, thatsa beautiful message
to read to our employees,
but perhaps its best to wait
until weve made allof the personnel changes.
And you need an ending.
We have a lotof writers out there.
Im sorry.Someone commandeered Clara.
I need a seat.
Don took the last one.
That means you werehere after Don.
Can you see if theresanother chair?
Or you could have my seat.
Yes, thank you.
Moira, take my chair.
Now that weve dispensedwith the gallantry,
Jim Cutler and I have,we believe, harvested
the gold dusting of the Clios
by arranging foran advanced introduction
to Fleischmanns Margarine.
They want to be Tedand Dons first love child.
Thats new business.
Isnt there a section of thismeeting called good news?
I never would have taken youfor such a stickler.
Fleischmanns? Groovy.Well get right on it.
Regarding ongoing business,
the following is a list of currentaccounts in ascending order.
That means smallest to largest,
Chevrolet being excludedfor a separate meeting.
Topaz Pantyhose.
Ken Cosgrove and Burt Peterson.
- And theyre thrilled.- Leica Camera.
Roger and I mighthave to go to Germany.
But thats only becausewe invited ourselves.
The New York State Thruway.
I just got off the phone
with Henry Lammottat Mohawk Airlines...
Mohawks on the next page.
This is related to the Thruway.
Henry Lammottconsiders it a conflict,
car travel and air travelbeing mortal enemies.
So when Burt Peterson gets aholdof them, we should resign.
Did you tell Lammottthat was a stretch?
Its a $250,000 media budget.
Mohawk is an airline.
Except, Ted, the clientis New York State
and they gave ustheir media buy up front.
- And you already spent it.- Why didnt you tell us that?
Why didnt you tell us you lost Vicksfor yourself and Clearasil for us?
Why didnt you tell usFrank Gleason was dying?
Franks going to be fine.
I know Henry Lammott.
Pete and I will fly up there.
And Ted.
Of course.
What kind of plane do you have?
A Mohawk plane.
Teds a pilot.
Ill take us up there.
We can landright outside his office.
- Even better.- Im sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Campbell, theres anurgent phone call for you.
However were going,
I recommend we go up tomorrow.
Whats the next client?
Um, Koss Headphones.
Jim: Burt Petersonand Ken Cosgrove.
They sent Burt Petersona case of champagne.
Billy?
Mr. Campbell,I didnt want to trouble you,
but she was...
shes right here.You want to talk to her?
What happened exactly?
Well, she was bangingon the door pretty hard,
saying she neededto see your father.
I thought somebodywas gonna call a cop.
May I speak with her?
Bill, youve been so decent,I hate to ask you another favor,
but could you get hera G and T with two ice cubes?
- Gin and tonic?- Yes, if you dont mind.
I dont know whats going on,
but I found this addresson my nightstand
in some womans handwriting
and I assumed your fatherwas up to his old tricks.
Mother, he passed away.
Youd like that.No.
He hasnt been homefor over a week
and his golf clubsare still at the house.
( ice cracks )
Mother, you sound confused.
What are you implying?
I want you to relax,watch the television,
and I will call Budto come and get you.
Hes going to sendthat girl Trudy.
Buds wife is Judy, not Trudy.
Now I suppose Im crazyfor mixing those up.
Tell Billy youre fineon your own.
I am.
( sighs )
Hello there.
Nice to see you, Peggy.
Burt.
Were a long wayfrom Sterling Cooper.
Looks like the worm has turned.
Well, its nice to havethe old team back together.
- ( phone ringing )- Do you want me to get that?
Hello.
Oh, I was expectinga secretary.
There isnt oneon the line, is there?
Hold on.
Ive got to take this.
Well, well have plentyof time to catch up
on those flights to Detroit.
Hes still a cold fish.
Hello.
Come over here now.
I cant.
I have too muchgoing on in the office.
I need you
and nothing else will do.
Oh.
So?
12:30 atthe Sherry-Netherland.
Call me with a room number.
Come on in, Burt.
Have a seat.
What is this, a bed?
Yeah, you might wantto lie down
because here we are again.
Well, I haventforgotten anything.
Not a damn thing.
A lot of times in lifeyou get to do something
and you dont realizeuntil its over
how much you enjoyed it.
And you swear that thenext time it comes around,
youre gonna remember that.
Youre right.
And I think I canwork with you, too.
Work?
No, Burt, Im lettingyou go again.
What the hell?You... you cant do that.
Probably doesnt make a difference atthis point, but no one fought for you.
Well, well see what the folksat Chevy have to say about this.
Remember Ken Cosgrove?
Like a six-foot versionof Alan Ladd?
Hes touringthe plant right now.
You bastard.
Ive got four millionin billings.
- What have you got?- I was thinking you would feel that way.
That you had more clientsand that gives you a voice.
I was imagining you talkingover me in meetings.
Now I dont have that problem.
My clients will leave with me.
( chuckles ) No one will eversay you werent funny, Burt.
Well, Ill tell you one thing,
Im expecting some kindof severance.
Who knows?Were really hurting.
Were having to cut back.Well, obviously.
God, youre a real prick,you know that?
Damn it, Burt,you stole my good-bye.
Oh, hello.You must be Burt Peterson.
Im Bob Benson.Im supposed to report to you.
Well, as a first orderof business,
I recommend that you stickyour head between your legs
and kiss your ass good-bye.
What did you say to me?
Come see me.
No.
I need you
and nothing else will do.
You worked on the Daisy?
No, I worked on the KKK spot.
You probably heard about it.It was too hot to run.
- Thats very impressive.- Thank you.
I mean, you made it 15 minutesbefore you brought it up.
( chuckles )
I just spoke with Dawn.
Black or white?
She wouldnt tell me anything.
Shes an excellent secretary.
Im sure he can catch up.
So, before we inundate ourselveswith Fleischmanns unique benefits
and previous work,I want to, I dont know,
have a little rap sessionabout margarine in general.
You mean like in termsof the prospect?
Just whatevers on your mind.Free-associate.
- ( whispers )- My grandmother.
Yeah.
Yellow.
Yes.
Greasy.
Its not butter.Its cheap.
It has no smell.
Yeah, man.Keep going.
People hate it.
Hold on a second.Who hates margarine?
You said there wereno wrong answers.
- I didnt say that.- I dont hate it.
It was inventedfor Napoleon III
because armies need to moveand it never spoiled.
Thats fantastic.
How did you know that?
I dont know, I just did.
Lets get down10 uses for margarine.
French army is number one.
And of course I was upset
because I was waitingfor Mitchell to call.
Then Arnie tells meto cut the apron strings.
All of France is on fire.
I dont even knowif the phones are working.
Theres no room for me to worryabout anyone but Arnold,
not even our son.
You can talk about your kid,
but I dont want to hearabout your husband.
I can talk aboutwhatever I want.
Can you help me lookfor my shoes while you do it?
You want me to lookfor your shoes?
I want you to crawl on your handsand knees until you find them.
( scoffs )
Theyre right over there.
Do it.
I want you to get undressed,
then get back into bed.
Come over here.
( key jangles )
Dont go anywhere.
Im hearing a lot about bread.
It spreads easybecause its soft.
Really melts into the...
What did he just say?
Don.There you are.
Sorry about that.I got held up.
Lets not push too hard today.
- Whatd I miss?- We got some good ideas,
and I think were ready fora more traditional approach...
research, et cetera...later in the week.
Great.Peggy, you set the meeting.
What was that?
What? You calledthe meeting to a close.
You also had it without me.
If the meetings at 1:00,the meetings at 1:00.
Don, five minutes,10 minutes...
Ive been working in creativemy whole life, its fine.
40 minutes?Come on.
Ive got better things to do,
but obviously you did, too.
( ringing )
Hello.
Are you still in bed?
Are you on your way?
Youre going to wait there
and youre not going to knowwhen Im coming back.
Whats gotten into you?
Dont answer the phone again.
( ringing )
( intercom buzzes )
- Yes?- Moira: Mr. Draper is here to see you.
Send him in.
- Am I bothering you?- What is that?
An olive branch.
I was just thinkingthat its probably best
if we talk aboutmargarine by ourselves.
Sorry, I dont knowwhat you drink.
Whatever there is.
Of course, everythingis packed away.
I would have opened that first.
Might have clients coming in.
I have something betterfor the clients.
I have this bar cartwheeled in.
How is that better?
You should see the girlwho wheels it in.
Its quite a presentation.
If you dont want to drink,you dont have to drink.
So, you want to show meyour notes from the meeting?
It took 40 minutes to figure outno one knows shit about margarine.
( chuckles )
May I?
Is this gonna be Detroit again?
Youre gonna lie downon the couch while I pace?
Ill lie down afterwe have our next one.
Lets get somethingon paper first.
- Where is she?- Well, she spent 25 minutes
looking for a dish for the nuts andthen she went into the bathroom.
- Good luck.- Where are you going?
Shes using the ladies room.Shes been doing it for years.
- No, take her home.- My home?
- Thats not an option.- That is the only option.
Do you have any ideawhats going on in my office?
Were in the middleof a merger,
in case you didnt getpast the sports section.
Im supposed to suddenlycare after you went
to White Weld to underwriteyour public offering?
I caught a shovelfulfor that, Pete.
I got to pretend to my partnersthat you dont believe in nepotism.
I apologize that you didntget on that sinking ship.
You just ride out this merger,
and in six monthsIm your first call.
You dont understand. I wentto a meeting this morning
- and there was no chair for me.- Youre as high-strung as her.
First you dont have a chair,then you dont have any clients.
- Mother, its time to go.- Dont do that yet.
Just getyour thoughts together.
- You have a long drive home.- She has an apartment.
Even the cleaning woman quit.
Mothers cut all ties. The wholeplace smells like a rabbit warren.
Judy and I have taken our turn.Now its yours.
No, that is not going to work.( toilet flushes )
( sighs ) Judy isfinished with her.
They got in a dispute aboutEarl Grey or Major Grey
and Mother snapped her with atea towel across the face.
She should be locked up.
Maybe we can getthe paperwork started.
In the meantime,buy Trudy a catchers mask
and be happy that you getto go to work every day.
I know why hes latefor everything.
Because weve put up with it.
I mean, honestly, is Peterany busier than you are?
Mother, Im Peter.
Do you want to goto the Colony?
Thats a splendid idea.
No, I have some soup.
Just take me home.
Youre spending the night here.You can have the bed.
I never sleep.
And you should be well rested.
Could you freshen this?
So Blue Bonnetis the girl in pigtails?
Mary Ann.
"Gilligans Island"always works.
Every brand is represented.
So Fleischmanns isthe Marilyn Monroe redhead?
I dont know whos Ginger.
Probably Parkay.
Then youve gotThurston Howell...
Imperial with the crown.
I think the one thats wideopen is the Professor.
Facts and figures,health benefits.
Some kind of formula.
Theyre all made differently,
even if its just location.
No, I find it interesting
that youve broken this downinto a formula.
Theres a lot of bridgesto Manhattan.
You dont have any tricks forwhen youre stuck other than...
Are we stuck already?
Lets take the competitionto a broader level.
Lets say there are more margarinesthan characters on your TV show.
They all havesomething in common.
They all want off the island.
No, theyre all not butter.
- No one prefers margarine.- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have to eat something.
Doesnt ice count?
Id settle for some more toast.
Ahem.
( sighs )
Its morning.
We know because we seethe rooster crow.
A farmers wife sets pancakeson the kitchen table.
She puts a patof margarine on top.
Then sets the dish down nextto the yellowest fried eggs,
a loaf of homemade bread,
and a beading pitcherof heavy cream.
Syrup pours.
A smile comes overtheir Dorothea Lange faces.
Two things... cows
because shes a dairyfarmers wife,
and I want bacon.
Its not up for debate.
( knocking )
_
( knocks )Joan: Just a minute.
I said just a minute.
I thought you said come in.
I got everyones paperwork.I just wanted to drop them off.
You look a little wan.
I think I have food poisoning.
Do you want some ice water?
Oh! God...
Do you have your appendix?
- Its the other side.- You cant stay here.
And I cant leave, either.
Just walk with me and Illbother you all the way out.
No one will know.
So I get the laxativepeople into the booth
and I record threeor four spots at one time.
Who talked Topazinto television?
I did, but thenMargie took it over.
The client stillcalls me Peggy.
Everybody, everybody.
Im taking a survey.
Its Eugene McCarthyversus Bobby Kennedy.
How many for Kennedy?
Show of hands.
But Humphreyhas all the delegates.
Im voting for Nixon.
Oh, I knew it, Mathis.
Whats wrong with you?
Dont you have any hope?
Im for Bobby.
Well, I... Ted?
You okay?
Why dont you call it a day?
Come on.
- What about him?- Let him sleep it off.
Ted, come on.
Im fine.
( man coughing )
( woman talking over PA )
Drink that.
- Is that urine?- Its the pipes.
The babysittersagreed to stay,
but no word from yourmother, so Im not leaving.
Shes probably stillin the k*ll.
Remember Rip Van Winkle?
You like that story?
I know it.I could tell it to you.
No, you should go.
Who knows what 20 yearswill do to this place.
I have no place to go.
Whats gonna happen to Kevin?
Hell either end upwith my mother
or Gregs parents.
Its just food poisoning.
( groans )
No, thats not what it is.
Come on.Lets go.
Ive got you.
Excuse me,Nurse... Finnegan.
I see how busy you are, butcan I trouble you a moment?
Doctors will see youthe moment they can.
No, its not about that.
Its just, well,Im such a fool
and I suppose I wastrying to be a gentleman,
- but my friend here, she...- Dont.


We dont need to see a doctor.
Im sure its something that would becovered by your medical expertise.
What are you talking about?
Shes a little embarrassed,
but she drank furniture polish.
Honey, whyd you do that?
She wasnt wearing her glasses.
You do need to see a doctor.Why didnt you tell me that?
Im sorry. I reallynever know what to do.
I thought Id justleave it up to you.
Okay, sweetheart.Ramirez.
Take her to bed four.
( woman speaking over PA )
Shell be fine.
( lock clicking )
You look perfect.
Well, I had three hoursto get ready.
I dont know if the shoes go.
They do.
Where are we going?
Were not going anywhere.
Are you kidding me?
Why would you thinkyoure going anywhere?
You are for me.
You exist in this roomfor my pleasure.
Are we going to eat?
Dont ask any more questions.
Take off your dress.
Take off everything for me.
Like that?
( thunder rumbling )
I think you lookworse than I do.
Well, I slept onthe floor of my office.
They didnt give you a couch?
I couldnt find it.Draper knocked me out.
Not literally.
Im sure theresa lot of work to do.
Its got nothingto do with work.
He seems more interested in methan he is in the work.
But youre notvery interesting.
He doesnt know that.
Whats he like?
Hes mysterious.
But I cant tellif hes putting it on.
He doesnt talkfor long stretches,
and then hesincredibly eloquent.
Hes very successful.
You didnt thinkhe was charmless, did you?
You learned to work with me.
And look at you.
If I wait patientlyby the river,
the body of my enemywill float by.
( sighs )Such a waste of energy.
Give him the early rounds.Hell tire himself out.
Go home, shower,
walk back in therelike you own half the place.
Ill be back at dinnertime.
Because you live here.
No, I dont.
Theres a hamperfull of laundry
and a razor in the sink.
Is Trudy finished with you?
This is our pied-à-terre.
Does your fatherbring prostitutes here
or is it just for yours?
I want to be taken home.
Your apartmentsbeen overrun with vermin.
Theyre spraying all day.
Oh.
I didnt remember that.I want to get my things.
Its raining very hard outand its, well...
its St. Patricks Day.
- Its May.- No, its not.
And who knows whats out there?
Ill have the cook makeyour favorite for dinner.
( door closes )
- Morning.- You look fresh.
Wheres my secretary?
Or is this howthey do it at CGC,
just let yourself in?
I didnt want to wait out there
because this whole visitis confidential.
You want to quit already?
When you told meabout the merger,
I hoped he wouldrub off on you,
not the other way around.
Hes gettingeverything he wants
and obviouslyyoure on his side.
Why did you do it at allif there are sides?
You could have just triedto hire me back.
You never evenasked me to lunch.
Yes, Peggy, we riskedour entire company
just so I could have you inthis office complaining again.
Well, he cant drink like you.
And you must know thatbecause nobody can.
- Peggy, hes a grown man.- So are you.
Move forward.
( door closes )
Youre going to be fine.With Burt Peterson gone,
Kenny in Detroit, everythingsgoing to fall in your in-box.
What about Cutler?
What about every timetheres a change around here,
I get knocked downto a worse office?
( knocks ) Come in, Scarlett.
Mr. Campbell,Im sorry to interrupt,
but youre needed on the phone.
What now, Clara?
Is she injured?
No, but theres been a fire.
( sighs ) Call Henry at Mohawk.See if he can meet tomorrow.
I have no idea how longthis will take.
Trudy?
( door closes )
( rain pattering )
I dont know what it is.
I just dont wantto think about anything.
Who told youyou were allowed to think?
So, what do I do now?
You fall asleepthe minute I close that door.
Im flying upstate,
and when I come back,I want you ready for me.
I can do thatstanding on my head.
And Im taking this.
Really?Come on.
Im taking it.
Somethings come up.Do you have a minute for Clara?
Pete Campbells secretary.
Certainly.
Mr. Campbell had an emergencyand Mr. Draper is out,
so I wanted to make sure youknew that we were rescheduling
this afternoonsmeeting with Mohawk.
Absolutely not.
What the hellis going on around here?
( knocks ) Ready to go?
I am, but apparently PeteCampbell wants to move it.
We cant cancelthe meeting to show a client
how important he is.When can he go?
It doesnt matter. We shouldgo up there right away.
Its raining pretty hard.We can wait a couple hours.
Dont worry about that. Once were abovethe clouds, its sunny as summer.
( plane rattling )
How long have youbeen doing this?
Not now.
There we go.
You can relax now.Were leveled off.
I am relaxed.
( rattles )
Sometimes when youre flying,
you think youre right side up,but youre really upside down.
Really?
Got to watch your instruments.
You dont want to take inthe wonder of Gods majesty?
I like to read on planes.I dont like to talk.
But youre gonna talkto Henry Lammott.
I mean, youre the onethat knows him.
Does it matter?
No matter what I say,
youre the guy who flew usup here in his own plane.
I guess thats true.
I dont know if Joanies awake.
I really dont need to see her.
You can just giveKevin my gift.
Oh. Oh.
( chuckles ) Hello.
I really wasnt planningon dropping in.
I just wanted to seeif you were feeling better.
The hospital wouldnt tell me anythingbecause Im not immediate family.
Hes two years old.Hell play with the bow.
- ( laughs )- Sit down. Have a snack.
No, thats all. Dont want to beaway from the office too long.
Although I leftmy overcoat on my chair,
so they know Im there.
Well, its nice meeting you.
Hes adorable.
Hes too young.
I can tell you from experience
that younger men are notintimidated by powerful women.
- Hes not interested.- He saved your life.
It was just a cyst on my ovary.
I would have been fine.Hes worrying about his job.
Well, why wouldnt he?
It doesnt take awaywhat he did.
Honestly, Joan, every good deed
is not part of a plan.
She left the teakettle on.It was mostly smoke.
Can you get Henry Lammotton the phone?
I will, but Mr. Lammottalready called for you.
Don and Ted thoughtit was best not to wait.
Really?They went without me?
Yes. Apparently itwent very well.
Damn it, Clara.They went without me.
Therefore, it did notgo very well.
You do understand that youremployment here is tied to me?
And if thingshappen without me,
theyll eventuallyhappen without you.
Dont feel bad that you weretaking care of your mother.
My mother can go to hell.
Ted Chaough can fly her there.
Do you want me to getMr. Lammott on the phone?
Can you give me a minute?
( door closes )
Im here.
Where are you going?
I think its time to go home.
Not yet.
I think this is over.
Its over when I say its over.
I had a dream that youcrashed in that plane.
But Im back.
I dreamt I went to your funeral
and Megan cried on my shoulder.
- Stop it.- And then I went back to Arnold
and I made love to himand I said,
"Ive been away,but Im home."
It means you missed me.
No.
It means its timeto really go home.
This is over,
and not just this.
Its easy to give up somethingwhen youre satisfied.
Its easy to give up something
when youre ashamed.
Please.
Lets go.
Burt Petersons gone.That leaves me,
Jim Torkelson,and Lawrence Harris.
Youve got Roger, Pete,Ken, and Bob Benson.
But youve got your creativesPeggy, Cecil, and Beanie.
We lost Margie, Koch,and Steve Hagan.
I dont know who Peggycounts for, but we need Bob.
Bobs got to go.Last hired, first fired.
Very well.
But before I cross him off,let me remind you
that Bob has been veryinvolved in Kens accounts,
and with Ken servicing Detroit,
I dont know how long itlltake Lawrence to catch up.
Fine, Lawrence is gone.Are we done here?
The secretarial staff?
( elevator humming )
( elevator bell dings )
And instead of being afraid,
I realized I should just askfor a couple of weeks off.
They write people outall the time.
Or I could sh**t in advance
and maybe we could goto Honolulu again.
This time without business.
I just thought it wouldbe fun to go on a trip,
the two of us for a bitwithout the kids.
( voice fades out )
Peter.
They sh*tthat poor Kennedy boy.
That was years ago, Mother.
I just saw iton the television.
( sighs )Its 6:00 AM.
Youll be late for school.
Please just let me sleep.
I dont understandwhats going on.
Theyre sh**ting everybody.
