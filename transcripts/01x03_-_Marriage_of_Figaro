I laughed.I think its brilliant.
Brilliant,Ill tell you what brilliance in advertising is-    cents.
Somebody thought of that campbell.
Well say what you want.Loveit or hate it the fact remains,
weve been talking about thisfor the last    minutes...
and this is "playboy.
Course what we shouldve beentalking about is c-core laxative...

I dont want to hear this.
Were on the case.
Part of this job is doingthings you dont wanna do.
Most of it.
Its good to beback,draper.I missed you.
Then it must notvebeen much of a honeymoon.
Im sorry,welcome back.
Hows married life?
Its pretty swell.
I was raised that mendont wear jewelry.

Maybe we can.
You know girls wed behappy to bring you coffee.
I was on my way over anyways.Ihave something of yours.
Lady chaterleys lover"- I finished it last night.
Good to the last drop,right?
I can see why it got banned.
well you dont have to be soshy about it,its literature.
That is a huge pocketbook,joan.
Well it has a change ofclothing and a toothbrush in it.
Ah,a hope chest.
Have you read this,peggy?
I dont think thats agood idea.Theres,um...
this word in it a lot.
I know the word,joan.
Well its sad really because evenwith its reputation,men wont read it.
And they really should.
I dont care ifits    -years-old,
its another testimony to how mostpeople think marriage is a joke.
- They rip a lot of clothing.- Yeah its a fantasy.
Hes married and shes married,thedesperate passion of the forbidden.
Can I borrow it?
Shes making it sound better then it is.
Theres a few good parts thats all.
and the book just opensto those pages by itself.
Hey dont read it on the train.
Itll attract the wrong element.
- Bye.- Bye.
So the doctor says tohim,"I hope youre happy.
While you were out finishing a round ofgolf,"your wife was in a horrible accident.
She is gonna need round the clock care- "bathing,toilet.
Then the doc looks at him andsays,"Im just kidding,"shes dead.
Hey whatd ya sh**t?
well we have and initial research report
and what I think are some veryastute market observations.
Mr.Draper.
Pleased to see you didnt disappearthe minute you cashed my check.
We appreciate your business.
Kenny or course you know.
Harry crane,media andmr.George pallham over here
who is from research and who has moredegrees then a russian protractor.
Thats quite an introduction.
From the other side of the pond I see.
We take his word for it.
So,uh,that is yours to keep butif youd like to follow along.
Youll see from the overviewour primary focus was saks,
henri bendel and bonwit taylor.
Our research uncovered a variety of optionsthey utilize to attract your desired customers.
One thing these stores have in commonis a comfortable shopping environment.
Spacious open salesfloors,analmost conspicuous lack of clutter.
The merchandise is minimal and neatlypresented on tables and in display cases.
This less is more philosophy isalso efferent in the window displays.
For example,only one sweater to a window
as opposed to windowsstuffed with merchandise.
My fathers going to love that.
Believe it or not it evenapplies to the mannequins.
Bendles takes the heads off theirs sothe shopper can imagine them to be anyone.
Anyone without a head.
Along with these cosmetic changes,youll alsoneed to provide what we call "boutique extras.
A personal shopping service,privatefashion shows,designer collections.
This is comprehensive.
Its the lay of the land.
Just from holding it I feel moreinformed about my competitors then ever.
And yet my store already has a personalshopping service and designer collections,
which makes me wonder if youwere so focused on my competitors
that you failed to visit my store.
Ive been away on my honeymoon.
Ive been there a few times.
Its a beautiful old place.
Miss menken i can assure you that no oneat this table has ever been to your store.
A wrong I will personallycorrect this afternoon.
Its right on  th ave.
Thats one big block overand a dozen little blocks up.
Its been there for    years.
- Ill walk you out.- Ive got it.
- Harry.- What?
Its nice the way you handled that.
Its hard to get caught in a lie.
Well it wasnt a lie.
It was ineptitude withinsufficient cover.
something about the way you talkalways restores my confidence.
I have a deep voice.
This afternoon then.
Its a date.
new junior exec.
changing her store could take six months,ora year if I know whats good for me.
- What was that in there?- What?
Don and molly goldberg,did you see that?
- Yeah I caught it,whats your point?- I dont know.
I mean everybody always jokes about it
but Ive never seen draperreally turn that switch on before.
Well I guess he likesher.What would you do?
Trying to quit.
You arreally putting thejunior in junior executive.
Look,youre married now,right?
Im a part of that club now too.
Two very happy years,butwhen Im out in the world...
I dont know.I dont do it much.
Im not good at it-- theflirting,the double intandras.
You mean something on the side?
No I mean enjoying the company of womenin the limited way a married man can.
Well thats all we have really.
- I cant speak for everyone but its plenty for me.- I see.
I guess on some level I alwaysthought draper was the same way.
Draper?Who knowsanything about that guy?
No ones ever lifted that rock.
He could be batman for all we know.
mr.Campbell,your wifes on the phone.
Theres bird shit on thecouch!That was priceless.
Hello,honey.
Dinner?Wow,what do i want for dinner?
I dont know.
Anything but chicken.
Yes,they missed me.
Uh,ribeye in the pan with butter.
Ice cream.
I love you too.
Theres going to be dinnerwaiting for me when I get home.
Yeah,how about that?
mr.Curland is mitigating askirmish in our housewares section.
Why do I hire young girls?
Because they cost practically nothing.
Costume change.
This is my closet.
The original tenants laid the lastbrick the day before the crash.
Boy,were they in for a surprise.
As I hope you note by now,ouroriginal store was just off  th avenue.
It was just hosiery,then they startedpulling piecework from sweatshops.
By     ,those people had failed-- my fatherand uncle picked this place up for a sheckle.
Well,it is...
crowded,but that might havesomething to do with the sale,
which means that if were successfulyoure gonna lose the customers you have
in order to get the customers you want.
I was gonna start with raising prices.
Can you imagine what my father said?
Well,you do have to give them somethingfor their higher dollar counts.
Its just...
awfully hard to define what that is.
How may I help you?
I make them say that.
carol,can we see this tray right here?
Sea horses,crowns,lucky dice...
medieval knights.
Thats better.
Thank you.
Lets take a look at the second floor.
Were known for our service.
- Thats gotta be a tough job.- I know.
Ive always liked howquiet it is up here.
Well,that might explainthe lack of customers.
I can see the charm,but...
the room is too dark,too oldfashioned.The products look old.
But the people look wonderful.
yknow,its a shame were gonnahave to lop their heads off.
Itll ruin your favoritepart of the store.
Its not my favorite part,actually.
the grand lot of usare going to lanskyS.
Can you believe it?
Have a swell time.Ive got plans.
You look nice.
hell--manhattan at yourfeet.I can see the appeal.
The views okay.
no,this is my favoritepart of the store.
Hey there,missy.
Havent seen you in a while.
How did they get the penthouse?
They patrol.
Its the only way to make sure thereisnt anyone hiding in the store at night.
They know Im with you,right?
These two are carla and leona.
Not the originals-- itsthe third generation.
And what every generation of menken dogshall be named until the end of time.
I made my fathers legal counsel add thatto the stores bylaws when I was nine.
So even then you enjoyedtelling men what to do.
To be fair,the storewas practically home.
My father liked to work.
I used to come out here and talk tothem-- well,the originals-- every night.
For a little girl,adogcan be all you need.
They protect you,they listen.
I had my sister,but therewerent other kids and
of course,my mother wasnt around.
Well,thats not always a bad thing.
Who knows?
She died when she was having me.
Anyway,my sister became myonly company,and,frankly,
these bitches were easier to handle.
What is this?
Dont try to convince methat you were ever unloved.
I dont know what to say.
Listen...
Im married.
I guess I didnt askcause I didnt wanna know.
Shouldnt have happened.
Well,you couldnt help yourself.
I knew what I wanted.
From the first time youstormed out of our office.
You stormed out of your office.
I took you up here--that was stupid.
I just so looked forwardto seeing you again.
Now I guess thats over.
I know you understand Id rathernot have to explain this to anyone.
The account stays,Ijust...want someone else on it.
Dont look at me like that.
What do you do,just kiss women allthe time?Women you arent married to?
Of course not.
Well,then am I supposed to livesome life running alongside yours?
I have some checks to sign.

You dropped your paper.
Thank you.

He does.Hes very determined.
Jack really gets angry anytimesomeone mentions the vaccine

First of all,it couldhave been much worse.
It could have gotten to his lungs.
Second of all,this canthappen to other children.
They think theyre athletes.
