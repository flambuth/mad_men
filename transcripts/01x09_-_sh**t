Mommy, look at that!
Hello.
Don Draper. How are you?
Probably about like you:Enduring the splendor of Fiorellol
You know we gotthat Israeli tourism thing, right?
Mazel tov.
I ran into Jim Jordan from BBDOat the Athletic Club
with, uh, Frank from Y&R.
Your name came up.
Three millionairesin towels in a steam room.
I dont know how to take that.
Take it as a compliment,
a sign that youredestined for greater things.
I think "Jesus Over Rio"was the best tourist campaign
Ive seen in over 20 years.
Wasnt good enoughto land the Israelis.
Ah, thats not you.
Thats the tiny store you work in.
Now, if you were with me at McCann,
youd have over 500 peopleat your disposal...
and thats just in New York.
We can get a lot of things done.
Can you get me outof the second half of this show?
All Im saying is youve done your timein the farm leagues.
Yankee Stadium is on the line.
I changed my mind.
I decided you deserve a visit to the bar.
Adele, this is Donald Draper.
If were being introduced,I assume that youre in advertising.
Would you both liketo talk about that some more?
Betty.
My wife.
Jim and Adele Hobart.
Hello. Betty Draper.
A pleasure.
Your husband here was about to prove
that he can speak about thingsother than advertising.
Oh, hes very interesting.
Well, then, come with me.
Lets get those drinks.
Well be back.
Champagne?
Besides getting the handsome prince,are you an actress or something?
No, Im a housewife.
I did do some modeling...a lifetime ago.
Im not surprised.
That is some face youve got there.
Anybody ever tell youyoure a dead ringer for Grace Kelly?
They used to.
You know what?
Coca-Colas deep into this, uh,
international campaign right now.
A European face like yours,like Grace Kellys,
might be a road we could go down.
Uh, we could put a call outfor a Grace Kelly type,
but, uh, I dont think wed come this close.
You say youve modeled?
Im retired.
This is silly.
Think about it.
Your coloring with a green bottleand an Irish setter...
Oh, drink up.
Its back to Tammany Hall.
I like the show.
Very gay songs.
Well, wed better get back in there or leave.
Come on.
Uh, it was very nicemeeting both of you.
Why didnt you wantto go to dinner with Jim and Adele?
People like Jim Hobartalways talk business
because they havenothing else to say.
I can see that.
You know, he gave me his card.
Really?
Did he tell you to put itunder my pillow of something?
No. Actually, he was talking to meabout modeling.
Was he?
I dont think it was like that.
He said something about Grace Kellyand Coca-Cola.
Well, then, theres no needto doubt his interest, then.
I did model, Don.
Am I that wrong for Coca-Cola?
Youre not wrong for anything.
So are you going to go there?
How was Fiorello exclamation point?
Ltll be six months before I can get Donback into a Broadway theater.
Oh, we ran into this agency head.
Apparently hes courting Don.
He gave me his card.
Asked me if I wanted to do any modeling.
Thats a heck of a line.What did Don say?
He basically said the man was tryingto sleep with one of us
and that he didnt like the idea of either.
I did do some modeling, you know.
I did not know, but Im not surprised.
Carlton calls you Grace Kelly.
I was a model when I met Don.
A model in Manhattan?
Yes.
It was exciting.
But when I got started...
the summer after college, in Italy.
Italy?
There was this Italian designer: Giovanni.
He wanted to be called Johnny.
Thats how much he loved Americans.
Well, he loved American girls.
It was more of an artist/muse relationship.
Okay.
So... he made you all this,and it was platonic?
No petting, nothing?
Mamma mia.
And put my hair up like this.
And Salvatore said he hasthe Menkens artwork,
and to meet him in the art department
because youre goingto need a red pencil.
Any other good news?
I think the mail boydropped that off for you last night.
Peggy, can you get mean outside line?
Right away.
Don Draper.
Now, why would youcall me out of the blue?
I appreciate the gesture.
Its not a gesture, Don,its an overture.
Let me tell you, yourea hard man to run into.
I dont know what to say.
Dont say anything.
The next step is a quiet rendezvous.
The Algonquin?
Theres a small hotel.
Isnt that the song?
I dont know. Im...
Im not ready to wave the flag just yet.
What about the details?
Id rather do this face-to-face.
But you already knowwhat youre going to say.
I dont have to tell you
the obvious limitations of Sterling Cooper.
But youre going to.
Do I need to be careful here?
Its a mom-and-pop.
McCann Ericksonis an international company.
We have a network that extendsfar beyond Madison Avenue:
Europe, South America.
Were publicly traded.We issue dividends.
Small is bad.
Don,
do you know the kindof clients we attract?
Pan Am, Coca-Cola,
Esso.
Can you imagine the lifestyle
that goes with handling Pan Am?
Its a panty-dropper.
Television?
You could be in that in a bigger way.
You know that.
What, you want to sell corn?
We do a show about Indians.
Imagine yourselfin a three-year contract.
35 per annum, security set in stone.
Sterling probably hasntlet you break 30 yet.
No comment.
I really dont likedoing this over the phone.
All I can say iseventually you come up here,
or you die wondering.
He gave me his card right in front of Don.
Well, not right in front of him, I guess.
Well, I told Don about it.
I was a model, you know?
In fact, I met Don on a photo sh**t.
I was wearing this Russian blue fox coat.
He was just a copywriter at the fur company.
I remember
he saw that I didnt likegiving the coat back.
Its always the hardest part.
He asked me out.
He wasnt shy. I liked that.
I said no.
Then three weeks later,
the coat arrived at my apartment.
Who knows what kindof Indian trading
he had to do to get it?
I think I only hadtwo more jobs, maybe three,
before we got engaged.
And then I got pregnant.
Its always a nightmareraising children in Manhattan,
so we moved to Ossining.
Suddenly I...
really felt so old.
Tell me more about that.
My mother was very concernedabout looks and weight.
And Ive always eaten a lot.
And I like hot dogs.
Mother used to say,"Youre going to get stout. "
And then I became a model,and she hated it,
even though Suzy Parkermade $100,000 that year.
My mother hated it.
Manhattan.
She called me a prostitute.
Youre angry at your mother.
What?
Are you going to talk now?
You are angry at your mother.
Of all the things Ive said in here.
Youre sitting up.
You dont listen to me.
You dont listen to what I say,
and then out of nowhere you provoke me.
Tell me more about that.
I miss her.
I understand that.
Its good and bad.
She wanted me to be beautifulso I could find a man.
Theres nothing wrong with that.
But then what?
Just sit and... smoke and...
let it go till youre in a box?
I dont care why he gave me his card.
Whered you get this?
Kurt Teasdale over at Gil Bascom.
Its already on the air.
They wanted to do itbefore she had the baby.
Am I alone? I dont understand it.
Because its in Spanish.
I recognize that finishing school voice.
You cant govern and listen to that all day.
Im happy to give upany Spanish speakers
and hope this goes away.
Cooper thinks if Kennedy creeps upany more in the polls,
Nixon will panic,
and theyll get desperate for our efforts.
He wants everything in place.
More risk.
Why are we doing this again?And out of pocket?
I for one dont questionthe wishes of our clients.
Clients come and go, Campbell.
Sometimes its best to rid themof unrealistic expectations.
Are you trying to say that we cant win?
Nixons got an 8-point lead in the polls.
Not much.
And we still havent figured out a way
to make an impact aboutthe Nixon campaigns involvement.
My marching orderswere undecided states.
I think a plan of attackwould make Coop happy.
The 50/50s: Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois.
Now, its easy to just say that, isnt it?
I think women will hate her.
Its like their better-looking sistermarries a handsome senator,
and shes going to live in the White House.
Im practically jealous.
Hi.
I called.
I assumed you were staying in the city.
The girl.
We gave her a little extra work,and now shes distracted.
Look at that.
Its raw, Don.
Don, I realized something today.
I miss modeling.
You were alwaystelling me you hated it.
Maybe the passing of time
has made me... feel differently.
Maybe its Jim Hobart.
So what?
Its still an opportunity.
You want to go back to work?
A few days. I mean, is that so bad?
I get paid.
I can get Ethel to watch the kids.
She watches them half the time now.
Thats three-, four-hour stretches.
I think it would be funto go in and be that girl again.
Youre serious?
There will still be ham.
I promise.
Are you resolved?
Or is this even worth arguing?
No, its not like that.
Its just... something Id like to do.
Well, I cant stop youfrom doing what you want to do.
You have no ideahow boring it is around here.
Really? I would think one houron the Sterling Cooper switchboard
would be a Russian novel.
They told me it would happen,
but the truth isyou really just stop listening.
And put ice on your wrists.
Peggy, do you need to go home?
What?
The sweater.
Are you having one of those days?
Its not that.
Id like to go home,
but I just dont think I can.
Then what is it?
Youre not helping your silhouette.
I ripped my skirt.
You dont have a needle and thread?
Its a big rip.
Oh, honey, Ive gota spare outfit squirreled away.
You can borrow it.
Were not exactly dressedfor that, are we?
Ive lost men like you before.
It usually had to do withmy unexpressed confidence.
I think youre one in a million, Draper.
Those are nice clubs.
That bonus from Coopermust have made you happy.
It was designed as a kind of an armoragainst men like Jim Hobart.
Howd you hear about it?
I saw those clubsgoing down the hallway.
I thought they were for me.
Theyre from Jim Hobart.
What did he offer?
Bigger.
The world, basically.
Well, it cant just bea number on a salary,
because you know were open to that.
Pan Am.
Pan Am... is not McCann Erickson.
Big talent attracts big clients.
We can try and makethat happen here.
- Thats true.- But dont be fooled.
You hear Pan Am,you imagine London,
holed up at the Dorchesterwith three stewardesses.
The truth is its more likea 20-hour boomerang flight
so you can makea coupon sing in Spanish.
And when you have stockholderslike McCann does,
you cant fire clients.I know youll hate that.
I thought about leaving once.
But you know?
Its daunting.
Why entertain the prospect of failure?
Thats a sad thought.
No. It made me look at this place.
I dont want to sound sentimental,
but its not just accounts.
Look around here at what you have.
You want to start over?
I havent made up my mind.
Im taking this very personally.
Why? Its business.
Is it?
McCann Erickson is the major leagues.
Good. Let him go.
Youre right. Maybe hell take me with him.
Can you imagine the money?
I heard hes making 30 already.
Hes not ten times better than me.
You love him.
Everybody loves him.
Sure. His moods and the way he talks.
I dont even know what hessaying half the time.
Clients do.
Ill admit she crossed my mind once.
Shes having a very badfreshman year.
They went nuts for her writing.
Belle Jolie, she did that.
Belle Jolie was okay.
She obviously let it go to her head...and other parts of her.
No, I dont think its the job.
I think were seeing the real her:
One of those girlswho slimmed down before she got here.
Now shes here, and there she is.
Who thinks about her?
Maybe shell go with Draper, too.
Its a tragedy.
Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.
And no one ever got to eat it.
Well, I got some work to do.
Suddenly upon news of others success,a young man is filled with ambition.
Drop dead.
Harry, you busy?
Well, hello. I cant believe this.
Im sorry. I, uh, overdid it.
Youre out of the businessa few years, and things change.
Please, Im overwhelmedwith the style of you.
Betty Draper, meet Ronnie Gittridge.
He handles the art for Coca-Cola.
Hes also my brother-in-law.
It is a pleasure.
Look at her. What did I say?
You ready to work?
Im excited.
Its not that complicated.
Hes either going to tell youto think about something else
or just stand there.
Jim thinks everyone elses job is easy.
Shall we?
Mrs. Draper,
its just a tryout.
No guarantees.
I told you Ive done this before.
Now, where did you get that dress?
So basically,
whereas Secor previouslyspent their money
on local print and radio,
we increase the network buy to 30%.
More points for each dollar.
Secor laxatives.
You know, I have to talkto those people.
Theyre not what you would expect.
They have absolutelyno sense of humor about their product.
Who knew that collegewas going to get me out of the army
and into laxatives?
College was the moment, wasnt it?
Fun and games... and girls.
Were you in a frat?
Alpha Delta Phi.
Also known as cutups.
We were the cutups.
We had this stray Dalmatian.
Our mascot Mamie.
So it died,
and in classic fraternity manner,we decided to throw a party.
Mamies funeral.
One of the pledges pipes inthat our rivals, Psi U...
They are so g*n.
Psi U is throwing a beauty pageant paradeon Main Street
with the girls school down the road.
Now, my friend Chip...hes a lawyer now...
says "Why dont we go down thereand get a permit,
throw a grand funeral for Mamie,and let the girls run away crying?"
Thats great. Did you do it?
We had police barricadesand 30 brothers following that pledge,
who had the honor of pullingMamie in a Radio Flyer.
Thats beautiful.
Idiots.
Wait a minute.
Nixon and Kennedyare both buying up air time
in these undecided states.
Its an arms race.
Nixon buys, Kennedy matches.
So if we cant increaseNixons presence,
we can decrease Kennedys.
How do we do that?
We make big buys in New Jersey,Illinois, and wherever
for Secor laxatives.
Well, hold on.
So Nixons selling laxatives?
No. Were selling laxatives.
Nixons selling Nixon.
And Kennedyswatching Mamies funeral.
This is scary.
It is.
Isnt it?
Even careful mothers cant completely
protect their familiesfrom household germs
just by cleaning alone.
Thats why you need Lysol.
Lysol, added to yourregular cleaning water,
eliminates germs that cause odors
that may cause illness.
Lysol: Fastest, easiest,
most effective wayto k*ll household germs...
It was for me.
...and lingering odors.
Who was it?
Im the girl. The girl with the cola.
Its only a couple days work.
You know, just a couple of photo sh**tand then some kind of testing.
But I guess you know how it works.
I do.
Dont worry.Im not going to ruin this.
Im very happy for you.
I know you dont like it.
But I know yourea little bit proud of me.
Come upstairs.
No.
Right here.
Okay.
How are these open already?
Well, Betty, we dont want lifeto look difficult, now do we?
Youre too much.
No! No!
Polly, no!


Let it go.
If I see that dog in my yard again,
Im going to sh**t it.
I see you got there and back in one piece.
Yes.
And even though I got lost,
I sent Ethel home at 4.
They went to the park,then to visit Ernie at Francines.
All in all, everyone had a nice day.
So how was it?
There was this man Ronnie.
I dont even know what his job is.
Ronnie Gittridge.Hes the art director. Ive met him.
He is such a character.
He tells funny stories.
I brought the form home.
I thought you couldhelp me fill it out
so I can get paid.
Id love to.
Sweetie pie.
What happened?
I had a bad dream.
Get in bed with Daddy.
What was your dream?
I dont want anyone to sh**t Polly.
No one is going to do that, honey.
Yes. Mr. Brestwood said he would
because Polly ate one of his doves.
Theyre pigeons.
And he said this to you in your dream?
No, he said it todaywhen Polly ate the birdie.
She wasnt hurt that bad.She could fly.
No one is going to hurt Polly.
Good night, honey.
Now they cant play in the yard?
Im going to get my robe on
and go over thereand find out what happened.
2 in the morning.
Hes our neighbor. Youll make it worse.
Ill talk to him.
You should have Ethel talk to him.
Don, they play in the yardwhen Im here, too.
And she didnt tell you?
Im sure they didnt tell her.
They probably wouldnthave told me, either.
Therell be over at Francinesfor the next sh**t anyway.
Its one day.
Im sure it wasnt that bad.
Maybe not.
Shed never slept well.
Thats not true.
Did you see those big tears?
I really want to get a pictureof her crying one day.
I have to say, Don,
Lucky Strike, even in this lawsuit,is stronger than ever.
It was a brilliant campaign,
like some supersonic jetflying right over the market.
I was there.Great work.
Thank you.
Sorry to interrupt.Who is responsible?
Weve made a significant commitment
for as-yet unproducedSecor laxative commercials.
This didnt go by me.
No, it went by Bob Wilkinsin Media, right to me.
Who is responsible?
Mr. Cooper, sir, it was me.
You thought of this?
Well, uh...
I bear some of the responsibility as well.
What did they do?
Every commercial block on airin the Land of Lincoln
is clogged up with laxative buys.
And a little bit of Nixon time.
The Kennedy people wont knowwhat to do with themselves.
Theyre going to haveto put his pretty face on the radio.
And with that accent.
Nicely done.
I didnt think you had it in you,and I mean that.
- Thank you.- Thank you.
Inspired.
Congratulations, boys.
Peggy, you want to write that down?
Don said congratulations.
Are we done here?
No.
I really thought
it was going to go bad for a minute.
I was sure it would.
No kidding.You almost let me detonate
a thousand feet from the ground.
So much for camaraderie.
Mr. Rumsen sent this over.
Unopened. Very nice.
Hildy, stay. Have a drink. Its an order.
No, thank you.
Im going to my parents after work.
You know, when somethinggood happens to me,
it also happens to you.
I know that.
I said congratulations.
You should do somethingwith that sour puss.
Youre very beautiful.
Just being honest.
I love watching you walk.
I should go.
You should.
Is he in?
Always nice to see you.
Id give you my assurance
that nothing good will happen to that boy,
but I cant seemto keep my word on that,
hard as I try.
I might ask you to take me with you.
I see no reason to leave.
Or maybe I see a million.
A million? Is thatwhat its going to cost me?
I was thinking more like 40.
45 is good.
Im not going to be a little girland ask you why you stayed.
I know its not money,
and I hope its not to keepyour foot on Pete Campbell.
I like the way you do business.
Well, I try to beas civilized as you can be.
No contract.
45 and no security.
Whats in it for me?
If I leave this place one day,it will not be for more advertising.
What else is there?
I dont know. Life being lived.
Id like to stop talking about itand get back to it.
Ive worked with a lot of men like you,
and if you had to choose a place to die,it would be in the middle of a pitch.
Ive done that.
I want to do something else.
Jim Hobart, McCann Erickson.
Of course.
Line 1.
Don,
incredible pictures, am I wrong?
No, youre not.
So, your wifes already here with us.
I know shes happy.
Why dont you join her?
I dont know about that, Jim.
You can do better than that.
You know what Im offering here?
Its Yankee Stadium. I know.
What, did Sterling come to the rescue?
If this is about money,
I have to say I mighthave judged you wrong.
Its not.
Im surprised.
I thought your wife coming heremeant you were interested.
No, that was her idea.
Cant blame me for trying.
Maybe not, but, uh...
I cant exactly saythat was a big league move.
Alls fair. No stone unturned, right?
Its a pity to lose both of you.
Youre a very lucky man,landing that woman.
Whats going on with Mr. Draper?
Even if I knew, I wouldnt tell you.
Very good.
Ive been meaningto give this back to you.
I had it completely dry cleaned.
Why dont you keep it?
Have it taken in here and let out there.
Its your dress.
Hot tea. Thats a good idea.
What are you talking about?
Peggy, you are falling preyto a very common situation for new girls.
Im not new anymore.
Well, thats just it.
Dont you want to do well here?
Im the first girl to do any writingin this office since the w*r.
Marge told me.
Writing?
Is that what this is about?
I thought you were doing thatto get close to Paul.
Thank you. Again.
I heard you were beingconsidered for an account
because a clients wife saw you
and thought it would be okayif he worked with you.
You know, youre not a stick.
And yet I never wonderwhat men think of me.
Youre hiding a very attractive young girlwith too much lunch.
I know what men think of you:
That youre looking for a husband,and youre fun,
and not in that order.
Peggy, this isnt China.
Theres no money in virginity.
Im not a virgin.
No. Of course not.
I just realized something.
You think youre being helpful.
Well, I am trying, dear.
Im going home.
Did you have a good day?
I did. It was splendid.
Well, Betty, I have some good newsand some bad news.
Theres bad news?
The clients movingthe international work to London.
Oh.
More Audrey Hepburn, less Grace Kelly.
I see.
As for us,
were all going back to the malt shop.
The good news is you have twowonderful sets of pictures
to start your book again.
Thats true.
I really am sorry.
This was fun.
You can keep the dressand the hairstyle.
I dont do that for everyone.
Oh, honey,
it has nothing to do with you.
Thank you.
What do you think, Paul?
Should we move this whole thing
down to MacDougal Street?
Were doing great here.
Its good she left.
It probably wasntgoing to happen for her tonight.
It depends how much we drink.
How drunk do you have to be?
My brother works at the Exchange.
They call a girl like her a lobster.
All the meats in the tail.
Are they giving you guys a bonus?
Would you calm down?
Come on!
Drop you at the station?
Sure.
Campbell, you sucker-punched me.
What is wrong with you?
Come on.
You just had a fight,
and I was not part of it.
Either you two make up,or I do not stand a chance tonight.
Perfect timing.
The children are down,
but only because they wererunning around all day.
They fell asleep in front of the TV.
How did it go today?
Good. Fun.
They were talking about a whole stringof other possibilities for me.
But honestly,I dont think I want to work anymore.
I dont like you coming home to some...whipped-together mess
of whatevers left in the fridge.
And frankly, I dont likeManhattan on my own.
Its harsh.
It can be.
And what am I going to do?
Run around the city with my book,
like some teenager,making a fool of myself?
If thats what you want,
and its my jobto give you what you want.
You do.
Look at all this.
I dont know what I was thinking.
Birdie, you know I dont care
about making my dinneror... taking in my shirts.
You have a job.
Youre mother to those two little people,
and you are better at itthan anyone else in the world.
At least in the top 500.
I would have given anythingto have had a mother like you.
Beautiful and kind...
filled with love like an angel.
Youre sweet.
And this does not taste whipped-up.
No. Its good, isnt it?
Have a good day, Daddy.
You, too.
Have a good day.
Were going to the community centerto watch them fill the pool.
That sounds fun.
Have a good day.
I already am.
Mommy, Im eating.
Be careful.Dont jump off the bed.
Okay!
Mrs. Draper,what the hell are you doing?
Mrs. Draper!
