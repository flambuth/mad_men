Ooh.
Burger Chefs mascotLittle Chef is a flop
because hes, what,another chef?
He doesnt eat the burgers,he cooks them.
But what if you replaced himwith a fresh recruit?
A saucy little retard named Scout.
He cant workat a hamburger stand.
He can take anythingbut an order.
Hey, Don.
Stan, once the smoke clears,
I need you to rush some things outfor Handi-Wrap.
- I need it by 4:00.- Mmm.
Im really, truly busy.
What the hell is that?
Turns out Lou thinkshes Mort Drucker.
- Mort Walker.- Howd you get this?
It wasnt our fault.Why is Scout always up to no good?
He peeled a bag of grapefruits.
Thought they were potatoes.
Im gonna get rid of this.
He left it on the Xerox.He obviously wanted us to have a copy.
Youre just gonna force meto draw my own.
Ive got a plane to catch.Get to work.
Dons still part of the faculty.
Naw, hes gonna stroketo em later.
Why dont you let Loretta do that?
She can handle the homework.Ill handle the silver.
Whatd you land on?
Rumaki, Crab Louieon toast points,
and little franksin barbecue sauce.
You know theyve gotfour more houses to visit after us?
I wanted to go firstto put everyone at ease.
They get so tongue-tiedaround us.
They can only pretend so longwere just regular neighbors.
Could you stock the bar?
Hi. Did you haveany trouble finding us?
No.
Im Megan, by the way.
Im Stephanie.
You are so beautiful.
I know, Im a Madonna.
But you are truly magnetic.
What do you do?
Don didnt tell you?Im an actress.
Uh, welcome.
Im grateful.
For some reason,Im not crying, man.
Well, why dont I fix yousomething to eat
and then you can takea shower if you want?
- Is it that bad?- No!
I dont know.
I think youd want to relax.
Don didnt say much aboutyour situation other than the obvious.
Your place is out of sight.
Im at a flop in MacArthur Park,
but Im headed up to Oaklandwith a little help.
I have some friends thereand one of thems old mans a doctor.
So, assume its no trouble at all.
Whats your pleasure?Grilled cheese? Spaghetti?
Do you have any meat?Ive been dreaming about it.
Sure.
Now you go into the bedroomback there.
I changed the sheets.There are towels.
You can lie down, run a bath,whatever you want.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you.Im pretty b*at.
You know I want her.
You cant have her.
Why cant I have her?
Because Scouts on er.
Nice of you to join us.
Don, why dont you take the mound,throw out the first pitch?
Sure.
Stan has somevery preliminary work.
Stan?
Should I move over thereor do you want to come over here?
I dont know, Stan.Can you be smug from over there?
Lou, I dont knowwhat you think you heard.
I heard everything!
From your first fartto your last dying breath.
You think its funny?
I apologize deeply.
What happened?
Let me ask you, Peggy.
- You ever heard of Underdog?- The cartoon?
Yeah.Sweet Polly Purebred.
Saturday morning.
It makes hundreds of thousandsof dollars a year.
Mostly for its creator Chet Stoverof Dancer Fitzgerald.
- Did you know him there?- He was nothing special.
"Scouts Honor"is 100 times better.
I can tell you right now,its a winner.
You know who had a ridiculous dreamand people laughed at him?
You?
What?
Oh, I did not mean thatthe way it sounded.
I mean, if youre telling usthat this is your dream,
I apologize for beingone of those naysaying idiots.
I hate people like that.
Bob Dylan.
Is he hip enough for you?
He was 20 years oldwhen he wrote "Blowin in the Wind"
and hes a genius.
Look at where he is,look at where you are.
You know what?
Youre a bunchof flag-burning snots.
Youve got a thing to learnabout patriotism and loyalty.
The very fabric of "Scouts Honor"is a joke to you.
Were gonna havethis meeting later.
So order dinnerbecause I want finished work.
And if any of you dont like it,
you can thankyour hilarious friends here.
Last flights at 9:00.Put me on that.
- Ill cancel my plans.- Just mine, not yours.
I dont know if its vandalsor just kids being kids.
What is it?
Someone broke all the streetlightson Peck Avenue.
And you want Henryto get them fixed?
No. Mike was just sayingits a national disease.
The wildness of the kids.
I just dont expect itin Westchester.
I know all everyone wantsto talk about is Vietnam,
but things arefalling apart here, too.
The rumaki is exquisite.
Thank you.
Well, I dont knowthat those things are unrelated.
I mean, first the kidsstart off protesting
and the next thing you knowevery authority is up for grabs.
I mean, if they learnedhow to support their country,
sacrifice in hard times,wed have the morale to win the w*r.
Mike, you have plansfor summer?
Even Nixon wants to bringthe w*r to an end.
Im surprised, Henry.
Dont be, Mike.I agree with Nixon.
I think its too costly.
It has to be cloneon the right terms,
but I think we should get outwhile the gettings good.
Since when?
Ive always supportedthe president, honey.
I think that maybe everyoneshould fill up here.
I dont knowif my lamb turned out.
Im sure its delicious.
Let me check the Sterno.
Well, I think I workedevery side of the strategy.
Don, youve been the boss.
The briefcase and the hat,thats a rookie maneuver.
You got someplace to be?
Im afraid I do.
Hows it going to look for themif I let you go?
Well, you could let everybody go.
Is that what you would do?
No, Id let you go, Lou.
Well, Im afraidits too late for that.
Im gonna do you the courtesyof reading these
so that you can continue to work on theminstead of coming up with new things,
because Im gonnatuck you in tonight.
About your cartoon.
Here we go.
This is an office made out of peoplewho have problems with authority.
You know you have to havea thick skin, but dont help them.
Im not taking management advicefrom Don Draper.
Hello?
I cant get out of here tonight.
Oh, Im sorry.
- Is she there yet?- Shes taking a bath.
How is she?
Shes pretty far along.
So beautiful.
Well, dont bother her.Tell her Ill see her in the morning.
Dont worry.I made her a steak.
Thank you.
Okay, Ill see youtomorrow morning.
Okay.
Damn, that smells good.
Dons stuck in New York.Hes flying in tomorrow morning.
Was that him?
Yeah, hes frustrated.I told him not to worry.
Wait, do you want to eat outside?
I do that all the time.
I love that youre wearingAnnas ring.
Oh, yes.Its beautiful.
Im sorry I never met her.
Shes around.Believe me, youve met her.
Shes happy its in the family.
Well, maybe youll havesomeone there to give it to.
Oh, no.Its yours now.
Youll probably havesomeone of your own.
Well see.I dont know.
Dons kids are plenty for me.
I havent eaten meat in a year.
I dont think this is a good idea.
I can make spaghetti.
Its probably hardwith you here and him there.
Are you with someone?
Not right now.He was a musician.
Theyre the worst.
Dropped out of school.Followed him down here.
Started flush at the beach,
ended up downtown panhandling.
And then he got busteddealing grass
and we celebratedbefore he went away.
Hell be out in a month.
So will this little guy.
- Does he know?- No.
Im afraid hed m*rder someonejust to stay in jail.
- I wont tell Don.- Oh, I dont care.
I know all of his secrets.
But you dont know himvery well.
Youre right.Youre right.
Its just Im looking at you
and seeing how, well,disorganized this all is.
And I dont thinkhed stand for that.
I dont think hed trust youto make your own plans.
I dont know what Im doing here.This was a dumb idea.
No, no, I mean, he wants to help,Im sure, in his way.
We both do.
Im going to give you."
would $1,000get you far enough?
Thats very generous.
This comes with no strings.
Thank you.
I really think its better this way.
Youre right.Im gonna take off.
You havent eaten anything yet.
I guess I got what I came for.
Theres no rush.
Nothing ever happenedbetween us, you know.
Of course not.
Youre his niece.I know that.
The children are asleep.
- What about your headache?- Keep your voice down.
I did not appreciategoing stag
to four peoples homeswhom I barely know.
Im sorry.I wasnt feeling well.
You didnt have to go.
Hey, Emily Post, why were youtalking about the w*r?
I didnt bring it up.
But maybe I should morebecause I didnt know where you stood.
I shouldnt have to brief you
because you shouldnt betalking about those things.
Im not a dinner companion.Im their elected representative.
- You ran unopposed.- Well see if that lasts.
From now on, keep your conversationto how much you hate
getting toast crumbs in the butterand leave the thinking to me!
Henry!
Im sorry.It just caught me off-guard.
Well, you embarrassed yourselfway more than me.
You know what?
I decided I can see that Monday.
Good night.

Hello?
Oh, hi.
- Who are you?- Im Amy.
- We met on the phone.- ls Megan here?
Oh, Don.I...
Amy, do you mind?
Ill just use the ladies.
Im sorry, but she left.
You told her I wanted to see her?
I really tried to get her to stay.
But the money already came upand I gave her $1,000.
She must have beenembarrassed.
She said shed call youfrom Oakland.
You should have called me.At least let me talk to her.
Shes an adult, Don.
Do you want to goto the market with us?
You know, Im gonna havecompany tonight.
Maybe itll cheer you up.
Well go.Amy.
- Is everything okay?- Yes.
- We should go.- Anything for you, Don?
I know what he likes.
Ahem.

- Let me see.- Shes fine.
Couple of black eyes.

You cant be trusted on your own.Thats your face, young lady.
Thats right, its my face.
- Why am I even here?- Girls! Girls! Please.
Sally, you can understand
how your mother and I are bothworried about your nose.
Yeah, I know, because where wouldMom be without her perfect nose?
She wouldnt finda man like you.
Shed be nothing.
It was a perfect nose.
And I gave it to you!
Youre lucky Henryis important enough
to get Dr. Kramerto fix it this weekend.
I suppose youd rather do itin a barn in Farmington.
Its a nose job,not an ab*rtion.
- Im going to break your arm next.- Betty!
Dont worry about mefinding a man.
I already have youto keep me in line.
Youre going to your room and youregoing to wait there until morning.

I just drove to White Plainsand back up to Farmington.
I dont want to sitin the kitchen like the help.
"The help"?
Im going to assumeyoure not referring to me.
Whats gotten into you?
You come in and ask me to movejust because you feel like moving.
Im comfortable in hereor I wouldnt be sitting in here!
Knock it off.
Im tired of everyonetelling me to shut up.
Im not stupid.
I speak Italian.
Im sorry I embarrassed you.
Youre sorry you forgot to inform mewhat I am supposed to think.
Guess what.I think all by myself.
Youre so smart.Why dont you run for office?
You know what, Henry?
I dont know what Im going to do,but thats a good idea.
Good morning, Michael.
How are you?
Cant you tell?Im myself again.
Oh, good.Glad to hear that.
But I do want to sayin the clearness of day,
I have feelings for you.
Well, Im flattered.
And that happenswhen you work with people,
but its not real.
I realized it was the waves of data.
They were filling me up.I had to find the release.
I removed the pressure.
Now it just flows through mewithout affecting me at all.
It has an outlet.Open it.
You dont haveto thank me for that.
Its obviously somethingyou did on your own.
What is that?
Its my nipple.Its the valve.
Its weird-- theyll sew it up,but they wont take it off.
I had to do that myself.
Anyway, Im grateful,so I wanted to show it.
Michael, sit down.
I want you to wait here.
Did Mr. Ginsberg find you?
"Savoy" playing
Jim, Lou.Sorry to interrupt.
You must be Les.Don Draper.
Don.
This is Stephen and Tony.
We werent expecting you, Don.
I know that and I apologize.
I just wanted to saysomething that I think
these gentlemen from Philip Morrisare too polite to say.
We know who you are
and were only talkingabout a presentation right now.
But we do have a problemworking with the man
who cut our throatin "The New York Times."
Well, if you wereto give us a sh*t,
Im preparedto leave the agency.
Don, thanks for saying thatso that we dont have to.
Just know the manthat wrote that letter
was trying to save his business,not destroy yours.
Like Lou, I have over 10 yearsof tobacco experience.
Since my first dayon Lucky Strike,
the governmentwas building a scaffold
for your whole industry.
And I found a way to staythat execution
in 60, 62, 64, and 65.
Im also the only cigarette manwho sat down with the opposition.
They sharedtheir strategy with me
and I know how to b*at it.
That may be true,
but we dont turn on our friendsas easily as you do.
I just keep thinkingwhat your friends
at American Tobacco would thinkif you made me apologize.
Force me into your service.
They are still your competition,arent they?
Gentlemen, thank youfor your time.
Get out while you can!
Im gonna ride down with him.
Youre incredible.
Thank you.
You think this is goingto save you, dont you?
