Previously on Mad Men...
He is not your friend, he is the enemy.
You let Don talk, you should know better.
The guy's not a salesman.
- Why do we care what that guy wants? - Because he's a client.
I don't want to live on the Upper East side.
I saw us raising our kids in a place with more different kinds of people.
I don't know what to say.
Say you're gonna be the first American to complete a successful heart transplant.
I could come up and stay there tonight, if you want.
We'll be fine.
Are you sure you don't want me to order in some food?
- Chinese? - I'm sorry this is taking so long.
It's a common mistake to not ask questions
when you want something because you're afraid of the answers.
So you want something?
I'm interested.
And considering the precedent for small agencies,
this is how we might take you public.
With one and a half million shares outstanding
before the offering, we'd sell 400,000 additional shares
to the public at $9 a share.
- 12 a share. - It's not an insult.
Our valuation of your company was made after careful analysis.
Of papers you spent 20 minutes with?
I can't take this to the rest of my partners,
but I can take it to other underwriters.
I'll need these documents for 24 hours.
These papers are spotless. My compliments to the chef.
Shall we?
You don't think Cooper pushed that poor banker too hard, do you?
We don't want to lose him.
Certainly not.
It's a marvel.
Everyone wants you, don't they?
Pete, no.
No, I believe our primary hurdle has been cleared.
And our secondary one?
Don't worry about Don. Even at nine a share,
your part of the company alone will be worth nearly $1 million.
My goodness.
You're flushed.
I drank too fast.
I don't think Don cares about money.
That may be true. God bless him.
But he's tired of playing in the bush leagues.
This capitalization will double our size
and that will turn his head.
You want another?
No. I can hardly walk and you know it.
I hope Clara reminded you tomorrow's Mother's Day.
Thank you, I'm aware.
Ow.
Just wanted to make sure you were still here.
I am, but not for long.
You don't even know what time it is.
I do.
Because I already got up and put on my face.
Is that what you do?
- I wondered. - I have to go.
Daisy, you're a tease.
What more could I give you?
Look, the first-class lounge would be a darker place without you,
but you're supposed to have your ear to the ground.
I feel like you only call me when you want to see me.
Am I going to see you tomorrow?
If there's a flight filled with P&G executives headed back to Cincinnati.
- How about tonight? - I have plans.
Some other boyfriend? The one you give all the leads to?
With my mother.
It's Mother's Day.
Don't go.
I have to.
But my mother just died.
What are you doing?
You told me you wanted me here Sunday morning.
I'm here.
Peter, don't.
So we'll just maintain every other aspect of this marriage
except the one that matters.
You mean Tammy?
Will you stop holding the axe over my neck?
So you'd rather I divorce you just so you know where things stand?
You don't care that I want you.
I've taken note of your efforts.
I'm going to get her.
Well...
you're gonna be sorry when this is over.
You've given up on me at exactly the wrong time.
I have big things coming.
You have no idea.
Well, I'll take note of that, too.
_
_
_
_
_
_
_
Could you get that?
- Arnold. Come in. - Hi.
I'm sorry to bother you. Do you have any wrapping paper?
It's an emergency.
Good morning.
Sorry, this is Megan's mother Marie.
We passed in the lobby. I thought you were Megan.
Dr. Arnold Rosen at your service.
- Enchanté. - Are you French?
My kid's going to Paris. Should I keep him home?
I am French, but I live in Montreal.
And, yes, I believe so.
I assume this isn't a medical emergency.
Mitchell-- that's my son--
he came home and surprised her for Mother's Day.
- How long is he staying? - Who knows?
I know he thinks a morning stroll in Central Park is a gift,
but Sylvia's gonna expect an actual gift.
Do you want my flowers? I'm quite done with them.
Thank you, Mother.
You're a lifesaver.
He's a surgeon. He's working on heart transplants.
Wealthy, talented, handsome--
I would not leave them alone.
I'm more worried about you.
There's poop on the stairs again.
Somebody's dog got in.
No, it's human.
I think it's from the tenant.
She wouldn't do that.
She's a junkie. She doesn't care.
I want her out.
We can't do that.
How is your mother?
I got curtains. She wants to come visit.
Ah! Ow! Ow.
Jesus.
We have to hire a handyman.
Why? It's a waste of money.
Because you have no idea what you're doing.
Herb Rennet called. He's canceling dinner tonight.
That's a relief.
We can still have dinner.
I'd love to discuss some things with you.
Let's enjoy our reprieve.
Of course.
Psst. Close the door.
Did he say your dinner with Jaguar is off?
Yes, unless it was the world's most boring dream.
Well, it's on, but Pete's not invited.
Herb Rennet wants a word alone to straighten things out.
Why can't you handle it?
This could be fatal. You're going.
And my plan is to pack it with spouses to limit the expl*si*n.
Megan made plans with her mother.
She thought I had a business dinner.
Marie's in town? Fantastic.
Bring her along. That's perfect.
Tell her I insisted.
In attendance I have Jim Cutler,
Frank Gleason, and Ted Chaough.
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting. What are you doing?
It's for the purposes of the memorandum.
Well, Ted, some men love women, some love memos.
I want to go over where we are on Chevrolet again
and devote our final days to overdoing it
on the artwork for the top three campaigns.
I cannot look at these again.
I told you, they're very keen on the rocket ship thing
with the astronaut anecdotes.
You told them about the astronauts?
I had to. It was too vague otherwise.
I don't want to draw any more rockets
and I don't want to stare at this work again.
We should have never resigned Alfa Romeo.
What, is this mystery Chevy gonna be in "The Graduate"?
Those things are flying off the lot.
Frank, are you not on board with this?
I love what you're doing.
I'm tired of rockets, that's all.
Could you give us a moment? We'll continue this later.
What is that, Shalimar?
What's gotten into you?
You're supposed to be calming me down.
Ted, I've got cancer.
What?
In my pancreas.
I told Jim. I thought he told you
and you didn't want to embarrass me.
No.
Maybe it's more of a financial issue to him,
but I'm glad he can keep a secret.
Financial?
The minute I cash out, I cash in.
You two have to buy me out.
You have cancer.
See, if we still had Alfa, I wouldn't have to worry
about putting you out of business.
First of all,
stop talking about money.
Second, we are going to get Chevy
because you're going to do your best work.
Third, you're going to build a wing
at Sloan-Kettering and b*at this thing.
Aye, aye.
Will you tell Jim you told me?
He'll see it on your face.
Everybody loves astronauts.
I've got to go lie down.
Well, hello there.
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Hello. Can you hear me?
I love it when you whisper like that. What are you wearing?
My uniform.
I have one and his flight's delayed.
Who is he? What's he do?
I'm not sure,
but he doesn't believe my name's really Daisy.
Use that.
Shit.
Do you mind?
17, please.
I'm sorry to bother you, but we love your show.
Oh, thank you.
Can we get an autograph?
I know you're not waving to me.
Makes the delay worthwhile, doesn't it?
- Headed to Detroit? - Eventually.
Should we try LaGuardia?
They already did. Forget it.
This is why I like to drive everywhere.
I'd live in my car if I could.
You know, with her in the backseat navigating.
I'm Roger.
- What's your name? - Mikey.
Well, Mikey, since we're gonna be cell mates,
I'm going to ask the screw for a couple of drinks.
Jim Beam.
I'll make her bring them over.
- Good idea. - I'm full of 'em.
I want a glass of water with an onion
and bring him a double Jim Beam.
And get me on that flight.
_
This is my day off. We had plans.
_
_
Well, you would rather spend the evening laughing at Roger Sterling's jokes.
I should return home. I've overstayed my welcome.
_
_
_
_
Well, I don't know what's happened.
I knew something was wrong.
We have not had a fight.
He's so far away
that sometimes when we're alone,
I feel like I'm making conversation.
Darling, you have confounded everyone's expectations.
And it is very hard to stand next to someone
giving an autograph.
- He doesn't even care. - Of course he does.
But he may think you belong more to other people than to him.
_
_
_
_
_
I love coming into the city.
It's 25 minutes, half hour give or take,
from Tenafly depending on the traffic.
I always think I'm gonna go to museums and stuff.
And there's some good ones. You've probably seen them.
But I always end up at Saks.
And I come home
and Herb always says the same thing.
How much damage did you do, Peaches?
We always do some shopping.
My daughter is very generous.
She even invited me along to this wonderful evening.
You get a hold of Silver Bells?
No. That doesn't mean he's not coming.
I'm pretty much done waiting.
Perhaps we should go.
What?
No, I think we're gonna order now.
Herb gets very peckish.
I skipped lunch.
Can I help you, Bert?
You've already done all you can do.
Snapped this place into shape,
expanded our business while keeping it lean.
Pending due diligence, we're done...
at $11 a share.
Really?
I believe I would like a drink.
What do you drink?
Do you have any brandy?
No.
Spirits of elderflower?
No. I don't have any laudanum either.
- Surprise me. - Night, chief.
Bob, could you get Joan?
- And some ice. - Absolutely.
When do we break the news?
Call the meeting for tomorrow.
Ahh.
So there she was in the garage
right among the-- you know, there's an oil stain
that Herb's been meaning to take care of--
there she is, our little puppy,
with a full litter.
_
_
_
You're right, Mother. They must have been adorable.
There's one yellow and one brown
and then three sort of mixed.
Each one at its own nipple.
I love puppies.
Not the way she does.
_
You know what? Why don't we let the men
discuss the business they're probably here to talk about
while we powder our noses?
Tall and tan and young and lovely.
So why are we here, Herb?
Oh, it's nothing serious. I just had an idea.
There's a kid who's been writing fliers for me
at a few of my lots
and I'm really getting results.
He's got a good turn of phrase.
I think you'd appreciate it.
Is he looking for a job?
No, he's got a job.
I just thought that it might help you and me
if he were to take a look at some of your work,
even at the formative stages,
just to get his take on it.
What's his name?
Fawcett.
Chris Fawcett.
Here you go.
- What is this? - It's the name of the guy
who's going to be handling your account from now on.
You never fail to overheat, do you?
You know the somersaults I'm doing 'cause you're so touchy?
Really? A man your size?
You know what?
Your whole company should be taken to the woodshed.
First Campbell gives me the sass.
Then Sterling, he didn't even show up.
And you-- huh, yeah-- my friend,
you're gonna be working for him.
And he could teach you something
like knowing where your bread is buttered.
Why don't you get this?
I want you to buy me one last meal.
I'm tired of taking it out of your account.
Okay.
And if you ever see Sterling again,
tell him you screwed up
'cause I'm done with all of youse.
Don't sit down. Dinner's over.
Are you okay?
Never felt better in my life.
Nice meeting you. See you soon.
My mother needs an aspirin.
I don't care.
- Hello? - Marie.
It's Roger. I'm so glad I got you.
If you are calling to apologize, don't bother.
- It's too late. Good night. - Hold on, hold on, don't hang up.
- Let me talk to Don. - Did you call to talk to Don?
Yes, but I was hoping you were there. You were next, I swear.
You dragged me out and made me sit
with that disgusting man with his disgusting wife.
She is the apple that goes in the pig's mouth.
Marie, I swear I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
It's just something came up,
something very important
that I need to talk to Don about.
You are speaking slowly so I will understand?
Forget... my... name.
Excuse me.
Is it possible for me to pay for my friend?
Yes, but it's too late for that.
What are you bugging him for?
Aren't I enough for you?
This is my friend. What was your fake name again?
Curious George?
You're a riot.
Hello.
Good night.
Isn't that guy a client?
Is he gone?
Yes.
I have a high-level accounts question.
A hypothetical.
So it doesn't involve anybody in this room?
Let's say you caught your father-in-law in a compromising position.
It's every Sunday night. The guy can't hold his liquor.
Last night I was celebrating at that party house up on Lex
and I saw my father-in-law exit the bedroom
with the biggest,
blackest prostitute you've ever seen.
Was there anyone else from Vicks there?
Not that I saw. But we spoke.
I mean, all I said was hello, but--
Okay, look, when I was in high school,
they had this picture come to the only movie theater in Cabot.
It was called "Making A Baby."
They invited women and men separately,
but it was a delivery system for some filthy stuff.
So at the matinee, I look over
and Mr. Miller my science teacher is five seats away.
And he's not, you know, working the slide rule or anything,
but we see each other for sure.
But we both knew that neither of us should be there.
It was mutually assured destruction.
So he's not going to say anything?
He can't.
Mr. Cosgrove, I have a phone call.
Give me a second.
It's why I don't worry about the b*mb.
It's urgent.
I have Hugh Hibbert and John Echolls from Jaguar.
Why are they calling you? Pick it up.
This is Ken.
Good morning.
Do you have any idea where Roger has been for the last 24 hours?
- I don't. - Draper!
What in the hell have you--
- What? - You have done it again.
What did you say to Herb Rennet last night?
Nothing that shouldn't have been said last Christmas.
As usual, you have acted impulsively
and harmed the company irreparably.
- Pete, calm down. - We'd already lost the account.
He was gonna bring in some kid to write copy.
That's because you screwed him last time.
You couldn't wait.
Pete, you've got to understand when it's over.
Do you know that we had a public offering underway?
And now it's ruined!
- What? - You don't care about the company.
- You're already rich. - Not here.
Inside.
- What is going on? - Why the hell didn't I know about this?
- We're going public? - Not anymore.
- When did that happen? - I was going to tell you this morning.
I tried to last night, but you'd rather have dinner with Herb Rennet.
Well, I have some good news and some bad news.
- Where the hell have you been? - Don fired Jaguar.
What?
Then I just have good news. We're giving a presentation
this Friday on Chevy's top secret new car.
- What? - Friday?
Come on, you've been thinking about Chevy your whole life.
- Are you serious? - And I have this check for $10,000
because I close, Pete. I close things.
Did I mention I was in Detroit
where my friend Mikey O'Brien-- look him up--
said he was looking for something cutting-edge,
but none of the agencies had it?
So he had a great idea. Bring us in.
We're not afraid of a deadline.
Holy crap. Chevy.
You want to go public?
How much better is it when we have Chevy?
Don't act like you had a plan.
You're Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.
Roger, I want to know everything. Pete, go box up Jaguar.
Make sure they have all their files today.
Joan, get the creatives in my office.
Get them yourself.
Don't you feel 300 pounds lighter?
I don't.
Honestly, Don, if I could deal with him, you could deal with him.
And what now?
I went through all of that for nothing?
Joan, don't worry. I will win this.
Just once
I would like to hear you use the word "we."
Because we're all rooting for you from the sidelines,
hoping that you'll decide whatever you think is right for our lives.
In my office, all of you.
Should we go in there?
I don't care.
XP-887.
- So we get to name it? - Possibly.
For now it's all cloak-and-dagger.
They've got a room full of R&D on this.
But it boils down to Chevrolet's top brass
trying to build the perfect car.
- They designed it with a computer. - So they're scared.
They run another agency in at the one-yard line.
They're terrified.
So who else is in it?
Well, the guest list limping in
is as follows-- Campbell-Ewald.
Chevy's right arm. They got 200 people in Detroit.
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.
Ha, fantastic. Two steamships and a rowboat.
You had to write that down?
- There's no pictures. - It's a GM car.
It's got four wheels and an engine.
No, it's totally new.
I want you to go to the library
and get me everything you can on Mustang.
- And Chevy. - No, forget that.
They know there's been nothing before Mustang
and nothing after it, but they're hoping it's this.
No one and nothing leaves my office.
How about that?
How 'bout it?
Are you okay?
I just wanted to watch "Hazel,"
but I can't get any reception.
I think you should go home.
I love how you work every account like it's make or break.
I need some of that right now.
You've been working plenty.
I have a new way to go.
I'd show it to you, but it's top secret and it may be terrible.
Maybe Frank's right.
We should have never dumped Alfa.
It's one thing to want something, it's another to need it.
This is your agency.
You're always going to need something.
Don't let Frank Gleason make you question it.


Well, it's Frank's agency, too, Peggy.
And I've been counting on his paintbrush and his negativity
to balance me out for 20 years.
Fine.
But I've spent a lot of time
working with pessimistic people
and I like the fact that you're--
Do not say I'm nice.
I hate it when people say I'm nice.
I was going to say strong.
I'm sorry.
I'm just grateful.
No, of course.
Good night, Peggy.
Yes.
Good night.
Hold that.
I got it.
You want to go celebrate? I just quit my job.
What? Really?
I had a heart and a kid who needed the heart
and now they're both dead.
I'm not gonna get the opportunity.
I'm tired of fighting.
Well, you're fighting God in a way.
Oh, bullshit.
You don't think God's in Houston?
My hospital chickened out
and now some assh*le down there is taking my place
in history while I piss away my life in New York City.
You can't think that way.
Fate hasn't chosen me.
Look...
I don't cut people open. I don't believe in fate.
You make your own opportunities.
You sure you don't want to go for a drink?
I got work.
- How'd it go? - I don't know.
I was gonna sleep on it,
but now I think I'm just gonna shower and go back in.
I love you like this.
Desperate and scared?
Fearless.
And I want to do whatever I can
to make sure you do not fail.
Then you can jump from the balcony
and fly to work like Superman.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you, Daisy.
Actually, can you get those lugs
from Dancer bumped off the flight?
Roger, I told you, I can't hurt the company.
They bought most of the seats.
Jesus, there's like eight of them.
Surprised to see you here.
Taking your kid to look at colleges?
No, taking him to pick out a car.
Oh. When did they add you guys to the mix?
When they saw your work.
I wish you the best of luck.
In fact, maybe we shouldn't even go.
What are the billings for Vicks?
Nine million? Someone's gonna pick that up.
Any of you have a cough drop?
I know they don't.
Get him on the phone right now or I'm coming over there.
I've got it, Clara.
Roger's calling from the airport.
He says something happened with Vick Chemical.
Tell my father-in-law I am not joking.
Believe me, you do not want me in your lobby.
Let me talk to Roger.
So it's true?
No, I'm gonna fix it.
Jesus, they don't need to hear this right now.
Roger will handle it.
- Well? - They're screwing with us.
Really?
Daisy's gonna lose their luggage.
Well, apparently you didn't get any of my calls.
So I came down here to your lair.
Spare me the outrage, Pete.
I'm tired of it.
Tom, what are you doing?
I know we're both emotional and vulnerable,
but I'm not the enemy here.
I'm an adult, as are you.
And if anything, our relationship
has shown over the last seven years
that I have a very short memory.
Now, what can I do
to bring you back to reality
in this obviously impulsive decision?
My daughter is a princess.
She could have had anyone.
I knew there was a reason you never wanted children.
You have no business being a father.
You just pressed the button, Tom.
You just blew everything up.
Well, it makes me sick thinking about the man I saw
being with my daughter and my granddaughter.
Why don't you look in the mirror?
You can walk out like a man
or I can have you thrown out like the lowlife you are.
If I have as low character as you say,
why would you push me like this?
You'll do the right thing.
The paint fumes are making me sick.
I got the windows open.
It'll be dry in a couple of days.
And when am I gonna be able to walk around
my apartment in bare feet?
Soon. We're fixing it up.
In here, yes. But out there?
Those kids are living on our stoop
lighting firecrackers and playing their music.
And you keep waving to them.
Look, the neighborhood is changing.
We're a part of that.
I don't like change.
I want everything to stay the way it was.
I don't think you understand, babe.
Everything's getting better. Johnson's gone.
The w*r is gonna end.
We're gonna have a new president no matter what.
Maybe McCarthy. Worst case, Kennedy.
I love Bobby Kennedy.
Fine.
If that's what you want.
I just want you to kiss me.
Damn it.
Hello to you, too.
What the hell are you doing in Detroit?
My doctor recommended an ocean voyage.
Can I get one of those?
I don't believe this.
I spent six weeks on this pipe dream
and it's gonna be over in two seconds.
Hell, I knew I was good,
but I didn't know all I had to do was show up.
You don't know what this means?
It's not my job to put you at ease,
but just because they brought us in
at the last second doesn't mean you're dead.
Me? We're both dead.
I've had enough psychological warfare today.
- Why don't you take a table? - Think about it.
When it's two top 10 agencies and me, I've got a chance.
Now that there's two little guys, we're DOA.
I'm not worried. I've got great work.
Of course you do. And mine's even better, I guarantee.
You know how this works. They're gonna take our creative
and give it to one of the big boys.
Second place, tied with last.
Come on, you know I'm right.
So they want a name brand.
- We had a car. - So did we.
It's not the same thing.
It's the size of the team.
It's opening an office in Detroit.
This is General Motors.
They fight the w*r with bodies on the ground.
I saw Dancer at the airport.
Looked like half my office.
This business is rigged.
Damn it.
That's what I said.
Sorry about that.
I'm tired of this crap.
I should just let Chevy buy my brain and put it in a jar.
Can I get another?
Brain in a jar.
Put it on your tombstone.
"Here lies SCDP,
the little company with the big ideas."
"CGC, giving away creative one car at a time."
So what did you go with?
What, I show you mine, you show me yours?
What's the difference at this point?
You first.
Okay, but I've got to stand up.
This is a car for the young and the young at heart.
Because today nobody knows where they're headed,
but they're not afraid of what's around the bend.
Power plus design equals adventure.
Throw the map out the window and hit the road, Jack.
Then I sing the song.
- That's good. - No kidding.
Just music. People's faces.
All kinds-- teenagers, dads, moms.
Different expressions of wonder.
What could this possibly be?
It's so new,
this combination of power,
technology, comfort, and price
that it's impossible to imagine.
But not at Chevy.
The future
is something you haven't even thought of yet.
You run that for a week,
then you finally show the car.
That's interesting.
Hooray.
So should we go home?
We--
that's interesting.
Why, you want to stay just so Chevy
can put a feather in your cap?
I have a better idea.
No, you don't. I just heard it.
This is why everyone hates you.
Think about it.
Both of us have the creative,
but neither of us have an agency to match.
Why would I do that?
Because we're dead.
Even if I were to consider that, Chevy calls the shots.
Hey, Lieutenant,
want to get into some trouble?
How would that even work?
Well, one of us, probably me,
will have to figure out a way to make Chevy
think it was their idea to combine our agencies.
And then the other one, let's say it was you,
will have to figure out what the hell we're going to present.
Well, we have partners.
Who aren't sitting in this bar.
Can I get another?
No, we're done.
We've got a long night.
♪ My eyes were on the sparrow ♪
♪ My feet were on the ground ♪

I want to make it clear,
unless this works, I'm against it.
I was just saying the same thing.
Shall we?
After you.
You're not supposed to be here till the weekend.
I don't like you surprising me.
Sit down, Trudy.
Did you know your father pulled his business?
No.
And I don't care, Peter.
You understand that we were going to be very rich,
but he's ruined that.
He's done everything for you.
He's a hypocrite, Trudy.
Don't you dare criticize my father.
I guess it doesn't matter
that I caught him in a Midtown whorehouse.
Just stop it right now.
It's true. With a 200-pound n*gro prostitute.
Ask him to his face.
You'll say anything to hurt me, won't you?
He wanted it this way.
He left me no other choice.
You had lots of choices, Peter.
We're done. Get your things.
Mr. Chaough wants to see you.
- He's back? - That's all I know.
So, how'd it go?
We got it. We won Chevy.
What are you doing here?
We went in together.
What?
What are you talking about?
They wanted our ideas and a big agency,
so we gave them both.
Just for Chevy?
No, we merged--
furniture, fixtures, everything.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I did this wrong once before,
so let me tell you how great it's going to be
and you can decide if you want to come along.
You are the copy chief
at one of the top 25 ad agencies in the country.
You're not even 30. I'm jealous.
I just bought an apartment.
Congratulations.
Are we moving?
We are, and we'd like you to write the press release.
For what?
We don't have a name yet,
but make it sound like the agency
you want to work for.
Who do I give it to?
Give it to Ted.
New York City,
May 17, 1968.
For immediate release.
