Previously on Mad Men...
He is not your friend,he is the enemy.
You let Don talk,you should know better.
The guys not a salesman.
- Why do we care what that guy wants?- Because hes a client.
I dont want to live onthe Upper East side.
I saw us raising our kids in a placewith more different kinds of people.
I dont know what to say.
Say youre gonna be the first Americanto complete a successful heart transplant.
I could come up andstay there tonight, if you want.
Well be fine.
Are you sure you dont wantme to order in some food?
- Chinese?- Im sorry this is taking so long.
Its a common mistaketo not ask questions
when you want something becauseyoure afraid of the answers.
So you want something?
Im interested.
And considering the precedentfor small agencies,
this is how we mighttake you public.
With one and a halfmillion shares outstanding
before the offering, wed sell400,000 additional shares
to the public at $9 a share.
- 12 a share.- Its not an insult.
Our valuation of your company wasmade after careful analysis.
Of papers you spent20 minutes with?
I cant take thisto the rest of my partners,
but I can take itto other underwriters.
Ill need these documentsfor 24 hours.
These papers are spotless.My compliments to the chef.
Shall we?
You dont think Cooper pushed thatpoor banker too hard, do you?
We dont want to lose him.
Certainly not.
Its a marvel.
Everyone wants you, dont they?
Pete, no.
No, I believe our primaryhurdle has been cleared.
And our secondary one?
Dont worry about Don.Even at nine a share,
your part of the company alonewill be worth nearly $1 million.
My goodness.
Youre flushed.
I drank too fast.
I dont think Doncares about money.
That may be true.God bless him.
But hes tired of playingin the bush leagues.
This capitalizationwill double our size
and that will turn his head.
You want another?
No. I can hardly walkand you know it.
I hope Clara reminded youtomorrows Mothers Day.
Thank you, Im aware.
Ow.
Just wanted to make sureyou were still here.
I am, but not for long.
You dont even knowwhat time it is.
I do.
Because I already got upand put on my face.
Is that what you do?
- I wondered.- I have to go.
Daisy, youre a tease.
What more could I give you?
Look, the first-class lounge wouldbe a darker place without you,
but youre supposed to haveyour ear to the ground.
I feel like you only call mewhen you want to see me.
Am I going to see you tomorrow?
If theres a flight filled with P&Gexecutives headed back to Cincinnati.
- How about tonight?- I have plans.
Some other boyfriend? The oneyou give all the leads to?
With my mother.
Its Mothers Day.
Dont go.
I have to.
But my mother just died.
What are you doing?
You told me you wantedme here Sunday morning.
Im here.
Peter, dont.
So well just maintain everyother aspect of this marriage
except the one that matters.
You mean Tammy?
Will you stop holdingthe axe over my neck?
So youd rather I divorce you justso you know where things stand?
You dont care that I want you.
Ive taken noteof your efforts.
Im going to get her.
Well...
youre gonna be sorrywhen this is over.
Youve given up on meat exactly the wrong time.
I have big things coming.
You have no idea.
Well, Ill take noteof that, too.
_
_
_
_

Could you get that?
- Arnold. Come in.- Hi.
Im sorry to bother you.Do you have any wrapping paper?
Its an emergency.
Good morning.
Sorry, this isMegans mother Marie.
We passed in the lobby.I thought you were Megan.
Dr. Arnold Rosenat your service.
- Enchanté.- Are you French?
My kids going to Paris.Should I keep him home?
I am French,but I live in Montreal.
And, yes, I believe so.
I assume this isnta medical emergency.
Mitchell--thats my son--
he came home and surprisedher for Mothers Day.
- How long is he staying?- Who knows?
I know he thinks a morning strollin Central Park is a gift,
but Sylvias gonnaexpect an actual gift.
Do you want my flowers?Im quite done with them.
Thank you, Mother.
Youre a lifesaver.
Hes a surgeon. Hes workingon heart transplants.
Wealthy, talented,handsome--
I would not leave them alone.
Im more worried about you.
Theres poopon the stairs again.
Somebodys dog got in.
No, its human.
I think its from the tenant.
She wouldnt do that.
Shes a junkie.She doesnt care.
I want her out.
We cant do that.
How is your mother?
I got curtains.She wants to come visit.
Ah!Ow! Ow.
Jesus.
We have to hire a handyman.
Why?Its a waste of money.
Because you have no ideawhat youre doing.
Herb Rennet called. Hescanceling dinner tonight.
Thats a relief.
We can still have dinner.
Id love to discusssome things with you.
Lets enjoy our reprieve.
Of course.
Psst.Close the door.
Did he say your dinnerwith Jaguar is off?
Yes, unless it was theworlds most boring dream.
Well, its on,but Petes not invited.
Herb Rennet wants a word aloneto straighten things out.
Why cant you handle it?
This could be fatal.Youre going.
And my plan is to pack it withspouses to limit the expl*si*n.
Megan made planswith her mother.
She thought I hada business dinner.
Maries in town?Fantastic.
Bring her along.Thats perfect.
Tell her I insisted.
In attendanceI have Jim Cutler,
Frank Gleason, and Ted Chaough.
Sweetheart, this is a creative meeting.What are you doing?
Its for the purposesof the memorandum.
Well, Ted, some men lovewomen, some love memos.
I want to go over where we areon Chevrolet again
and devote our final daysto overdoing it
on the artwork forthe top three campaigns.
I cannot look at these again.
I told you, theyre very keenon the rocket ship thing
with the astronaut anecdotes.
You told themabout the astronauts?
I had to.It was too vague otherwise.
I dont want to drawany more rockets
and I dont want to stareat this work again.
We should have neverresigned Alfa Romeo.
What, is this mystery Chevygonna be in "The Graduate"?
Those things areflying off the lot.
Frank, are you noton board with this?
I love what youre doing.
Im tired of rockets,thats all.
Could you give us a moment?Well continue this later.
What is that, Shalimar?
Whats gotten into you?
Youre supposed to becalming me down.
Ted, Ive got cancer.
What?
In my pancreas.
I told Jim.I thought he told you
and you didnt wantto embarrass me.
No.
Maybe its more ofa financial issue to him,
but Im glad he cankeep a secret.
Financial?
The minute I cash out,I cash in.
You two have to buy me out.
You have cancer.
See, if we still had Alfa,I wouldnt have to worry
about putting youout of business.
First of all,
stop talking about money.
Second, we are goingto get Chevy
because youre goingto do your best work.
Third, youre goingto build a wing
at Sloan-Ketteringand b*at this thing.
Aye, aye.
Will you tell Jim you told me?
Hell see it on your face.
Everybody loves astronauts.
Ive got to go lie down.
Well, hello there.
How are things in Glocca Morra?
Hello. Can you hear me?
I love it when you whisper like that.What are you wearing?
My uniform.
I have oneand his flights delayed.
Who is he?Whats he do?
Im not sure,
but he doesnt believemy names really Daisy.
Use that.
Shit.
Do you mind?
17, please.
Im sorry to bother you,but we love your show.
Oh, thank you.
Can we get an autograph?
I know youre not waving to me.
Makes the delayworthwhile, doesnt it?
- Headed to Detroit?- Eventually.
Should we try LaGuardia?
They already did.Forget it.
This is why I liketo drive everywhere.
Id live in my car if I could.
You know, with herin the backseat navigating.
Im Roger.
- Whats your name?- Mikey.
Well, Mikey, since weregonna be cell mates,
Im going to ask the screwfor a couple of drinks.
Jim Beam.
Ill make her bring them over.
- Good idea.- Im full of em.
I want a glass of waterwith an onion
and bring hima double Jim Beam.
And get me on that flight.
_
This is my day off.We had plans.
_
_
Well, you would rather spend the eveninglaughing at Roger Sterlings jokes.
I should return home.Ive overstayed my welcome.
_
_
_
_
Well, I dont knowwhats happened.
I knew something was wrong.
We have not had a fight.
Hes so far away
that sometimeswhen were alone,
I feel likeIm making conversation.
Darling, you have confoundedeveryones expectations.
And it is very hardto stand next to someone
giving an autograph.
- He doesnt even care.- Of course he does.
But he may think you belong moreto other people than to him.
_
_
_
_
_
I love coming into the city.
Its 25 minutes,half hour give or take,
from Tenaflydepending on the traffic.
I always think Im gonnago to museums and stuff.
And theres some good ones.Youve probably seen them.
But I always end up at Saks.
And I come home
and Herb always saysthe same thing.
How much damagedid you do, Peaches?
We always do some shopping.
My daughter is very generous.
She even invited me alongto this wonderful evening.
You get a hold of Silver Bells?
No. That doesnt meanhes not coming.
Im pretty much done waiting.
Perhaps we should go.
What?
No, I thinkwere gonna order now.
Herb gets very peckish.
I skipped lunch.
Can I help you, Bert?
Youve already doneall you can do.
Snapped this place into shape,
expanded our businesswhile keeping it lean.
Pending due diligence,were done...
at $11 a share.
Really?
I believe I would like a drink.
What do you drink?
Do you have any brandy?
No.
Spirits of elderflower?
No. I dont haveany laudanum either.
- Surprise me.- Night, chief.
Bob, could you get Joan?
- And some ice.- Absolutely.
When do we break the news?
Call the meeting for tomorrow.
Ahh.
So there she was in the garage
right among the-- you know,theres an oil stain
that Herbs been meaningto take care of--
there she is, our little puppy,
with a full litter.
_
_
_
Youre right, Mother. Theymust have been adorable.
Theres one yellowand one brown
and then three sort of mixed.
Each one at its own nipple.
I love puppies.
Not the way she does.
_
You know what?Why dont we let the men
discuss the business theyreprobably here to talk about
while we powder our noses?
Tall and tanand young and lovely.
So why are we here, Herb?
Oh, its nothing serious.I just had an idea.
Theres a kid whos beenwriting fliers for me
at a few of my lots
and Im really getting results.
Hes got a good turn of phrase.
I think youd appreciate it.
Is he looking for a job?
No, hes got a job.
I just thought thatit might help you and me
if he were to take a lookat some of your work,
even at the formative stages,
just to get his take on it.
Whats his name?
Fawcett.
Chris Fawcett.
Here you go.
- What is this?- Its the name of the guy
whos going to be handlingyour account from now on.
You never failto overheat, do you?
You know the somersaults Imdoing cause youre so touchy?
Really?A man your size?
You know what?
Your whole company shouldbe taken to the woodshed.
First Campbellgives me the sass.
Then Sterling,he didnt even show up.
And you-- huh, yeah--my friend,
youre gonnabe working for him.
And he couldteach you something
like knowing whereyour bread is buttered.
Why dont you get this?
I want you to buy meone last meal.
Im tired of taking itout of your account.
Okay.
And if you eversee Sterling again,
tell him you screwed up
cause Im donewith all of youse.
Dont sit down.Dinners over.
Are you okay?
Never felt better in my life.
Nice meeting you.See you soon.
My mother needs an aspirin.
I dont care.
- Hello?- Marie.
Its Roger.Im so glad I got you.
If you are callingto apologize, dont bother.
- Its too late. Good night.- Hold on, hold on, dont hang up.
- Let me talk to Don.- Did you call to talk to Don?
Yes, but I was hoping you were there.You were next, I swear.
You dragged me outand made me sit
with that disgusting manwith his disgusting wife.
She is the apple that goesin the pigs mouth.
Marie, I swear I wouldnthave missed it for the world.
Its just something came up,
something very important
that I need to talkto Don about.
You are speaking slowlyso I will understand?
Forget... my... name.
Excuse me.
Is it possible for meto pay for my friend?
Yes, butits too late for that.
What are you bugging him for?
Arent I enough for you?
This is my friend. Whatwas your fake name again?
Curious George?
Youre a riot.
Hello.
Good night.
Isnt that guy a client?
Is he gone?
Yes.
I have a high-levelaccounts question.
A hypothetical.
So it doesnt involveanybody in this room?
Lets say you caught your father-in-lawin a compromising position.
Its every Sunday night.The guy cant hold his liquor.
Last night I was celebratingat that party house up on Lex
and I saw my father-in-lawexit the bedroom
with the biggest,
blackest prostituteyouve ever seen.
Was there anyone elsefrom Vicks there?
Not that I saw.But we spoke.
I mean, all I saidwas hello, but--
Okay, look,when I was in high school,
they had this picture come to theonly movie theater in Cabot.
It was called"Making A Baby."
They invited womenand men separately,
but it was a delivery systemfor some filthy stuff.
So at the matinee, I look over
and Mr. Miller my scienceteacher is five seats away.
And hes not, you know, workingthe slide rule or anything,
but we see each other for sure.
But we both knew that neitherof us should be there.
It was mutuallyassured destruction.
So hes not goingto say anything?
He cant.
Mr. Cosgrove,I have a phone call.
Give me a second.
Its why I dont worryabout the b*mb.
Its urgent.
I have Hugh Hibbertand John Echolls from Jaguar.
Why are they calling you?Pick it up.
This is Ken.
Good morning.
Do you have any idea where Rogerhas been for the last 24 hours?
- I dont.- Draper!
What in the hell have you--
- What?- You have done it again.
What did you sayto Herb Rennet last night?
Nothing that shouldnt havebeen said last Christmas.
As usual, you haveacted impulsively
and harmed the companyirreparably.
- Pete, calm down.- Wed already lost the account.
He was gonna bring insome kid to write copy.
Thats because youscrewed him last time.
You couldnt wait.
Pete, youve got tounderstand when its over.
Do you know that we hada public offering underway?
And now its ruined!
- What?- You dont care about the company.
- Youre already rich.- Not here.
Inside.
- What is going on?- Why the hell didnt I know about this?
- Were going public?- Not anymore.
- When did that happen?- I was going to tell you this morning.
I tried to last night, but youdrather have dinner with Herb Rennet.
Well, I have some good newsand some bad news.
- Where the hell have you been?- Don fired Jaguar.
What?
Then I just have good news.Were giving a presentation
this Friday on Chevystop secret new car.
- What?- Friday?
Come on, youve been thinkingabout Chevy your whole life.
- Are you serious?- And I have this check for $10,000
because I close, Pete.I close things.
Did I mention I was in Detroit
where my friend Mikey OBrien--look him up--
said he was looking forsomething cutting-edge,
but none of the agencieshad it?
So he had a great idea.Bring us in.
Were not afraid of a deadline.
Holy crap.Chevy.
You want to go public?
How much better is itwhen we have Chevy?
Dont act like you had a plan.
Youre Tarzanswinging from vine to vine.
Roger, I want to know everything.Pete, go box up Jaguar.
Make sure they haveall their files today.
Joan, get the creativesin my office.
Get them yourself.
Dont you feel300 pounds lighter?
I dont.
Honestly, Don, if I could dealwith him, you could deal with him.
And what now?
I went throughall of that for nothing?
Joan, dont worry.I will win this.
Just once
I would like to hearyou use the word "we."
Because were all rootingfor you from the sidelines,
hoping that youll decide whateveryou think is right for our lives.
In my office, all of you.
Should we go in there?
I dont care.
XP-887.
- So we get to name it?- Possibly.
For now its allcloak-and-dagger.
Theyve got a room fullof R&D on this.
But it boils downto Chevrolets top brass
trying to buildthe perfect car.
- They designed it with a computer.- So theyre scared.
They run another agency inat the one-yard line.
Theyre terrified.
So who else is in it?
Well, the guest list limping in
is as follows--Campbell-Ewald.
Chevys right arm. They got200 people in Detroit.
Dancer Fitzgerald Sample
and Cutler Gleason and Chaough.
Ha, fantastic. Twosteamships and a rowboat.
You had to write that down?
- Theres no pictures.- Its a GM car.
Its got four wheelsand an engine.
No, its totally new.
I want you to go to the library
and get me everythingyou can on Mustang.
- And Chevy.- No, forget that.
They know theres beennothing before Mustang
and nothing after it, buttheyre hoping its this.
No one and nothingleaves my office.
How about that?
How bout it?
Are you okay?
I just wanted to watch "Hazel,"
but I cant get any reception.
I think you should go home.
I love how you work every accountlike its make or break.
I need some of that right now.
Youve been working plenty.
I have a new way to go.
Id show it to you, but its topsecret and it may be terrible.
Maybe Franks right.
We should havenever dumped Alfa.
Its one thing to want something,its another to need it.
This is your agency.
Youre always goingto need something.
Dont let Frank Gleasonmake you question it.


Well, its Franks agency,too, Peggy.
And Ive been counting on hispaintbrush and his negativity
to balance me out for 20 years.
Fine.
But Ive spent a lot of time
working with pessimistic people
and I like the factthat youre--
Do not say Im nice.
I hate it when peoplesay Im nice.
I was going to say strong.
Im sorry.
Im just grateful.
No, of course.
Good night, Peggy.
Yes.
Good night.
Hold that.
I got it.
You want to go celebrate?I just quit my job.
What? Really?
I had a heart and a kidwho needed the heart
and now theyre both dead.
Im not gonna getthe opportunity.
Im tired of fighting.
Well, youre fightingGod in a way.
Oh, bullshit.
You dont thinkGods in Houston?
My hospital chickened out
and now some assh*le downthere is taking my place
in history while I piss awaymy life in New York City.
You cant think that way.
Fate hasnt chosen me.
Look...
I dont cut people open.I dont believe in fate.
You make your ownopportunities.
You sure you dont wantto go for a drink?
I got work.
- Howd it go?- I dont know.
I was gonna sleep on it,
but now I think Im justgonna shower and go back in.
I love you like this.
Desperate and scared?
Fearless.
And I want to do whatever I can
to make sure you do not fail.
Then you can jumpfrom the balcony
and fly to work like Superman.
Will there be anything else?
No, thank you, Daisy.
Actually, can youget those lugs
from Dancerbumped off the flight?
Roger, I told you,I cant hurt the company.
They bought most of the seats.
Jesus, theres likeeight of them.
Surprised to see you here.
Taking your kidto look at colleges?
No, taking himto pick out a car.
Oh. When did they addyou guys to the mix?
When they saw your work.
I wish you the best of luck.
In fact,maybe we shouldnt even go.
What are the billingsfor Vicks?
Nine million? Someonesgonna pick that up.
Any of you have a cough drop?
I know they dont.
Get him on the phone right nowor Im coming over there.
Ive got it, Clara.
Rogers callingfrom the airport.
He says something happenedwith Vick Chemical.
Tell my father-in-lawI am not joking.
Believe me, you do notwant me in your lobby.
Let me talk to Roger.
So its true?
No, Im gonna fix it.
Jesus, they dont needto hear this right now.
Roger will handle it.
- Well?- Theyre screwing with us.
Really?
Daisys gonna losetheir luggage.
Well, apparently youdidnt get any of my calls.
So I came down hereto your lair.
Spare me the outrage, Pete.
Im tired of it.
Tom, what are you doing?
I know were bothemotional and vulnerable,
but Im not the enemy here.
Im an adult, as are you.
And if anything,our relationship
has shown overthe last seven years
that I havea very short memory.
Now, what can I do
to bring you back to reality
in this obviouslyimpulsive decision?
My daughter is a princess.
She could have had anyone.
I knew there was a reasonyou never wanted children.
You have no businessbeing a father.
You just pressedthe button, Tom.
You just blew everything up.
Well, it makes me sickthinking about the man I saw
being with my daughterand my granddaughter.
Why dont you lookin the mirror?
You can walk out like a man
or I can have you thrown outlike the lowlife you are.
If I have as low characteras you say,
why would youpush me like this?
Youll do the right thing.
The paint fumesare making me sick.
I got the windows open.
Itll be dryin a couple of days.
And when am I gonnabe able to walk around
my apartment in bare feet?
Soon.Were fixing it up.
In here, yes.But out there?
Those kids are livingon our stoop
lighting firecrackersand playing their music.
And you keep waving to them.
Look, the neighborhoodis changing.
Were a part of that.
I dont like change.
I want everything to staythe way it was.
I dont thinkyou understand, babe.
Everythings getting better.Johnsons gone.
The w*r is gonna end.
Were gonna have a newpresident no matter what.
Maybe McCarthy.Worst case, Kennedy.
I love Bobby Kennedy.
Fine.
If thats what you want.
I just want you to kiss me.
Damn it.
Hello to you, too.
What the hellare you doing in Detroit?
My doctor recommendedan ocean voyage.
Can I get one of those?
I dont believe this.
I spent six weekson this pipe dream
and its gonna be overin two seconds.
Hell, I knew I was good,
but I didnt knowall I had to do was show up.
You dont know what this means?
Its not my jobto put you at ease,
but just becausethey brought us in
at the last seconddoesnt mean youre dead.
Me?Were both dead.
Ive had enoughpsychological warfare today.
- Why dont you take a table?- Think about it.
When its two top 10 agenciesand me, Ive got a chance.
Now that theres twolittle guys, were DOA.
Im not worried.Ive got great work.
Of course you do. And mineseven better, I guarantee.
You know how this works. Theyregonna take our creative
and give it to oneof the big boys.
Second place, tied with last.
Come on, you know Im right.
So they want a name brand.
- We had a car.- So did we.
Its not the same thing.
Its the size of the team.
Its opening an officein Detroit.
This is General Motors.
They fight the w*rwith bodies on the ground.
I saw Dancer at the airport.
Looked like half my office.
This business is rigged.
Damn it.
Thats what I said.
Sorry about that.
Im tired of this crap.
I should just let Chevy buymy brain and put it in a jar.
Can I get another?
Brain in a jar.
Put it on your tombstone.
"Here lies SCDP,
the little companywith the big ideas."
"CGC, giving away creativeone car at a time."
So what did you go with?
What, I show you mine,you show me yours?
Whats the differenceat this point?
You first.
Okay, but Ive got to stand up.
This is a car for the youngand the young at heart.
Because today nobody knowswhere theyre headed,
but theyre not afraidof whats around the bend.
Power plus designequals adventure.
Throw the map out the windowand hit the road, Jack.
Then I sing the song.
- Thats good.- No kidding.
Just music.Peoples faces.
All kinds-- teenagers,dads, moms.
Different expressionsof wonder.
What could this possibly be?
Its so new,
this combination of power,
technology, comfort, and price
that its impossibleto imagine.
But not at Chevy.
The future
is something you haventeven thought of yet.
You run that for a week,
then you finally show the car.
Thats interesting.
Hooray.
So should we go home?
We--
thats interesting.
Why, you want to stayjust so Chevy
can put a feather in your cap?
I have a better idea.
No, you dont.I just heard it.
This is why everyone hates you.
Think about it.
Both of us have the creative,
but neither of ushave an agency to match.
Why would I do that?
Because were dead.
Even if I were to considerthat, Chevy calls the shots.
Hey, Lieutenant,
want to get into some trouble?
How would that even work?
Well, one of us, probably me,
will have to figure outa way to make Chevy
think it was their ideato combine our agencies.
And then the other one,lets say it was you,
will have to figure out what thehell were going to present.
Well, we have partners.
Who arent sitting in this bar.
Can I get another?
No, were done.
Weve got a long night.
♪ My eyes were on the sparrow ♪
♪ My feet were on the ground ♪
♪ I used to walkthe straight and narrow ♪
♪ Never fly around ♪
♪ Till one night at a party ♪
♪ I met you,Baby Jane... ♪
I want to make it clear,
unless this works,Im against it.
I was just sayingthe same thing.
Shall we?
After you.
Youre not supposed to behere till the weekend.
I dont like you surprising me.
Sit down, Trudy.
Did you know your fatherpulled his business?
No.
And I dont care, Peter.
You understand that we weregoing to be very rich,
but hes ruined that.
Hes done everything for you.
Hes a hypocrite, Trudy.
Dont you darecriticize my father.
I guess it doesnt matter
that I caught himin a Midtown whorehouse.
Just stop it right now.
Its true. With a 200-poundn*gro prostitute.
Ask him to his face.
Youll say anythingto hurt me, wont you?
He wanted it this way.
He left me no other choice.
You had lots of choices, Peter.
Were done.Get your things.
Mr. Chaoughwants to see you.
- Hes back?- Thats all I know.
So, howd it go?
We got it.We won Chevy.
What are you doing here?
We went in together.
What?
What are you talking about?
They wanted our ideasand a big agency,
so we gave them both.
Just for Chevy?
No, we merged--
furniture, fixtures,everything.
Im sorry, I dont understand.
I did this wrong once before,
so let me tell youhow great its going to be
and you can decideif you want to come along.
You are the copy chief
at one of the top 25ad agencies in the country.
Youre not even 30.Im jealous.
I just bought an apartment.
Congratulations.
Are we moving?
We are, and wed like youto write the press release.
For what?
We dont have a name yet,
but make it soundlike the agency
you want to work for.
Who do I give it to?
Give it to Ted.
New York City,
May 17, 1968.
For immediate release.
