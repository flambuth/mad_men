Dawn Chambers, please.
( Phone rings)
- Dawn Chambers. - I'm glad I caught you.
I need ribbon for my typewriter.
It's a Coronet.
And I have letterhead, but I could use a ream of onionskin.
Okay.
And I wrote a letter to Fritz over at Leica.
I'm going to need an airmail envelope.
I can get these sent over to you right now.
- Just bring them with you. - Mr. Draper, I'm swamped.
I have to get a schedule out for a sh**t.
So you can come a little later. What are you sh**ting?
- Mountain Dew. - Oh.
What is it?
Um, it's called "Invisible Boy."
It's this kid--
Ginsberg finally got that through.
I guess so.
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can get a messenger to you in 20 minutes,
unless you're going out.
Obviously I didn't make any plans.
I was expecting you to come over.
Were there any calls?
- ( Phone ringing) - Just Mr. Alan Silver
from the Paul Kohner Agency in Los Angeles.
Can you get him on the line?
I'm sorry, my phone is ringing off the hook.
I hope it's okay. He says you have his number.
Or I can give it to you again.
No, Dawn, I want you to call him.
I, uh-- can you hold?
Don Draper for Alan Silver.
Don. Glad I caught you.
I was beginning to give up hope.
How can I help you?
It's a bit of a casting issue.
I don't know if I can help you with that.
Well, it has to do with our girl.
And I'm probably overreacting,
but you're the closest thing to a manager
and, let's face it, you probably have more influence.
( laughs ) You better.
Just get to it, Alan.
Megan went into an audition
and performed adequately from what I can tell
and by the time she got to the parking lot
decided to call casting
and ask if she could come back in and do it differently.
So she's persistent.
On Sunday she got the director's number
from someone in her acting class, called his home,
then managed to run into him at the Brentwood Country Mart
while he was having lunch with Rod Serling.
She met Rod Serling?
I don't even know if she knew he was there.
She apparently pled her case in tears
and demanded another reading.
Why would she do that?
It's not like I've never seen this before.
They lose their confidence.
But I don't want anyone to have that anecdote.
It's best we nip this in the bud.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You know her better than I do.
I tried to talk to her, but she hung up.
You have to tell her to relax.
She really is doing well as the new girl in town.
Yeah.
Well, then, I don't want to take up any more of your precious time.
Yeah, thank you.
- ( Phone ringing) - ( approaching footsteps )
It's the Clios. Who cares?
I do, but you shouldn't give them the power
to decide who shall live and who shall die.
Stan and I are part of the agency and Playtex is our client.
We'd feel the same if it was the other way around.
Would you describe that as patronizing?
I'm not taking anything away from anybody.
But I'm not going to do better work than St. Joseph's.
Lou's finishing his call.
You'll get 'em next year.
I gave that account to you when I left.
I worked Playtex for years.
Well, maybe you didn't work it right.
Lou: Send in the cavalry.
Morning.
Mr. Draper, good morning.
A weekday? What a treat.
Nice to see you, Tricia.
No briefcase?
I'm going to surprise my wife.
I've said it before-- I hate her.
What can I get you?
Tomato juice.
Freeze-frame as our stallion runs through the background.
The bottle appears.
Announcer-- "Chevalier Noir.
More horsepower."
Why is there artwork?
Well, I believe it really helps if you see it.
You understand every hour he works costs money?
You can't be hypothetical.
- It took a second, Lou. - Stay out of it, Rizzo.
It's already done. Would you just look at it?
Who put a knot in your pantyhose?
She's upset because I got nominated for a Clio
and "Rosemary's Baby" didn't.
I don't care about awards.
Oh, sorry, Peggy.
Jim pulled it because St. Joseph's
was still unhappy about going over budget
and all the awards Ted's already won for them.
They're upset about winning?
You know clients hate awards.
That's why Ogilvy never submits.
He does it for the clients. Trust me.
Wasn't Ogilvy the chairman of the Clios last year?
That's comforting-- you weren't rejected.
You weren't even considered.
- Are we finished? - Sorry about that.
- You want to go to color? - Ask your boss.
I'm usually by his side.
The real challenge in our life has been trying to get Rocky's attention.
Rocky.
I told you last time to tell him that I'm an admirer.
( Chuckles )
After Henry patched things up,
he'd hoped to be on the short list for AG.
Attorney general.
But I shouldn't be talking about this.
How are things in real estate?
I'm a travel agent, Betty.
But you're still going to take that exam again, aren't you?
No, it's going swimmingly.
I'm in the office three days a week now.
"Wanderlust Travel."
- That's spicy. - Take a few.
I'm sure you'll need them.
Henry's secretary takes care of all that.
But she still has to book through somebody.
Trust me, it's not all about breaking the rack rate on a hotel room.
It's about perfection.
One of my clients told me that I redefined
his definition of first class.
Three days a week in an office.
What's that like?
It's a little shopping center in Dobbs Ferry.
Just a storefront, really. A bunch of desks.
Everybody's on the phone all the time,
so you have to keep one finger in your ear.
I have three phones and no secretary.
Sometimes I can't turn my neck when I get home.
Doesn't Carlton complain?
He likes the money.
He wants me to let the girl go, and I probably should.
Ernie and Jenny are walking to school now.
Well, Gene's a few years away from that.
Oh, your time's occupied.
But for the rest of us,
as they get older, there's less and less to do.
Being alone in the house all that time.
I really needed a challenge.
Well, there's still plenty of challenges ahead, believe me.
Fine, I needed a reward.
I thought they were the reward.
I don't know. Maybe I'm old-fashioned.
Betty Draper, that is indeed how I would describe you.
I want that streusel coffee cake. Will you split?
Of course.
Well, hello. How are you doing, Tom?
- Randall. - Good.
Our good friends at Koss here, and frankly I'll include myself,
have a few questions for you.
I'd love to explain anything.
I think it's the media plan we agreed upon.
No.
It's about this article from a few weeks back.
Yes, I've seen this, obviously.
I'm very happy with our media plan,
but Grey has this computer that they're opening up to everybody.
We just thought maybe we should look into it.
Or you should.
Look, may I sit down?
This is a very enviable piece of PR.
Grey gets "The New York Times" to tell all about their computer
by offering their services up to the world.
But I swear, as clever as it is, it's just PR.
I'm an engineer.
You can explain to me what the difference is
between their computer and your computer.
Well, computers don't think. People do.
And the data accumulated by me and my department
reflects the same national availability of media.
What we will be able to offer soon is local data as well.
We will be able to integrate local and national markets into one report.
We are developing that program.
There you have it.
You'll forgive me,
but Grey's does sound very impressive.
They're a different kind of agency.
I wasn't even invited to this meeting because this is about your business.
Koss, that's the only name that should be in the paper.
Very well put.
Tom, does that put you at ease?
I'm really sorry to put you through that.
Randy warned me, but, you know, I got to ask.
( laughs )
I'll walk you out.
You said you wanted to poke your head in and say hi to Peggy?
It's good to see you. Got to get you out on that boat.
Thank you, Jim. Harry, always a pleasure.
What are you smiling about?
Did you not call for a fireman?
Why the hell is Grey Advertising coming up in my meeting?
Well, that article could have been about us
if anyone appreciated our media department.
Are you aware your self-pity is distasteful?
You know what? This conversation is over.
I'm really not interested.
( Car approaches )
Hello.
You're here! You surprised me!
Maybe I got your hints.
I've never, ever admitted that I wanted this.
What happened? Did you get fired?
I just had a hankering.
Really?
Well, an extra special hankering you shall get.
( TV playing )
Hello.
Loretta, please.
They're not watching.
No, I believe they're not interested in that.
Aren't you helping Bobby with his homework?
Yes, ma'am.
You got to sign this slip for Bobby's field trip.
How was everyone today?
They're little angels.
They're looking for chaperones. I can take Genie along.
Well, if you can remember to turn this in, I want to go along.
You do? You're gonna come?
Yes. Yes, lam.
Great. It's Miss Keyser's dad's farm.
She grew up there and they make butter and grow eggs.
Well, we'll see all that, won't we?
I'm going to change.
I really needed that.
I really needed this.
So I could have been anyone.
It's your own fault.
I think I've been alone too much.
You have so many friends, I can't keep track.
I don't know.
(Sighs)
It's sunny here for everyone but me.
I'm walking around in a cloud of "no."
Megan, you know, they're getting rejected, too.
Maybe they're just handling it better.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I'm speaking from experience.
You can't let it erode your confidence.
And you can't get angry or desperate.
I know that.
I know all that.
What the hell are you doing here?
Alan called me.
What? He called you?
I'm your husband. He was worried.
Great, now l have to fire him.
What am I gonna do? How am I gonna find someone new?
You don't have to fire anyone.
You just have to stop acting like a lunatic.
What did he say?
You know what? Forget it.
So you came out here to what?
Pull me out of a bathtub where I slit my wrists?
I'll admit it, I was worried.
Well, thanks for the visit, Daddy.
I was stupid for thinking you could possibly miss me.
I do miss you.
No, you don't.
I should fly in and surprise you.
Yeah, that's a scary thought, isn't it?
- No. - Really?
You're never there when I call
and you always have to call me back.
And it's always quiet.
Where is it quiet in that office?
And I've never even heard a typewriter.
- That's not true. - Yes, it is true.
I'm sorry I had to interrupt your love affairs
with the disaster of my career.
Megan, sit down.
I was your secretary, remember?
I know what you're like when you're left alone.
- You're acting crazy. - So where are you?
Why can't I reach you? Who's your new girl, Don?
There is no one else.
I've been at home.
They put me on leave, okay?
You lost your job?
Don't worry, I'm still getting paid.
I don't give a shit. When did this happen?
Right after you left.
They fired you last year?
I didn't get fired. That's the thing.
I don't know if they want me or they don't want me.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I messed up
and I didn't want you to know until I fixed it.
And there is no one else. I've been good.
I haven't even been drinking that much.
So with a clear head,
you got up every day and decided
that you didn't want to be with me?
Megan.
(Sighs)
Mm, I'm not walking out of my own house.
So that means you have to leave.
Have you calmed down?
I'm not kidding around.
I want you to call a cab, get on a plane, go home.
I don't want you to worry about me anymore.
- Stop it. - It's okay, Don.
This is the way it ends.
It's going to be so much easier for both of us.
- ( Intercom buzzes) - Woman: I have Mr. Grady calling.
He's from "The Wall Street Journal."
Really? Put him through.
( Phone rings)
Ahem, Harold Crane here.
We have a situation.
I know this isn't the message,
but we can all learn something from the funeral business.
Did you tell "The Wall Street Journal" to give me a call?
(Sighs)
I felt badly about diminishing your contributions
in this morning's meeting.
And let's face it, this computer situation is an arms race.
There's no point in winning if people don't know.
Well, we're not winning. We don't have a computer.
What?
Believe me, I ask for one every Christmas
and no one even bothers to say no.
Well, why did you tell the client we do?
It's semantics.
We use a computer, therefore I call it our computer.
But it's actually someone else's computer.
And the local markets program?
It's a great idea.
I'm sure someone's going to do that.
You have stiff competition, but I believe you to be
the most dishonest man I have ever worked with.
I didn't call "The Wall Street Journal."
k*ll it.
(phone ringing)
- Woman: Dave Wooster's office. - ls Dave in?
It's Clarence Birdseye calling.
Just a minute. Let me see if he's available.
Dave: Well, hello, Don.
Enough dancing around. Let's have dinner.
How's tonight?
7:30. The Algonquin.
( Exhales )
Well, while we're digesting,
perhaps you should do a little digesting.
You can look at it now or you can put it in your pocket,
but you can't use it as a coaster.
Why don't you just tell me what's in it?
Why don't you look?
- That's coy. - No, that's drama.
Woman: Excuse me.
I'm sure you caught my eye during dinner.
I was only staring because I believe we know each other.
Emily Arnett?
I'm afraid I can't place you.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt anything.
Would you like to join us?
No, I'm off to bed.
Hopefully I'll be able to sleep.
I'm on the top floor right next to the elevator.
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
Have a good night.
Who was she?
Fellas, there's no need for the hard sell.
We had nothing to do with that.
I wish I'd thought of it.
Should we get another drink or do you have someplace to be?
( Chuckles )
( knocks )
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Are you alone?
For the time being.
I came by because I had a quick question.
- sh**t. - How do you sleep at night?
You know what? I called you at Christmas.
I'm sorry I opened the door. I was expecting a BLT.
Why would I want to talk to you when you fired me?
I got the message. "Merry Christmas, love, Judas."
What is this?
That's a nice offer.
They're really trying to make it sound like it's not a demotion.
So I take the job? That's your advice?
If that's what you want to do.
Well, I know what you want me to do. Go away.
I guess you don't remember I started that company.
I had to talk you into it.
I guess you forgot I found you at the bottom of a fur box.
I would never have done that to you.
Oh, come on. Don't be a big baby about it.
You were a disaster. We did you a favor.
The man who talked to Hershey?
I've seen that man wandering the streets with a sandwich board
saying "The end is near."
- So I have my answer. - I didn't know the question?
You want to come back? Come back.
I miss you.
( Knocking on door)
- Who is it? - Sherry: Room service.
Oh.
I didn't know we had company.
Yeah, for once, it's a friend of mine.
Sherry, this is Don.
I was just leaving.
Come in Monday.
(phone ringing)
- Megan: Hello? - It's me.
Hello.
I wanted to hear your voice.
I don't have a lot to say.
Then you can just listen.
I...
I shouldn't have lied to you.
And I'm sorry.
And I want everything to be okay.
(Sighs)
Are you there?
Yes.
I can see now that I wasn't...
thinking clearly
and I had this logic to what I did and...
hopefully now...
things can be the way we want them to be
because I'm going back to the agency.
Good for you.
I don't know if I can undo it, but I think I fixed it.
"I fixed it" is you got a job out here.
That's what you promised me. That's why I'm here.
I just thought that if you found out what happened...
you wouldn't look at me in the same way.
I can't believe after all this time you don't know me.
I know how I want you to see me.
Don't lie to me.
Don't do that.
You can't do that.
I'm your wife.
Stop pushing me away with both hands.
I could come back out.
I have the weekend.
( Sniffles )
(Sighs)
Not now.
It's not a good idea.
I love you.
Good night.
There's basically Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolf Man,
the Mummy, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
- That's quite a few. - There's also King Kong, too,
but he's not really a monster.
I like all of them, but I guess Wolf Man's my favorite
because he changes into it.
Dracula changes into a bat.
That's true.
16, 18...
It's nice to see somebody getting along.
We were having a conversation.
Thank you so much for helping out.
( Bus thumps)
Makes my job so much easier.
Bobby asked and I couldn't say no.
My mom loves animals.
She really likes you.
Yes, well, that blouse says she likes everyone.
It's Lou, right?
Oh, hello there.
Good to see you.
Sure.
How are you, Don?
Ready to get back to work.
Good for you.
Hello there.
Oh, Don! Look at you.
- How are you? - I'm good.
It's been too long.
Here I am.
Why don't you let me take that up to him?
( laughs ) To Roger?
No, he's not in yet. That's mine.
Do you want some?
When do you expect him? I think we have a meeting.
I'm always the last to know.
It's fine.
I'll keep myself occupied.
Great to see you again.
Keep that.
- Is Jim Cutler in yet? - I think he's at breakfast.
I don't care if he's in bed with Joey Heatherton.
Get him on the horn.
Ginsberg: Don?
Is that you?
Hello, Michael.
Ed, come here. Look who's here.
Oh, hi, Don. Great to see you.
Boy, you smell good.
Hey, you know what? Are you busy?
- What do you mean? - Don't bother him.


He'll know. Come here.
Chevalier Blanc has started Chevalier Noir.
That's "night," or "black."
Either way, it's the opposite of Blanc.
And we're supposed to work up print
based on this voiceover tagline, "More horsepower."
And you gotta see the words, but it ends with a freeze-frame.
What does?
The TV spot.
Oh. I assume you have storyboards.
Exit stage left.
What have you been up to, Don?
Just R&R mostly.
Do you want to see the strategy?
Sure.
What happened to the storyboards from Chevalier Noir?
She gave them to Lou.
What do I do? Don wants to see 'em.
- Don? - Don-- Draper.
Says who?
Says him. He's outside.
Right now? What's he doing here?
You want I should ask him?
What's he doing?
Who cares?
- What's going on? - Shh! Look.
What is he doing here?
Maybe he finished drying out.
Meredith, we better get back to work.
Hello, Don.
Hello, Stan.
Where you been? Riding the rails?
- Turns out Lou's got the boards. - It's fine.
Mr. Draper.
Morning, Dawn.
Seems to be some lapse in communication
regarding my return.
No one told me.
Could you just let me know when someone tracks down Mr. Sterling?
- Can I get some coffee? - Certainly.
Why don't you fellas catch me up?
You want me to get everything?
Whatever you got handy.
Let's start with the garbage.
( Cow moos )
Children, this is my father, Farmer Cy.
You can call me Cyrus or Cy or "hey, mister."
( laughs )
If you look around, you can see pigs
and goats and chickens.
And Pammy's favorite, the horsies.
We've got all the animals.
But this farm is mostly for growing potatoes,
so there's not a lot above ground.
But I know you're all here to see the cows.
So why don't we walk this way?
I'm sorry, ladies, but there's no smoking in the barn.
I'll be along.
You're not afraid of missing them milk the cow?
I'll be done in a minute.
Well, I hope no one accidentally grabs on the wrong udders.
Excuse me?
Farmer's daughter needs a bra.
( laughs )
( clicking )
- Mm-hmm. - Do you need my lighter?
Would you mind?
Don? ls that you?
Boys, excuse me a minute.
Don, what a pleasant surprise.
You're looking well, Joan.
What have you been up to? What are you doing here?
- Waiting. - For what?
You two just getting in?
We had a breakfast meeting.
What are you doing here?
I guess I'm waiting for Roger.
Oh, I see.
Well...
it was nice seeing you.
Guess what. Cynthia had a little boy.
Edward, but we call him Eddie.
Eddie Cosgrove.
That's the carousel in Central Park.
Always makes me think of you.
Now I know what you'll look like bald.
( laughs )
( knocks ) May I have a word?
Don't linger in the door.
I'm wearing boots.
Yes, fine, dear.
Did you know that Don Draper is downstairs?
Doing what?
He says he's waiting for Roger. Does that ring a bell?
He shouldn't be here.
So obviously I would like to get married,
but, you know, I don't really have any savings.
I mean, it doesn't make any sense to borrow money from my parents
just so I look successful in front of hers, does it?
I don't know. That is a tough spot.
What the hell is going on in here?
We were just catching up.
That's nice, ladies. You four, in my office.
- We have that meeting. - What meeting?
Sorry, Don.
( Cow moos )
Don't get no fresher than that.
Who wants to try it?
I will.
- Really? - Sure.
See how warm it is?
It's sweet.
Don.
Where the hell were you?
- Had an early lunch. - I can smell it.
I didn't know you were gonna b*at me here.
You could have told somebody. Anybody.
I don't have to tell anybody. That's my name on the door out there.
This is my agency. I'm the president of this agency.
I don't have to ask anybody anything.
You know what? I could call a holiday for the whole office right now.
I've been sitting in here waiting for you.
I'm not gonna slink out of here with my tail between my legs.
- Now call a damn meeting. - Let me ask Joan.
- Don't ask Joan. - Wait here.
Chicken salad on rye and a Nesbitt's?
Yes, thank you, Dawn.
(children chattering )
You eat. I'm going to wash my hands.
Okay.
You can't sit there. That's my mom's spot.
Jim: Don?
Hello, Jim.
I'm surprised to see you.
Well, here I am.
Mr. Cutler, there you are.
I can go down to the lobby and sell newspapers,
but you're still gonna pay me.
- I have a two-year contract. - Calm down.
I'll find out what's going on and I'll take care of it.
What am I supposed to do?
Just hide while he sits down there
cooling his heels like Longfellow Deeds?
We're going to ask him to leave.
May I?
Be careful. I've seen this before.
You might want to call security.
A lot of bees over there.
They live in drawers.
- Where's my sandwich? - What do you mean?
There were two.
I traded it.
- You traded it? - With Susie Rogers.
She didn't have a sandwich.
I got her gumdrops.
Bobby, that was my lunch.
I'm sorry. I'll go get it back.
Stop it. It's fine.
- I'm sorry. - Sit down.
I'm sorry.
I swear I didn't know you were going to eat.
There were two sandwiches.
You want them?
No. You eat them.
But I don't want them.
Eat your candy.
Your shoes.
What about her?
I just discovered you're our best hope
to explain why Don Draper is downstairs.
He came to me in remorse and said he's ready to come back.
Oh, I see.
Well, unfortunately, we fired him.
No, we didn't.
We deliberately put him on leave in this very room.
We didn't fire him. I would never agree to that.
The leave of absence was a very clear message.
We were allowing him to preserve his dignity
while seeking other employment.
Ah.
Well, I remember clearly that Cutler said
the leave of absence was to give him time to think.
I didn't want any more rancor.
Is that what you thought? That we fired him?
Not necessarily, but I did expect
to revisit the topic after some time as a group.
Well, here we are. Let's take a vote.
- I'll speak for Ted. - And I'll speak for Pete.
All I can say is that Don is a very talented man,
but how does he fit into everything now?
This is working.
Besides, we're still mopping up the damage he's done.
I do not like the way this agency is spoken of out there.
You don't think that's because our creative is invisible right now?
One nomination.
Lou didn't put in anything he couldn't tag his name on.
He barely worked here last year.
Lou is adequate.
I think it's more important we discuss Harry Crane.
Harry Crane?
He's gone. Anything else?
This agency is too dependent on creative personalities.
You're still talking for Ted?
If we want people speaking about this agency,
what they should be speaking about is our media department.
We need to invest in a computer, period.
We need to tell our clients we're thinking about the future,
not creative hijinks.
Don is a genius.
He's costing us a fortune!
- You hate him. - I don't!
I hate what he did to Ted.
Enough! This is a financial decision.
Obviously, it's not.
Right now Don draws a sizable salary
and has a partnership stake.
That costs more than a computer.
- He has a contract. - He's in breach.
No, he's not. He's on leave!
And even if we do fire him, he's a partner.
We have to buy him out.
That's true.
That's a big hit.
As tough as it is, I'm confident
it'll be more profitable in the long term.
Since when are you allowed to use the words "long term" in this office?
It'll be 1973 before we're even.
We fire him, we lose the noncompete.
You want to walk down some hotel hallway
and see Mary Wells sitting on Don's lap the next time you go in to present?
( TV playing )
How was the farm?
How was your day?
Did you eat?
I'm not hungry.
I was hungry, but now I'm not.
It was a long day.
I'm going to give Gene a bath.
Come on, Genie.
What happened?
I wish it was yesterday.
- Man: Have a good night. - Woman: Good night, George.
(phone ringing)
How was your day?
That remains to be seen.
Are you coming back?
I thought so.
Now I'm not so sure.
Well, I can't say that we miss you.
Thank you, Peggy.

What happened?
I couldn't get it out of Bobby.
It was a perfect day and he ruined it.
How is that possible, Betty?
Do you think I'm a good mother?
Of course.
Then why don't they love me?
What are you talking about?
Look at him.
It's just a matter of time.
Mr. Draper.
Yes. Dawn...
can I get some coffee?
Of course, but they want to see you in the conference room--
the partners.
Oh.
Hello, everyone.
Come on, sit down.
- Bert, how are you? - Capital.
Well, this is the meeting I assumed you were going to have
before I came, Roger.
Sorry if I disrupted your day,
but I've had a productive time catching myself up with everything.
Well, we've discussed it and we've reached the conclusion
that we'd like you to come back to work.
I'm pleased to hear that.
But there are some stipulations.
Violation of which will result in termination
and a reabsorption of your partnership shares.
You are not allowed to be alone with clients.
You are to stick to the script in meetings
and that means the script will be approved
by the people in this room.
Outside of client hospitality, there will be no drinking in the office.
You'll be in Lane's old office.
And you will report to Lou.
Okay.
