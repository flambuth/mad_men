Dawn Chambers, please.
( Phone rings)
- Dawn Chambers.- Im glad I caught you.
I need ribbonfor my typewriter.
Its a Coronet.
And I have letterhead,but I could use a ream of onionskin.
Okay.
And I wrote a letterto Fritz over at Leica.
Im going to needan airmail envelope.
I can get thesesent over to you right now.
- Just bring them with you.- Mr. Draper, Im swamped.
I have to get a schedule outfor a sh**t.
So you can come a little later.What are you sh**ting?
- Mountain Dew.- Oh.
What is it?
Um, its called "Invisible Boy."
Its this kid--
Ginsberg finally got that through.
I guess so.
Anyway, Mr. Draper, I can geta messenger to you in 20 minutes,
unless youre going out.
Obviously I didntmake any plans.
I was expecting youto come over.
Were there any calls?
- ( Phone ringing)- Just Mr. Alan Silver
from the Paul Kohner Agencyin Los Angeles.
Can you get him on the line?
Im sorry, my phoneis ringing off the hook.
I hope its okay.He says you have his number.
Or I can give it to you again.
No, Dawn, I want youto call him.
I, uh-- can you hold?
Don Draper for Alan Silver.
Don.Glad I caught you.
I was beginningto give up hope.
How can I help you?
Its a bit of a casting issue.
I dont know if I canhelp you with that.
Well, it has to do with our girl.
And Im probably overreacting,
but youre the closest thingto a manager
and, lets face it, you probablyhave more influence.
( laughs )You better.
Just get to it, Alan.
Megan went into an audition
and performed adequatelyfrom what I can tell
and by the time she gotto the parking lot
decided to call casting
and ask if she could come back inand do it differently.
So shes persistent.
On Sunday she gotthe directors number
from someone in her acting class,called his home,
then managed to run into himat the Brentwood Country Mart
while he was having lunchwith Rod Serling.
She met Rod Serling?
I dont even knowif she knew he was there.
She apparently pledher case in tears
and demanded another reading.
Why would she do that?
Its not like Ive neverseen this before.
They lose their confidence.
But I dont want anyoneto have that anecdote.
Its best we nip this in the bud.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
You know her better than I do.
I tried to talk to her,but she hung up.
You have to tell her to relax.
She really is doing wellas the new girl in town.
Yeah.
Well, then, I dont want to take upany more of your precious time.
Yeah, thank you.
- ( Phone ringing)- ( approaching footsteps )
Its the Clios.Who cares?
I do, but you shouldntgive them the power
to decide who shall liveand who shall die.
Stan and I are part of the agencyand Playtex is our client.
Wed feel the sameif it was the other way around.
Would you describe thatas patronizing?
Im not taking anythingaway from anybody.
But Im not going to dobetter work than St. Josephs.
Lous finishing his call.
Youll get em next year.
I gave that accountto you when I left.
I worked Playtex for years.
Well, maybe youdidnt work it right.
Lou:Send in the cavalry.
Morning.
Mr. Draper, good morning.
A weekday?What a treat.
Nice to see you, Tricia.
No briefcase?
Im going to surprise my wife.
Ive said it before--I hate her.
What can I get you?
Tomato juice.
Freeze-frame as our stallionruns through the background.
The bottle appears.
Announcer--"Chevalier Noir.
More horsepower."
Why is there artwork?
Well, I believe it really helpsif you see it.
You understand every hourhe works costs money?
You cant be hypothetical.
- It took a second, Lou.- Stay out of it, Rizzo.
Its already done.Would you just look at it?
Who put a knotin your pantyhose?
Shes upset becauseI got nominated for a Clio
and "Rosemarys Baby"didnt.
I dont care about awards.
Oh, sorry, Peggy.
Jim pulled itbecause St. Josephs
was still unhappyabout going over budget
and all the awardsTeds already won for them.
Theyre upset about winning?
You know clients hate awards.
Thats why Ogilvy never submits.
He does it for the clients.Trust me.
Wasnt Ogilvy the chairmanof the Clios last year?
Thats comforting--you werent rejected.
You werent even considered.
- Are we finished?- Sorry about that.
- You want to go to color?- Ask your boss.
Im usually by his side.
The real challenge in our life has beentrying to get Rockys attention.
Rocky.
I told you last time to tell himthat Im an admirer.
( Chuckles )
After Henrypatched things up,
hed hoped to be onthe short list for AG.
Attorney general.
But I shouldnt betalking about this.
How are things in real estate?
Im a travel agent, Betty.
But youre still going to takethat exam again, arent you?
No, its going swimmingly.
Im in the officethree days a week now.
"Wanderlust Travel."
- Thats spicy.- Take a few.
Im sure youll need them.
Henrys secretarytakes care of all that.
But she still has to bookthrough somebody.
Trust me, its not all about breakingthe rack rate on a hotel room.
Its about perfection.
One of my clients told methat I redefined
his definition of first class.
Three days a week in an office.
Whats that like?
Its a little shopping centerin Dobbs Ferry.
Just a storefront, really.A bunch of desks.
Everybodys on the phoneall the time,
so you have to keepone finger in your ear.
I have three phonesand no secretary.
Sometimes I cant turn my neckwhen I get home.
Doesnt Carlton complain?
He likes the money.
He wants me to let the girl go,and I probably should.
Ernie and Jennyare walking to school now.
Well, Genes a few yearsaway from that.
Oh, your times occupied.
But for the rest of us,
as they get older,theres less and less to do.
Being alone in the houseall that time.
I really needed a challenge.
Well, theres still plentyof challenges ahead, believe me.
Fine, I needed a reward.
I thought they were the reward.
I dont know.Maybe Im old-fashioned.
Betty Draper, that is indeedhow I would describe you.
I want that streusel coffee cake.Will you split?
Of course.
Well, hello.How are you doing, Tom?
- Randall.- Good.
Our good friends at Koss here,and frankly Ill include myself,
have a few questions for you.
Id love to explain anything.
I think its the media planwe agreed upon.
No.
Its about this articlefrom a few weeks back.
Yes, Ive seen this,obviously.
Im very happywith our media plan,
but Grey has this computerthat theyre opening up to everybody.
We just thought maybewe should look into it.
Or you should.
Look, may I sit down?
This is a very enviable piece of PR.
Grey gets "The New York Times"to tell all about their computer
by offering their servicesup to the world.
But I swear, as clever as it is,its just PR.
Im an engineer.
You can explain to mewhat the difference is
between their computerand your computer.
Well, computers dont think.People do.
And the data accumulatedby me and my department
reflects the samenational availability of media.
What we will be able to offer soonis local data as well.
We will be able to integrate localand national markets into one report.
We are developing that program.
There you have it.
Youll forgive me,
but Greys does soundvery impressive.
Theyre a different kind of agency.
I wasnt even invited to this meetingbecause this is about your business.
Koss, thats the only namethat should be in the paper.
Very well put.
Tom, does that put you at ease?
Im really sorryto put you through that.
Randy warned me,but, you know, I got to ask.
( laughs )
Ill walk you out.
You said you wanted to pokeyour head in and say hi to Peggy?
Its good to see you.Got to get you out on that boat.
Thank you, Jim.Harry, always a pleasure.
What are you smiling about?
Did you not call for a fireman?
Why the hell is Grey Advertisingcoming up in my meeting?
Well, that articlecould have been about us
if anyone appreciatedour media department.
Are you aware your self-pityis distasteful?
You know what?This conversation is over.
Im really not interested.
( Car approaches )
Hello.
Youre here!You surprised me!
Maybe I got your hints.
Ive never, ever admittedthat I wanted this.
What happened?Did you get fired?
I just had a hankering.
Really?
Well, an extra special hankeringyou shall get.
( TV playing )
Hello.
Loretta, please.
Theyre not watching.
No, I believe theyre notinterested in that.
Arent you helping Bobbywith his homework?
Yes, maam.
You got to sign this slipfor Bobbys field trip.
How was everyone today?
Theyre little angels.
Theyre looking for chaperones.I can take Genie along.
Well, if you can rememberto turn this in, I want to go along.
You do?Youre gonna come?
Yes.Yes, lam.
Great.Its Miss Keysers dads farm.
She grew up thereand they make butter and grow eggs.
Well, well see all that,wont we?
Im going to change.
I really needed that.
I really needed this.
So I could have been anyone.
Its your own fault.
I think Ive been alone too much.
You have so many friends,I cant keep track.
I dont know.
(Sighs)
Its sunny herefor everyone but me.
Im walking aroundin a cloud of "no."
Megan, you know,theyre getting rejected, too.
Maybe theyre justhandling it better.
Thats a terrible thing to say.
Im speaking from experience.
You cant let it erodeyour confidence.
And you cant get angryor desperate.
I know that.
I know all that.
What the hell are you doing here?
Alan called me.
What?He called you?
Im your husband.He was worried.
Great, now l have to fire him.
What am I gonna do?How am I gonna find someone new?
You dont have to fire anyone.
You just have to stop actinglike a lunatic.
What did he say?
You know what?Forget it.
So you came out here to what?
Pull me out of a bathtubwhere I slit my wrists?
Ill admit it, I was worried.
Well, thanks for the visit, Daddy.
I was stupid for thinkingyou could possibly miss me.
I do miss you.
No, you dont.
I should fly in and surprise you.
Yeah, thats a scary thought,isnt it?
- No.- Really?
Youre never there when I call
and you alwayshave to call me back.
And its always quiet.
Where is it quiet in that office?
And Ive never even hearda typewriter.
- Thats not true.- Yes, it is true.
Im sorry I had to interruptyour love affairs
with the disaster of my career.
Megan, sit down.
I was your secretary,remember?
I know what youre likewhen youre left alone.
- Youre acting crazy.- So where are you?
Why cant I reach you?Whos your new girl, Don?
There is no one else.
Ive been at home.
They put me on leave, okay?
You lost your job?
Dont worry,Im still getting paid.
I dont give a shit.When did this happen?
Right after you left.
They fired you last year?
I didnt get fired.Thats the thing.
I dont know if they want meor they dont want me.
Why didnt you tell me?
Because I messed up
and I didnt want you to knowuntil I fixed it.
And there is no one else.Ive been good.
I havent even beendrinking that much.
So with a clear head,
you got up every dayand decided
that you didntwant to be with me?
Megan.
(Sighs)
Mm, Im not walkingout of my own house.
So that means you have to leave.
Have you calmed down?
Im not kidding around.
I want you to call a cab,get on a plane, go home.
I dont want you to worryabout me anymore.
- Stop it.- Its okay, Don.
This is the way it ends.
Its going to be so mucheasier for both of us.
- ( Intercom buzzes)- Woman: I have Mr. Grady calling.
Hes from"The Wall Street Journal."
Really?Put him through.
( Phone rings)
Ahem, Harold Crane here.
We have a situation.
I know this isnt the message,
but we can all learn somethingfrom the funeral business.
Did you tell "The Wall Street Journal"to give me a call?
(Sighs)
I felt badly about diminishingyour contributions
in this mornings meeting.
And lets face it, this computersituation is an arms race.
Theres no point in winningif people dont know.
Well, were not winning.We dont have a computer.
What?
Believe me, I ask for oneevery Christmas
and no one even bothers to say no.
Well, why did you tellthe client we do?
Its semantics.
We use a computer,therefore I call it our computer.
But its actuallysomeone elses computer.
And the local markets program?
Its a great idea.
Im sure someonesgoing to do that.
You have stiff competition,but I believe you to be
the most dishonest manI have ever worked with.
I didnt call"The Wall Street Journal."
k*ll it.
(phone ringing)
- Woman: Dave Woosters office.- ls Dave in?
Its Clarence Birdseye calling.
Just a minute.Let me see if hes available.
Dave:Well, hello, Don.
Enough dancing around.Lets have dinner.
Hows tonight?
7:30.The Algonquin.
( Exhales )
Well, while were digesting,
perhaps you should doa little digesting.
You can look at it nowor you can put it in your pocket,
but you cant use itas a coaster.
Why dont you justtell me whats in it?
Why dont you look?
- Thats coy.- No, thats drama.
Woman:Excuse me.
Im sure you caught my eyeduring dinner.
I was only staring because I believewe know each other.
Emily Arnett?
Im afraid I cant place you.
Im sorry.
I dont meanto interrupt anything.
Would you like to join us?
No, Im off to bed.
Hopefully Ill be able to sleep.
Im on the top floorright next to the elevator.
Well, its a pleasureto meet you.
Have a good night.
Who was she?
Fellas, theres no needfor the hard sell.
We had nothing to do with that.
I wish Id thought of it.
Should we get another drinkor do you have someplace to be?
( Chuckles )
( knocks )
Hello.
What are you doing here?
Are you alone?
For the time being.
I came by because I hada quick question.
- sh**t.- How do you sleep at night?
You know what?I called you at Christmas.
Im sorry I opened the door.I was expecting a BLT.
Why would I want to talk to youwhen you fired me?
I got the message."Merry Christmas, love, Judas."
What is this?
Thats a nice offer.
Theyre really trying to make it soundlike its not a demotion.
So I take the job?Thats your advice?
If thats what you want to do.
Well, I know what you want me to do.Go away.
I guess you dont rememberI started that company.
I had to talk you into it.
I guess you forgot I found youat the bottom of a fur box.
I would never havedone that to you.
Oh, come on.Dont be a big baby about it.
You were a disaster.We did you a favor.
The man who talked to Hershey?
Ive seen that man wanderingthe streets with a sandwich board
saying "The end is near."
- So I have my answer.- I didnt know the question?
You want to come back?Come back.
I miss you.
( Knocking on door)
- Who is it?- Sherry: Room service.
Oh.
I didnt know we had company.
Yeah, for once,its a friend of mine.
Sherry, this is Don.
I was just leaving.
Come in Monday.
(phone ringing)
- Megan: Hello?- Its me.
Hello.
I wanted to hear your voice.
I dont have a lot to say.
Then you can just listen.
I...
I shouldnt have lied to you.
And Im sorry.
And I want everythingto be okay.
(Sighs)
Are you there?
Yes.
I can see now that I wasnt...
thinking clearly
and I had this logicto what I did and...
hopefully now...
things can be the waywe want them to be
because Im going backto the agency.
Good for you.
I dont know if I can undo it,but I think I fixed it.
"I fixed it"is you got a job out here.
Thats what you promised me.Thats why Im here.
I just thought that if you found outwhat happened...
you wouldnt look at mein the same way.
I cant believe after all this timeyou dont know me.
I know how I want youto see me.
Dont lie to me.
Dont do that.
You cant do that.
Im your wife.
Stop pushing me awaywith both hands.
I could come back out.
I have the weekend.
( Sniffles )
(Sighs)
Not now.
Its not a good idea.
I love you.
Good night.
Theres basically Frankenstein,Dracula, Wolf Man,
the Mummy, and the Creaturefrom the Black Lagoon.
- Thats quite a few.- Theres also King Kong, too,
but hes not really a monster.
I like all of them, but I guessWolf Mans my favorite
because he changes into it.
Dracula changes into a bat.
Thats true.
16, 18...
Its nice to seesomebody getting along.
We were having a conversation.
Thank you so muchfor helping out.
( Bus thumps)
Makes my job so much easier.
Bobby askedand I couldnt say no.
My mom loves animals.
She really likes you.
Yes, well, that blousesays she likes everyone.
Its Lou, right?
Oh, hello there.
Good to see you.
Sure.
How are you, Don?
Ready to get back to work.
Good for you.
Hello there.
Oh, Don!Look at you.
- How are you?- Im good.
Its been too long.
Here I am.
Why dont you let metake that up to him?
( laughs )To Roger?
No, hes not in yet.Thats mine.
Do you want some?
When do you expect him?I think we have a meeting.
Im always the last to know.
Its fine.
Ill keep myself occupied.
Great to see you again.
Keep that.
- Is Jim Cutler in yet?- I think hes at breakfast.
I dont care if hes in bedwith Joey Heatherton.
Get him on the horn.
Ginsberg:Don?
Is that you?
Hello, Michael.
Ed, come here.Look whos here.
Oh, hi, Don.Great to see you.
Boy, you smell good.
Hey, you know what?Are you busy?
- What do you mean?- Dont bother him.


Hell know.Come here.
Chevalier Blanchas started Chevalier Noir.
Thats "night," or "black."
Either way,its the opposite of Blanc.
And were supposedto work up print
based on this voiceover tagline,"More horsepower."
And you gotta see the words,but it ends with a freeze-frame.
What does?
The TV spot.
Oh. I assumeyou have storyboards.
Exit stage left.
What have you been up to, Don?
Just R&R mostly.
Do you want to seethe strategy?
Sure.
What happened to the storyboardsfrom Chevalier Noir?
She gave them to Lou.
What do I do?Don wants to see em.
- Don?- Don-- Draper.
Says who?
Says him.Hes outside.
Right now?Whats he doing here?
You want I should ask him?
Whats he doing?
Who cares?
- Whats going on?- Shh! Look.
What is he doing here?
Maybe he finished drying out.
Meredith, we betterget back to work.
Hello, Don.
Hello, Stan.
Where you been?Riding the rails?
- Turns out Lous got the boards.- Its fine.
Mr. Draper.
Morning, Dawn.
Seems to be some lapsein communication
regarding my return.
No one told me.
Could you just let me know whensomeone tracks down Mr. Sterling?
- Can I get some coffee?- Certainly.
Why dont you fellascatch me up?
You want me to get everything?
Whatever you got handy.
Lets start with the garbage.
( Cow moos )
Children, this is my father,Farmer Cy.
You can call me Cyrusor Cy or "hey, mister."
( laughs )
If you look around,you can see pigs
and goats and chickens.
And Pammys favorite,the horsies.
Weve got all the animals.
But this farm is mostlyfor growing potatoes,
so theres not a lotabove ground.
But I know youre all hereto see the cows.
So why dont we walk this way?
Im sorry, ladies,but theres no smoking in the barn.
Ill be along.
Youre not afraid of missing themmilk the cow?
Ill be done in a minute.
Well, I hope no one accidentallygrabs on the wrong udders.
Excuse me?
Farmers daughter needs a bra.
( laughs )
( clicking )
- Mm-hmm.- Do you need my lighter?
Would you mind?
Don?ls that you?
Boys, excuse me a minute.
Don, what a pleasant surprise.
Youre looking well, Joan.
What have you been up to?What are you doing here?
- Waiting.- For what?
You two just getting in?
We had a breakfast meeting.
What are you doing here?
I guess Im waiting for Roger.
Oh, I see.
Well...
it was nice seeing you.
Guess what.Cynthia had a little boy.
Edward,but we call him Eddie.
Eddie Cosgrove.
Thats the carouselin Central Park.
Always makes me think of you.
Now I knowwhat youll look like bald.
( laughs )
( knocks )May I have a word?
Dont linger in the door.
Im wearing boots.
Yes, fine, dear.
Did you know thatDon Draper is downstairs?
Doing what?
He says hes waiting for Roger.Does that ring a bell?
He shouldnt be here.
So obviously I would liketo get married,
but, you know, I dontreally have any savings.
I mean, it doesnt make any senseto borrow money from my parents
just so I look successfulin front of hers, does it?
I dont know.That is a tough spot.
What the hell is going on in here?
We were just catching up.
Thats nice, ladies.You four, in my office.
- We have that meeting.- What meeting?
Sorry, Don.
( Cow moos )
Dont get no fresher than that.
Who wants to try it?
I will.
- Really?- Sure.
See how warm it is?
Its sweet.
Don.
Where the hell were you?
- Had an early lunch.- I can smell it.
I didnt know youwere gonna b*at me here.
You could have told somebody.Anybody.
I dont have to tell anybody.Thats my name on the door out there.
This is my agency.Im the president of this agency.
I dont have to askanybody anything.
You know what? I could call a holidayfor the whole office right now.
Ive been sitting in herewaiting for you.
Im not gonna slink out of herewith my tail between my legs.
- Now call a damn meeting.- Let me ask Joan.
- Dont ask Joan.- Wait here.
Chicken salad on ryeand a Nesbitts?
Yes, thank you, Dawn.
(children chattering )
You eat.Im going to wash my hands.
Okay.
You cant sit there.Thats my moms spot.
Jim:Don?
Hello, Jim.
Im surprised to see you.
Well, here I am.
Mr. Cutler, there you are.
I can go down to the lobbyand sell newspapers,
but youre still gonna pay me.
- I have a two-year contract.- Calm down.
Ill find out whats going onand Ill take care of it.
What am I supposed to do?
Just hidewhile he sits down there
cooling his heelslike Longfellow Deeds?
Were going to ask him to leave.
May I?
Be careful.Ive seen this before.
You might want to call security.
A lot of bees over there.
They live in drawers.
- Wheres my sandwich?- What do you mean?
There were two.
I traded it.
- You traded it?- With Susie Rogers.
She didnt have a sandwich.
I got her gumdrops.
Bobby, that was my lunch.
Im sorry.Ill go get it back.
Stop it.Its fine.
- Im sorry.- Sit down.
Im sorry.
I swear I didnt knowyou were going to eat.
There were two sandwiches.
You want them?
No. You eat them.
But I dont want them.
Eat your candy.
Your shoes.
What about her?
I just discoveredyoure our best hope
to explain whyDon Draper is downstairs.
He came to me in remorseand said hes ready to come back.
Oh, I see.
Well, unfortunately,we fired him.
No, we didnt.
We deliberately put him on leavein this very room.
We didnt fire him.I would never agree to that.
The leave of absencewas a very clear message.
We were allowing himto preserve his dignity
while seekingother employment.
Ah.
Well, I remember clearlythat Cutler said
the leave of absencewas to give him time to think.
I didnt want any more rancor.
Is that what you thought?That we fired him?
Not necessarily,but I did expect
to revisit the topicafter some time as a group.
Well, here we are.Lets take a vote.
- Ill speak for Ted.- And Ill speak for Pete.
All I can say is that Donis a very talented man,
but how does he fitinto everything now?
This is working.
Besides, were still mopping upthe damage hes done.
I do not like the way this agencyis spoken of out there.
You dont think thats becauseour creative is invisible right now?
One nomination.
Lou didnt put in anythinghe couldnt tag his name on.
He barely worked here last year.
Lou is adequate.
I think its more importantwe discuss Harry Crane.
Harry Crane?
Hes gone.Anything else?
This agency is too dependenton creative personalities.
Youre still talking for Ted?
If we want peoplespeaking about this agency,
what they should be speaking aboutis our media department.
We need to investin a computer, period.
We need to tell our clientswere thinking about the future,
not creative hijinks.
Don is a genius.
Hes costing us a fortune!
- You hate him.- I dont!
I hate what he did to Ted.
Enough!This is a financial decision.
Obviously, its not.
Right now Don drawsa sizable salary
and has a partnership stake.
That costs more than a computer.
- He has a contract.- Hes in breach.
No, hes not.Hes on leave!
And even if we do fire him,hes a partner.
We have to buy him out.
Thats true.
Thats a big hit.
As tough as it is,Im confident
itll be more profitablein the long term.
Since when are you allowed to usethe words "long term" in this office?
Itll be 1973 before were even.
We fire him,we lose the noncompete.
You want to walk downsome hotel hallway
and see Mary Wells sitting on Dons lapthe next time you go in to present?
( TV playing )
How was the farm?
How was your day?
Did you eat?
Im not hungry.
I was hungry,but now Im not.
It was a long day.
Im going to give Gene a bath.
Come on, Genie.
What happened?
I wish it was yesterday.
- Man: Have a good night.- Woman: Good night, George.
(phone ringing)
How was your day?
That remains to be seen.
Are you coming back?
I thought so.
Now Im not so sure.
Well, I cant saythat we miss you.
Thank you, Peggy.
( TV playing )
What happened?
I couldnt get it out of Bobby.
It was a perfect dayand he ruined it.
How is that possible, Betty?
Do you think Im a good mother?
Of course.
Then why dont they love me?
What are you talking about?
Look at him.
Its just a matter of time.
Mr. Draper.
Yes. Dawn...
can I get some coffee?
Of course, but they want to see youin the conference room--
the partners.
Oh.
Hello, everyone.
Come on, sit down.
- Bert, how are you?- Capital.
Well, this is the meeting I assumedyou were going to have
before I came, Roger.
Sorry if I disrupted your day,
but Ive had a productive timecatching myself up with everything.
Well, weve discussed itand weve reached the conclusion
that wed like youto come back to work.
Im pleased to hear that.
But there are some stipulations.
Violation of whichwill result in termination
and a reabsorptionof your partnership shares.
You are not allowedto be alone with clients.
You are to stickto the script in meetings
and that means the scriptwill be approved
by the people in this room.
Outside of client hospitality,there will be no drinking in the office.
Youll be in Lanes old office.
And you will report to Lou.
Okay.
