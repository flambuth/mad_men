- Evening, Mr. Draper.- Hello, Dawn.
- Let me take your coat.- Its 8:00. Do you mind?
What is this?
SweetN Low and Coffee-Mate.I noticed you were out.
Is this an elaborate plea for coffee?I can make some.
I really cant stay.
Mrs. Draper did notcall this morning,
but I arranged for a Valentinebouquet to arrive
in the afternoon her time,so Id expect a call here around dinner.
Good girl.
Mohawk Airlines?Henry Lammott came in?
He just dropped in.He wanted to meet Lou.
Huh.Office or conference room?
- Conference room.- Where did he sit?
- Who?- Lou.
I dont remember.
How did Diners Clubgo on Tuesday?
It got pushed back fora signing meeting with Handi-Wrap.
More Dow?How long has that been going on?
I dont know.Its Mr. Cosgrove.
Claras terrible with memos.
- What creative team is on it?- I dont know.
- No other calls?- No, Mr. Draper.
I know, I know.I told you, its for carfare.
Well, Ive been thinkingabout it a lot, actually.
And you know I dont mindkeeping you aware of things.
But theres something about the moneythat makes it feel wrong.
Youre doing extra work.You should get extra pay.
Its no work at all.
So I will continue to dowhat I feel comfortable doing for free,
which is answer your phoneand keep you up to date.
Thats all I ask for.
No, you asked me to get youphotocopies of the Butler work
and theyre lockedin Peggys office and I cant.
I dont want you to do that.
All right.Good.
But I want you to take this.
- You take care.- Of course.
The cleaning womancomes tomorrow morning.
( Sighs )
( TV turns on )
Carol: She says, "You looklike a working girl."
And I thought she meant I lookedlow-class like a secretary.
But Petra saidshe meant a prostitute.
How the f*ck does my mother knowwhat a prostitute looks like?
How was Sarah?
Below average.
She wants meto bring her Capezios,
so I dont knowwhat Im going to wear.
Is it an open casket?
I didnt ask.
Sergeant Snorkel says we haveto come back on the 12:30.
So back here by 3:00?
The funerals at 9:00.
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.
Maybe we leave a little earlybecause Sallys so upset.
We get in a taxi to the cemetery,
but we get outin Greenwich Village.
Two hours of shopping,take another pumpkin to Grand Central.
Theres a boutique on MacDougalthat has Pocahontas boots.
I am upset, Carol.
Me, too.I heard her dads a mess.
She was supposed to bea great beauty.
Sarah had this picture of herwearing a bikini on Christmas.
She took it with her.
You know shes gonnamiss school till Easter?
I wish my mom was dead.
Id stay here till 1975 if I couldget Betty in the ground.
What are you wearing?
I dont have anything blackbut my turtleneck,
so I thought Id wear that withmy brown suede skirt and black tights.
Jesus, Draper.ls this your first funeral?
(laughing)
Leave the lights off.
How am I gonna find anything?
Why do you haveto do this tonight?
- Hey.- Didnt you already sign Chevy?
Cant you just add the businessonto their other contract?
Sweetheart, let meexplain this to you.
This is the Southern CaliforniaChevrolet Dealers Association.
Chevys the factory,this is the store.
Youre not listening to me.
Just has to be therewhen he wakes up.
Hes so drunk, he doesnteven know where he is.
Thats why it has to be therewhen he wakes up
with a note that says,
"You promised to sign thisno matter what."
( moans )
You are such a big deal.
( Door opens )
Howd it go?
- I got em.- Good work.
- Good night, Bonnie.- Good night.
- ( Door closes )- ( both laughing )
( elevator bell dings )
Peggy:Hold that, please.
- Hello, New York.- Howdy.
Oh, Michael,very nice work on Butler.
Stan, were going to needrenderings, color.
( Elevator bell dings )
- Hows Monday?- Today is Friday.
Whew, Im buried all dayand I have plans tonight.
So you can finish tonightand have plans all weekend.
- Shes gonna find out.- What?
( Sighs )
Maybe if you invite me,you can have till Tuesday.
We now all know you dont haveplans for Valentines Day.
Oh.
She has plans.Look at her calendar.
"February 14,masturbate gloomily."
- ( elevator bell dings )- Monday is fine.
Who are these from?
Hard to believeyour cat has the money.
Really lovely.
Look at you,every inch a girl.
Is this some kind of joke?
Just tell me now because I dont wantto have to fire you later.
Enjoy your flowers, boss.
Oh.
Happy Valentines Day, Shirley.
And happyValentines Day to you.
Shirley, I see theres no card,
but Id like to know who sent methese beautiful flowers.
Well, actually--
Oh.
Oh.
I understand now.
Oh, good.
Could you get me some coffee?
What time is it on the coast?
- Pardon?- 6:00 a.m.
Ill handle it.
Could you get the door?
( Phone rings )
Ted Chaoughs office.
Good morning, Moira.Its Peggy.
Where are you?
Im in my office, but I need youto relay a message to Ted for me.
Oh, okay.
Tell him thatI got his message.
No, tell him thatI relayed his message
to the client and...
And what?
Theres nothing he can do.
Theyre not--
they dont want to hearany more pitches.
The business is gone.
Really?What account?
Hell know.
Well, the snows melted,but not the hearts of New Yorkers.
I just had some old ladycall me a "kike."
- ls that right?- Yeah.
She was lettingher dog relieve himself
and I said, "Pardon me,but you want to curb that thing?"
She says, "Mindyour own business, kike."
( laughs )Maybe its the hat.
The strangest thingshappen to you.
Hey, did you see this?
Ogilvy signed Hershey.
I hadnt heard that.
( Man speaking on P.A. )
She hates her becauseshe got a C in Western Civ.
She corrects my English.
I went to school in England.
Are we going to walkinto school with these?
Well say theyre Sarahs.
Is my purse in your bag?
The senior class sent her flowersbecause theyre all so concerned.
Half of them thinkher name is Sally.
Shit, I must have left itat the coffee shop.
Maybe in the head shop?
Im just going to go upand check at the counter.
- Ill get your fare.- No, my address book is in there.
- Its everybody I know.- We cant wait.
Theres another trainin a couple hours.
- "Hello, Dawn."- "Hello, Shirley."
You shouldnt be taking a breakright where you are.
Im not. Im getting her coffee.And Im taking my time.
- ( Chuckles ) What did she do now?- It aint funny.
Charles sent me 12 long-stem rosesin a crystal vase
and she took em.
I was right at the photocopierwhen she came in
preparing her shit,and somehow--
cause I put the cardin my purse,
I guess because it said,"I love you so"--
she thought they were hers.
Well, it was an honest mistake.
Who the hellis sending her flowers?
(laughs)
Why didnt you say something?
It was too late.I tried.
- You tried?- I really did.
Well, theyre hers now.
Im gonna tell her.
You want those flowers so bad,
youll take the trouble that comeswith getting them back?
Its not right.
Well, I have two bosses
and one of them hasnt toldhis wife hes on leave.
Keep pretending.
Thats your job.
Well, you know who I feelthe worst for is Charles.
Hed rather you have a job.
You know thats not true.
"Happy Valentines, Dawn."
"Good-bye, Shirley."
Dave:You look good. Rested.
You said that.How do I usually look?
Its just that youve been so busyfor the last two years,
youve nevertaken me up for lunch.
I figured youre onsome kind of break.
Maybe Im doing research.
Maybe I want our place to be a littlebit more like Wells Rich Greene.
Youd have to have Mary.
And, you know,you probably could.
I knew you were gonna tell mehow great it is to work there,
but I didnt thinkthats where youd start.
So you lookingto make a change?
I have a job.
And I have a contractand a noncompete clause.
And Im a partner.
Look, I dont know what the truth isand I dont really care.
Someone said you weredabbling in the LA office
or managing your wifes career.
People say things.
Well, then you probablyheard the one
where you pulleda major boner in a meeting
and you cried or punchedsomebody or something
and that they cut you loose.
I didnt know I wasgonna be interrogated
by the Hootervilletelephone operator.
So its not true?
Youre spoiling the mood.
( Chuckles )
How about for a second date,we go see the Knicks?
Right on the floor.
Bradleys havingone hell of a season.
Thats a good idea.
Hello?
Can I help you, sweetheart?
Who are you?
Im Mr. Avery.You looking for casting?
No, Im looking for my dad,Donald Draper.
Uh, well, hes not here.
Did he change offices?
Perfect.
Look, honey, hes not here.
Hes probably at home.You should call him.
You know how to getan outside line?
Is Joan here?
Thats a good idea.Her office is right down there.
You know, I thinkeverybodys at lunch.
( slams )
Have a nice day.
So shes sitting thereon the conference table
Indian-stylein a dress and boots
like some kind of pervertedkindergarten teacher
and she says,"Well, thank you, Robert.
I know its the bestyou can do."
What did Bob do?
Accepted his death gracefully.
I see a sheep and a wolf.
But which is which?
- How are you, Don?- Great.
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.
We know each other.
So, Dave, how come youll have lunchwith Don and not with me?
Cause this is social.Hes not trying to buy us.
Well, what are youtrying to do, Don?
Are you taking lunches now?
No, Im just looking for love.
Well, on behalf of myself
and all the millionairesat McCann Erickson,
wed love a chance to tell youhow handsome you are.
Move along, Jim.
Tell Mary I picked up the check,because I just did.
I dont have to crapon McCann for you, do I?
I almost worked there.Twice.
But you didnt.
Here, I want you to have these.
It smells likean Italian funeral in there.
( Keys clicking )
So then dessert finallyarrives and the ladies,
on cue,depart to the toilets.
And as were standing,Honeywell leans in and says,
"I like what I see."
Now, I thought he was makinga ribald comment about my date,
but he followed upby suggesting
we retire to the bar,just the two of us.
Is this a partners meeting
or the most tediouswireless program Ive ever heard?
- ( Chuckles )- Pete: What?
What did he say?
- Were on the edge of our seats.-( laughing )
- Hello, New York?- Hes saying get to it, Pete.
- Did you kiss the man or not?- Fine.
Well, he didnt want to say itin front of the boys from Detroit,
but he wants usto handle his business.
He rules the SoCal dealershipswith an iron fist.
- Thats great.- Wonderful.
- Thats wonderful news.- It is, isnt it?
They want us to starton the summer sale.
Sign them right away.
Sit in his yard with a penif you have to.
Pete: Contract camewith the milkman.
Ill get Bob Benson to fly infrom Detroit for the signing.
We dont want the tailwagging the dog.
Theyre the Dealers Association.
They bill almostas much as Chevy does.
They are the dog.
- Hes right.- Just a minute.
Chevys our clientand theyre our entree to GM,
which bills more thaneverything on the planet.
I would tell Detroitweve got this opportunity
and I would askfor their blessing.
Look, when I brought in Chevy,
I got their very ownMikey OBrien laid.
Sorry, sweetheart.And it wasnt easy. Sorry again.
Pete caught him.Let Pete mount him.
Can we move on?
This phone call is alreadyeating into our fee.
Ted, werent you therewhen we signed Chevy?
Roger seems to have failedto get a head count.
I dont see any reasonto keep score.
Gentlemen,this is good news.
And I have no problemwith flying to Detroit
and briefing Boband all those--
Ill bring oranges.
- Ted? Are you there?- ( static hissing )
Hello, California?
- Dee, can you hear us?- Yes, I can.
- Dee?- ( sighs )
Whats wrong with you?I say up, you say down.
Im surprised youredisagreeing with me.
Its common sense.
I think they cant hear us.
We can hear you!
Pete can service the account,
but he will reportto our man in Detroit
where said partieswill be offered
the right of refusal.
I remember very clearlywhen Don and I signed Chevy.
Don who?
Our collective ex-wifewho still receives alimony?
- Hang up.- Pete: No.
Roger:This is a partners meeting.
Lets poll the partners,shall we?
- Aye.- Aye what?
I agree with Jim.
Moira, fix the phone.
I feel caught off guardby having a confrontation
over somethingthat seems rudimentary.
( Phone clicks )
They never said whichof Peggys accounts we lost.
Call me when you fixthe damn phone.
Let me try out there.
What difference couldthat possibly make?
I thought we were gonnaget a new one of these.
And why the hell arentwe in the conference room?
Do not go after him.
Moira, you can reach mein my office.
( TV playing )
Hello?
- ( TV turns off )- Marta?
Oh, I lookedeverywhere for you.
What are you doing here?
What happened?ls everything okay?
Obviously not.
- Where were you?- I was at the office.
What?
I wasnt feeling well.I left early.
What happened?
Does your motherknow where you are?
What? No.
Youre not supposedto be off campus.
My roommates mother diedand they let us go to the funeral,
but I lost my purse.
Oh. Im sorry to hear that.
I just need money for the train.
And I guess I needa note of excuse.
Ill drive you.
No, its okay.Youre not feeling well.
Ill be fine.
You really dont have to.
It looks like you havea lot of work to do.
Come on, itll be nice.Well take a drive.
Whats the notesupposed to say?
What?
Sally, what do I say?
Just tell the truth.
Where the hell were you?
I was getting your perfume.
- Drapers daughter showed up.- Sally was here?
I dont know her name.She was looking for him.
My Lord.What did you say?
I said hes probably at home.Its not my problem.
I have to call him.
Call him?
You have to call him?Okay.
Dont bother apologizingto me, I guess.
- Im very sorry.- ( slams )
Want to go before we go?
- ( Phone rings )- Im fine.
- Hello.- Its Dawn.
And Im really sorry.
I dont know what happened,
but Sally came into the officeand she talked to Lou.
- And what did he say?- I dont know.
But I wanted you to knowthat she might be on her way.
Okay.Thank you, Dawn.
Do you have to stay?
No.
Lets go.
Hello, Dawn.
Lou said he wanted to see me.
- Oh.- ( button clicks )
Lou, Joans here to see you.
Lou: Actually, I needto see the both of you.
Get the door.
When I generously agreed
to share Dawn herewith Don Draper,
it was for the purposesof his correspondence
and incoming phone calls,not cleaning up his messes.
One of those thingsis very time-consuming.
- What happened?- His daughter came by.
Why are we goingthrough all this?
I know you cant fire her.
Just move her to another partof the building.
Lou, I will take care of this.
- What do you mean by that?- I want my own girl.
- Come along, Dawn.- In a minute.
Obviously I can sayanything I want.
But you dont want to.
I skipped my lunchto buy your wife perfume.
If you had been thoughtfulenough to get her a gift
when I told you about it 10 days ago,I would have been here.
Do you understand?Its not my problem.
None of this has anythingto do with me.
Im sorry if I saidthe wrong thing.
Was that necessary?
When she comes backfrom the ladies,
have her hand over the keys.
New York is on the line.
Do you have to put themon the contraption?
Its just Mr. Sterling.
- This is Pete.- Its Roger.
I appreciate you fighting for me.
Well, Jim pled his case
and we decided its bestto keep the business,
but run it past Detroit.
- Which means Bob gets involved.- What?
Jim and I had a meaningfulconversation--
I heard your conversation.Youre full of it.
That is just the kind of weakness
that got us in this positionto begin with.
Let me just go to Detroit.Im sure--
...something to do with Bobor my feelings towards Bob,
but it really doesnt.
Its a chance for me to rectifymy status with those people.
And in the end, thats ourbest route to new business.
Dee:He disconnected.
- ( Sighs )- ( bangs )
Why even bring in an account?
Theyre just gonna take it away.
Sometimes I think maybe I died
and Im in some kind of...
I dont know if its heavenor hell or limbo.
But I dont seem to exist.
No one feels my existence.
Just cash the checks.Youre gonna die one day.
What youre supposed to say is,
"Hey, why dont we just startour own agency?"
At least the goal would be clear.
I mean, what am Iworking for here?
Theres two offices.
Yours is only slightlybetter than mine.
What am I supposed to do,work my way up to your office?
You can have my office.
No, that is not the point.
Cutler sent you out herebecause youre too moral.
He couldnt look you inthe face and be Machiavelli.
Thats not why Im here.
Why are you here?
All you do is answerthe phone and mope around.
You know what?
Were not talking anymore.
From now on, well bothpretend Im in New York.
( Door slams )
Joan wants us to switch desks.
Dont feel bad.Its not your fault.
I know.
Dont be sore,but Im really happy.


I need a box.
She wants youout front right now.
Okay.Well, just a few things.
He takes it lightwith two SweetN Lows.
Always put throughhis son Earl.
These three lines are Lous
and this one is Mr. Drapers.
Maybe I should get a pencil.
You know what?
Ill have Mr. Drapers callscome straight to me at reception.

Ive been thinking about itand I know its silly,
but could you pleasethrow these flowers away?
Why?
Im sorry, but theyre cursed.
No, theyre not.Theyre beautiful.
Look, I should havebought you flowers

Ill get you some new ones.

Well, excuse me if I dont seethe point right now.
I mean, I landed that whaleand New York just took it away.
And I realized if the systemsrigged against me,
I might as well enjoy myself.
I once sold a housefor $108,000.
Two weeks later, during escrow,it b*rned down.
I had driven this Okie couplearound for a year.
Bought lunches,
looked at picturesof their hideous children.

Might as well be Barstow.
