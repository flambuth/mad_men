- Evening, Mr. Draper. - Hello, Dawn.
- Let me take your coat. - It's 8:00. Do you mind?
What is this?
Sweet'N Low and Coffee-Mate. I noticed you were out.
Is this an elaborate plea for coffee? I can make some.
I really can't stay.
Mrs. Draper did not call this morning,
but I arranged for a Valentine bouquet to arrive
in the afternoon her time, so I'd expect a call here around dinner.
Good girl.
Mohawk Airlines? Henry Lammott came in?
He just dropped in. He wanted to meet Lou.
Huh. Office or conference room?
- Conference room. - Where did he sit?
- Who? - Lou.
I don't remember.
How did Diners Club go on Tuesday?
It got pushed back for a signing meeting with Handi-Wrap.
More Dow? How long has that been going on?
I don't know. It's Mr. Cosgrove.
Clara's terrible with memos.
- What creative team is on it? - I don't know.
- No other calls? - No, Mr. Draper.
I know, I know. I told you, it's for carfare.
Well, I've been thinking about it a lot, actually.
And you know I don't mind keeping you aware of things.
But there's something about the money that makes it feel wrong.
You're doing extra work. You should get extra pay.
It's no work at all.
So I will continue to do what I feel comfortable doing for free,
which is answer your phone and keep you up to date.
That's all I ask for.
No, you asked me to get you photocopies of the Butler work
and they're locked in Peggy's office and I can't.
I don't want you to do that.
All right. Good.
But I want you to take this.
- You take care. - Of course.
The cleaning woman comes tomorrow morning.
( Sighs )
( TV turns on )
Carol: She says, "You look like a working girl."
And I thought she meant I looked low-class like a secretary.
But Petra said she meant a prostitute.
How the f*ck does my mother know what a prostitute looks like?
How was Sarah?
Below average.
She wants me to bring her Capezios,
so I don't know what I'm going to wear.
Is it an open casket?
I didn't ask.
Sergeant Snorkel says we have to come back on the 12:30.
So back here by 3:00?
The funeral's at 9:00.
We see Sarah, boo-hoo.
Maybe we leave a little early because Sally's so upset.
We get in a taxi to the cemetery,
but we get out in Greenwich Village.
Two hours of shopping, take another pumpkin to Grand Central.
There's a boutique on MacDougal that has Pocahontas boots.
I am upset, Carol.
Me, too. I heard her dad's a mess.
She was supposed to be a great beauty.
Sarah had this picture of her wearing a bikini on Christmas.
She took it with her.
You know she's gonna miss school till Easter?
I wish my mom was dead.
I'd stay here till 1975 if I could get Betty in the ground.
What are you wearing?
I don't have anything black but my turtleneck,
so I thought I'd wear that with my brown suede skirt and black tights.
Jesus, Draper. ls this your first funeral?
(laughing)
Leave the lights off.
How am I gonna find anything?
Why do you have to do this tonight?
- Hey. - Didn't you already sign Chevy?
Can't you just add the business onto their other contract?
Sweetheart, let me explain this to you.
This is the Southern California Chevrolet Dealers Association.
Chevy's the factory, this is the store.
You're not listening to me.
Just has to be there when he wakes up.
He's so drunk, he doesn't even know where he is.
That's why it has to be there when he wakes up
with a note that says,
"You promised to sign this no matter what."
( moans )
You are such a big deal.
( Door opens )
How'd it go?
- I got 'em. - Good work.
- Good night, Bonnie. - Good night.
- ( Door closes ) - ( both laughing )
( elevator bell dings )
Peggy: Hold that, please.
- Hello, New York. - Howdy.
Oh, Michael, very nice work on Butler.
Stan, we're going to need renderings, color.
( Elevator bell dings )
- How's Monday? - Today is Friday.
Whew, I'm buried all day and I have plans tonight.
So you can finish tonight and have plans all weekend.
- She's gonna find out. - What?
( Sighs )
Maybe if you invite me, you can have till Tuesday.
We now all know you don't have plans for Valentine's Day.
Oh.
She has plans. Look at her calendar.
"February 14, masturbate gloomily."
- ( elevator bell dings ) - Monday is fine.
Who are these from?
Hard to believe your cat has the money.
Really lovely.
Look at you, every inch a girl.
Is this some kind of joke?
Just tell me now because I don't want to have to fire you later.
Enjoy your flowers, boss.
Oh.
Happy Valentine's Day, Shirley.
And happy Valentine's Day to you.
Shirley, I see there's no card,
but I'd like to know who sent me these beautiful flowers.
Well, actually--
Oh.
Oh.
I understand now.
Oh, good.
Could you get me some coffee?
What time is it on the coast?
- Pardon? - 6:00 a.m.
I'll handle it.
Could you get the door?
( Phone rings )
Ted Chaough's office.
Good morning, Moira. It's Peggy.
Where are you?
I'm in my office, but I need you to relay a message to Ted for me.
Oh, okay.
Tell him that I got his message.
No, tell him that I relayed his message
to the client and...
And what?
There's nothing he can do.
They're not--
they don't want to hear any more pitches.
The business is gone.
Really? What account?
He'll know.
Well, the snow's melted, but not the hearts of New Yorkers.
I just had some old lady call me a "kike."
- ls that right? - Yeah.
She was letting her dog relieve himself
and I said, "Pardon me, but you want to curb that thing?"
She says, "Mind your own business, kike."
( laughs ) Maybe it's the hat.
The strangest things happen to you.
Hey, did you see this?
Ogilvy signed Hershey.
I hadn't heard that.
( Man speaking on P.A. )
She hates her because she got a C in Western Civ.
She corrects my English.
I went to school in England.
Are we going to walk into school with these?
We'll say they're Sarah's.
Is my purse in your bag?
The senior class sent her flowers because they're all so concerned.
Half of them think her name is Sally.
Shit, I must have left it at the coffee shop.
Maybe in the head shop?
I'm just going to go up and check at the counter.
- I'll get your fare. - No, my address book is in there.
- It's everybody I know. - We can't wait.
There's another train in a couple hours.
- "Hello, Dawn." - "Hello, Shirley."
You shouldn't be taking a break right where you are.
I'm not. I'm getting her coffee. And I'm taking my time.
- ( Chuckles ) What did she do now? - It ain't funny.
Charles sent me 12 long-stem roses in a crystal vase
and she took 'em.
I was right at the photocopier when she came in
preparing her shit, and somehow--
'cause I put the card in my purse,
I guess because it said, "I love you so"--
she thought they were hers.
Well, it was an honest mistake.
Who the hell is sending her flowers?
(laughs)
Why didn't you say something?
It was too late. I tried.
- You tried? - I really did.
Well, they're hers now.
I'm gonna tell her.
You want those flowers so bad,
you'll take the trouble that comes with getting them back?
It's not right.
Well, I have two bosses
and one of them hasn't told his wife he's on leave.
Keep pretending.
That's your job.
Well, you know who I feel the worst for is Charles.
He'd rather you have a job.
You know that's not true.
"Happy Valentine's, Dawn."
"Good-bye, Shirley."
Dave: You look good. Rested.
You said that. How do I usually look?
It's just that you've been so busy for the last two years,
you've never taken me up for lunch.
I figured you're on some kind of break.
Maybe I'm doing research.
Maybe I want our place to be a little bit more like Wells Rich Greene.
You'd have to have Mary.
And, you know, you probably could.
I knew you were gonna tell me how great it is to work there,
but I didn't think that's where you'd start.
So you looking to make a change?
I have a job.
And I have a contract and a noncompete clause.
And I'm a partner.
Look, I don't know what the truth is and I don't really care.
Someone said you were dabbling in the LA office
or managing your wife's career.
People say things.
Well, then you probably heard the one
where you pulled a major boner in a meeting
and you cried or punched somebody or something
and that they cut you loose.
I didn't know I was gonna be interrogated
by the Hooterville telephone operator.
So it's not true?
You're spoiling the mood.
( Chuckles )
How about for a second date, we go see the Knicks?
Right on the floor.
Bradley's having one hell of a season.
That's a good idea.
Hello?
Can I help you, sweetheart?
Who are you?
I'm Mr. Avery. You looking for casting?
No, I'm looking for my dad, Donald Draper.
Uh, well, he's not here.
Did he change offices?
Perfect.
Look, honey, he's not here.
He's probably at home. You should call him.
You know how to get an outside line?
Is Joan here?
That's a good idea. Her office is right down there.
You know, I think everybody's at lunch.
( slams )
Have a nice day.
So she's sitting there on the conference table
Indian-style in a dress and boots
like some kind of perverted kindergarten teacher
and she says, "Well, thank you, Robert.
I know it's the best you can do."
What did Bob do?
Accepted his death gracefully.
I see a sheep and a wolf.
But which is which?
- How are you, Don? - Great.
Jim Hobart, Dave Wooster.
We know each other.
So, Dave, how come you'll have lunch with Don and not with me?
'Cause this is social. He's not trying to buy us.
Well, what are you trying to do, Don?
Are you taking lunches now?
No, I'm just looking for love.
Well, on behalf of myself
and all the millionaires at McCann Erickson,
we'd love a chance to tell you how handsome you are.
Move along, Jim.
Tell Mary I picked up the check, because I just did.
I don't have to crap on McCann for you, do I?
I almost worked there. Twice.
But you didn't.
Here, I want you to have these.
It smells like an Italian funeral in there.
( Keys clicking )
So then dessert finally arrives and the ladies,
on cue, depart to the toilets.
And as we're standing, Honeywell leans in and says,
"I like what I see."
Now, I thought he was making a ribald comment about my date,
but he followed up by suggesting
we retire to the bar, just the two of us.
Is this a partners' meeting
or the most tedious wireless program I've ever heard?
- ( Chuckles ) - Pete: What?
What did he say?
- We're on the edge of our seats. -( laughing )
- Hello, New York? - He's saying get to it, Pete.
- Did you kiss the man or not? - Fine.
Well, he didn't want to say it in front of the boys from Detroit,
but he wants us to handle his business.
He rules the SoCal dealerships with an iron fist.
- That's great. - Wonderful.
- That's wonderful news. - It is, isn't it?
They want us to start on the summer sale.
Sign them right away.
Sit in his yard with a pen if you have to.
Pete: Contract came with the milkman.
I'll get Bob Benson to fly in from Detroit for the signing.
We don't want the tail wagging the dog.
They're the Dealers Association.
They bill almost as much as Chevy does.
They are the dog.
- He's right. - Just a minute.
Chevy's our client and they're our entree to GM,
which bills more than everything on the planet.
I would tell Detroit we've got this opportunity
and I would ask for their blessing.
Look, when I brought in Chevy,
I got their very own Mikey O'Brien laid.
Sorry, sweetheart. And it wasn't easy. Sorry again.
Pete caught him. Let Pete mount him.
Can we move on?
This phone call is already eating into our fee.
Ted, weren't you there when we signed Chevy?
Roger seems to have failed to get a head count.
I don't see any reason to keep score.
Gentlemen, this is good news.
And I have no problem with flying to Detroit
and briefing Bob and all those--
I'll bring oranges.
- Ted? Are you there? - ( static hissing )
Hello, California?
- Dee, can you hear us? - Yes, I can.
- Dee? - ( sighs )
What's wrong with you? I say up, you say down.
I'm surprised you're disagreeing with me.
It's common sense.
I think they can't hear us.
We can hear you!
Pete can service the account,
but he will report to our man in Detroit
where said parties will be offered
the right of refusal.
I remember very clearly when Don and I signed Chevy.
Don who?
Our collective ex-wife who still receives alimony?
- Hang up. - Pete: No.
Roger: This is a partners' meeting.
Let's poll the partners, shall we?
- Aye. - Aye what?
I agree with Jim.
Moira, fix the phone.
I feel caught off guard by having a confrontation
over something that seems rudimentary.
( Phone clicks )
They never said which of Peggy's accounts we lost.
Call me when you fix the damn phone.
Let me try out there.
What difference could that possibly make?
I thought we were gonna get a new one of these.
And why the hell aren't we in the conference room?
Do not go after him.
Moira, you can reach me in my office.
( TV playing )
Hello?
- ( TV turns off ) - Marta?
Oh, I looked everywhere for you.
What are you doing here?
What happened? ls everything okay?
Obviously not.
- Where were you? - I was at the office.
What?
I wasn't feeling well. I left early.
What happened?
Does your mother know where you are?
What? No.
You're not supposed to be off campus.
My roommate's mother died and they let us go to the funeral,
but I lost my purse.
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.
I just need money for the train.
And I guess I need a note of excuse.
I'll drive you.
No, it's okay. You're not feeling well.
I'll be fine.
You really don't have to.
It looks like you have a lot of work to do.
Come on, it'll be nice. We'll take a drive.
What's the note supposed to say?
What?
Sally, what do I say?
Just tell the truth.
Where the hell were you?
I was getting your perfume.
- Draper's daughter showed up. - Sally was here?
I don't know her name. She was looking for him.
My Lord. What did you say?
I said he's probably at home. It's not my problem.
I have to call him.
Call him?
You have to call him? Okay.
Don't bother apologizing to me, I guess.
- I'm very sorry. - ( slams )
Want to go before we go?
- ( Phone rings ) - I'm fine.
- Hello. - It's Dawn.
And I'm really sorry.
I don't know what happened,
but Sally came into the office and she talked to Lou.
- And what did he say? - I don't know.
But I wanted you to know that she might be on her way.
Okay. Thank you, Dawn.
Do you have to stay?
No.
Let's go.
Hello, Dawn.
Lou said he wanted to see me.
- Oh. - ( button clicks )
Lou, Joan's here to see you.
Lou: Actually, I need to see the both of you.
Get the door.
When I generously agreed
to share Dawn here with Don Draper,
it was for the purposes of his correspondence
and incoming phone calls, not cleaning up his messes.
One of those things is very time-consuming.
- What happened? - His daughter came by.
Why are we going through all this?
I know you can't fire her.
Just move her to another part of the building.
Lou, I will take care of this.
- What do you mean by that? - I want my own girl.
- Come along, Dawn. - In a minute.
Obviously I can say anything I want.
But you don't want to.
I skipped my lunch to buy your wife perfume.
If you had been thoughtful enough to get her a gift
when I told you about it 10 days ago, I would have been here.
Do you understand? It's not my problem.
None of this has anything to do with me.
I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing.
Was that necessary?
When she comes back from the ladies',
have her hand over the keys.
New York is on the line.
Do you have to put them on the contraption?
It's just Mr. Sterling.
- This is Pete. - It's Roger.
I appreciate you fighting for me.
Well, Jim pled his case
and we decided it's best to keep the business,
but run it past Detroit.
- Which means Bob gets involved. - What?
Jim and I had a meaningful conversation--
I heard your conversation. You're full of it.
That is just the kind of weakness
that got us in this position to begin with.
Let me just go to Detroit. I'm sure--
...something to do with Bob or my feelings towards Bob,
but it really doesn't.
It's a chance for me to rectify my status with those people.
And in the end, that's our best route to new business.
Dee: He disconnected.
- ( Sighs ) - ( bangs )
Why even bring in an account?
They're just gonna take it away.
Sometimes I think maybe I died
and I'm in some kind of...
I don't know if it's heaven or hell or limbo.
But I don't seem to exist.
No one feels my existence.
Just cash the checks. You're gonna die one day.
What you're supposed to say is,
"Hey, why don't we just start our own agency?"
At least the goal would be clear.
I mean, what am I working for here?
There's two offices.
Yours is only slightly better than mine.
What am I supposed to do, work my way up to your office?
You can have my office.
No, that is not the point.
Cutler sent you out here because you're too moral.
He couldn't look you in the face and be Machiavelli.
That's not why I'm here.
Why are you here?
All you do is answer the phone and mope around.
You know what?
We're not talking anymore.
From now on, we'll both pretend I'm in New York.
( Door slams )
Joan wants us to switch desks.
Don't feel bad. It's not your fault.
I know.
Don't be sore, but I'm really happy.


I need a box.
She wants you out front right now.
Okay. Well, just a few things.
He takes it light with two Sweet'N Lows.
Always put through his son Earl.
These three lines are Lou's
and this one is Mr. Draper's.
Maybe I should get a pencil.
You know what?
I'll have Mr. Draper's calls come straight to me at reception.

She has Mr. Chaough on the line.
You've got to be kidding me. Tell him I'm busy.
Do you want me to take a message?
No, I want you to leave a message.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Tell her to tell Ted
that I have no intention of talking to him today.
And that's it. That's all I said.
Okay.
That's what she said.
You know what, Shirley?
I've been thinking about it and I know it's silly,
but could you please throw these flowers away?
Why?
I'm sorry, but they're cursed.
No, they're not. They're beautiful.
Look, I should have bought you flowers
out of respect,
not because of some holiday.
Are these some symbol of how much we're loved?
- It's a joke. - Please, don't.
I'll get you some new ones.
Please, those are my flowers.
They're from my fiancé.

I had to shuffle the girls.
Well, I'm all for the national advancement of colored people,
but I do not believe they should advance

Do you want me to dismiss her based on the color of her skin?
I said nothing of the kind.
I'm merely suggesting a rearrangement

Pete: Hello?
- Bonnie? - Pete?
Hello, Valentine.
What a pleasant surprise.
Did you come to see me work?
Because I wasn't expecting you till 5:00.
There's been a change of plans.
You're going to be showing me around your body
at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
The devil and his temptations.
I will be there at 5:15 unless I get an offer.
You have an offer.
I love my flowers.
And I love you.
But I also love the 15 strangers who might buy this dump.
( Scoffs )
Well, excuse me if I don't see the point right now.
I mean, I landed that whale and New York just took it away.
And I realized if the system's rigged against me,
I might as well enjoy myself.
I once sold a house for $108,000.
Two weeks later, during escrow, it b*rned down.
I had driven this Okie couple around for a year.
Bought lunches,
looked at pictures of their hideous children.
Do you know where Altadena is?
Might as well be Barstow.
I'd show up and have to change my blouse
because the sweat stains were meeting between my breasts.
I could have lived for months on that commission.
And then it was all gone
because some assh*le barreling down Lake Avenue
threw his cigarette out the window.
I'm sorry, but it's not the same.
It's worse. I'm in sales, too.
Not some housewife complaining about getting oatmeal out of a carpet.

and he wants to take us to the smoker.
- Yolanda said-- - You know what, Carol?
- I should go. - Well, we hid your booty.
Your sandals, they're in the back of the closet next to your cleats.
So at least the trip was worth it.
I'll see you later. Bye.
What's this?
I sot you a patty melt.
Everything okay?
Mm-hmm.
I don't like you going to funerals.
It was awful.
Sarah's mom was yellow.
She was wearing this wig.
I hate that you had to see that.
I only went so I could go shopping.
I doubt that.
I don't know.
Life goes on.
I'm so many people.
Can you see the car from here?
Yes.
Good.
I want you to finish your meal.
I'm gonna go out to the car and get it running.
Then you walk out.
We're not gonna pay.
Really?
Don't bother with the flowers. Everyone's gone.
No, these are mine.
They're from my son. Thank you, Roger.
Well, I bet he's gonna be pretty upset if he sees you giving them away.
I'm not.
I'm taking them to my new office.
Up here?
It was suggested that I move now that I have some accounts.
Jim suggested it?
Do you disagree?
Does it matter?
Well, Rome wasn't built in a day.
( Phone ringing )
Ah, hello.
Hello.
Apparently we're going to finish that conference call on Monday.
That won't be necessary.
I set Pete straight.
Hmm, glad to hear it.
I'd hate to think of you as an adversary.
I'd really hate that.
You sure I don't have to go in and talk to anyone?
No, I have the note.
Happy Valentine's Day. I love you.
