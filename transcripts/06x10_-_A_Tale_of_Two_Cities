This convention instructs the Democratic National Committee...
that it shall include in the call for the 1972 convention...
the following addition to section one-
quote, it is the further understanding...
Should I pack your swim trunks?
What?
Theyre supposed to be debating the w*r.
They can debate it all they want, they just cant come out against it.
Then no one will vote for Humphrey.
Over Nixon?
Well, they cant have the whole convention without talking about the w*r.
Thirty seconds after prime time, theyll start the debate.
Cops have been hassling protesters all day.
Also not in prime time.
- Youre so cynical. - Come over here.
Come with me. Well go back to Disneyland.
From what I remember, something amazing happened there.
- I made the biggest mistake of my life. - Thats true.
You know Id come if I could.
Youll have fun. Just stay away from actresses.
Do they have them out there?
I hate actresses.
Kenny said that this time he went to a floor...
in the Chevy building hed never been to before.
He said it was like Get Smart.
Just a bunch of doors in procession.
And he met the man he believes to be the source of our current torture.
- Whats his name? - Same as the rest of them- Jack something.
Apparently his feelings were hurt because we havent kissed his ring.
Well, Id be happy to go there and help soften him up.
If anyones going, Im going.
But you cant because youre going to Los Angeles for- What again?
Im going to pay them a visit immediately.
Dont want to miss our flight. Are we going?
- Right after the partners meeting. - Oh.
Are we done here?
Sweetheart, could you step out?
This morning I received an envelope addressed to Sterling Gleason and Pryce.
- From who? - It doesnt matter.
They dont know our name because we dont know our name.
Arent we SCDPCGC?
Not officially.
Well, Im tired of the conversation that goes along with my business card.
I know that no one has observed the memo that requested specifically...
that all seven letters be used when answering the phone.
Sterling, Cooper, Draper, Pryce, Cutler, Gleason and Chaough? Its a mouthful.
SCDPCGC is a mouthful.
But CGCSCDP is not.
- I dont agree. - Weve each lost a partner.
Why dont we each lose a letter?
SCDC.
- What do the Cs stand for? - Not Campbell.
- Cooper and Cutler. - Pardon me?
Well, SCDCC. sounds like a stutter and looks like a typo.
Very well, if it puts this to rest, I will gladly withdraw my name...
along with the other deceased parties in this conversation.
Bert, dont be a martyr.
Want to throw away both of these brands?
Just leave it alone. Well get a bigger front door.
Well, of course you like it. Youre at the front.
- Im at the end. - Im at the end.
Well, I move to table this. You have fun in Detroit.
- And you have fun with Manischewitz. - Any special instructions?
Yeah, the guy in charge, just pick an eye and stick with it.
Very well, but its my belief that any further delay...
in choosing our name will take it out of our hands...
and leave it up to the world.
You know Sunkist is still only doing print work?
Im cutting you off.
- Youre two ahead of me. - No, from work.
Come on. Were executives.
Leave the drudgery to Ted Chaough and the rest of the underlings.
- Did you prepare at all? - Sunkist, Carnation, the avocado people.
My biggest job in these meetings...
is to keep them from saying "golly" too many times.
Carnation has 27 million in billings.
I dont think the guy in charge ties his pants with a rope.
I didnt say that. But I guarantee they all have a certain regard...
for two gentlemen from the big city.
- You mean they wont trust us? - I mean they dont trust themselves.
I dont know if you realize it, but we are big New York admen...
from an agency with seven letters in its name.
That means under no circumstances...
are you to trot out that drawl you do when youve had too many.
Be slick. Be glib. Be you.
Well, Im usually informed.
Were conquistadors.
Im Vasco da Gama, and youre... some other Mexican.
Were gonna land there, buy whatever theyve got for the beads in our pockets.
Our biggest challenge is to not get syphilis. Cathy.
Another round. And send one to the pilot.
... hours of a crimonious debate...
the Democratic National Convention has rejected a plank...
advanced by Democratic doves...
calling for an unconditional end to all b*mb of North Vietnam.
- The discussion was conducted- - Whats going on?
They delayed till noon, and then they rejected it.
- Rejected what? - The peace plank.
A chance to have a platform against the w*r.
Uh-huh. Then let me clarify my question.
Whats going on with the work for Manischewitz?
Because youre for the w*r.
You know theres 200 body bags every week.
Figure out how to get into that business yet?
I refuse to be distracted by events in which I have no actual stake or participation.
- How could you say that? - Because he doesnt have any sons.
I served in the Air Force. Did you?
Youre disgusting, you know that?
This whole thing works because people like you look the other way.
- Ginsberg. - My politics are private.
But that presentation isnt.
Now, are you gonna hide your dawdling behind your outrage?
Youll have your work, and you know it.
You can go in there and take credit for it like you always do.
Be friendly and charming after youve stuck your fascist boot on my neck!
So Im a fascist because I gave you a deadline?
No, youre a fascist because you love business, and you hate everything else-
freedom, blacks, Jews.
- This is my stop. - I hate hypocrites.
Like hippies who cash checks from Dow Chemical and General Motors.
You rooting for the Soviets in Prague, too, you n*zi?
Michael, what are you doing? That man is your boss.
Why are you always down here? Go back upstairs!
Youre a truncheon, Cutler!
Thanks for making that worse.
Hello, Ted.
You busy?
Extremely.
I think you know Im a man without regrets...
but I do believe we fired the wrong people...
and Id like to remedy that immediately.
Jim, I think youre upset.
No, because I have a solution.
I think we should remove the rest of their people...
while Sterling, Draper and Crane are in California.
Just lock the gates and leave Pete Campbell as the doorman.
- What happened? - Do I need cause?
How about failure to complete tasks coupled with gross insubordination?
Maybe part of it is you keep seeing this agency...
as our people and their people.
Well, how about your people and my people?
Do I have permission to clean out creative, starting with Mr. Ginsberg?
Jim, hes lightning in a bottle!
You have to start holding hands, starting with his.
Because Ill be in Detroit tomorrow, and youre taking him to Manischewitz.
Sterlings client and Drapers boy.
Im the worlds most expensive babysitter.
Thats the spirit.
I suppose I wouldnt be a good friend if I didnt ask-
is Kate pulling her weight around there?
She arranged this.
She did.
Well, Kate told me that youre the kind of woman...
who wont just tell me what I want to hear.
I hope she didnt make any promises.
My wife always says Im the kind of man who doesnt like to ask for directions.
My new job has me face-to-face with ad agencies.
I dont know what Im doing.
Kate said you were divorced.
I am. I forgot.
What does that say?
Anyway, what should I look for in an agency?
Oh, well, a good agency should tell you.
Go ahead.
Me?
Thats why Im here.
Yes.
Of course.
Well, I suppose we dont just lean on stylish creative and market research.
We listen to the client.
Doesnt everybody do that?
Despite your modesty, you already know...
that the way to get invited into peoples homes is through their TV sets.
Media placement is part science, part courage.
Anyone can tell you not to run makeup ads during football.
The trick is finding your customers in places you hadnt thought to look.
Harry Crane is a wizard.
They use a computer the size of this restaurant.
And what is your job there?
Im in charge of thinking of things before people know they need them.
- Ive got this. - Come on.
Please, this is what I get paid to do.
I was just coming to see you.
- But youre not going anywhere. - I was, but then you appeared.
At the risk of playing defense...
I only interfered because I hate disrespect.
I dont know what youre talking about.
- Neither do I. - Hmm.
I believe in you, Bob. But youre untested.
Manischewitz, tomorrow afternoon- think you can handle the parties involved?
Michael Ginsberg or the clients?
I dont see much difference, do you?
I think I can keep the volume down.
Excellent.
I welcome this chance to shine.
Hmm.
- Are you on a deadline? - No, do you need me?
- I need a drink. - Okay.
I had this lunch my friend Kate set up, and I think its a potential client.
- I know he is. - Who is he?
The new head of marketing at Avon.
I thought it was a date, but it turned out to be better.
- I love Avon. - Of course.
And youd be perfect for it.
Its just- I dont know what to do with it. Hes leaving town tomorrow.
So set a meeting.
I know I have to, but Dons not here...
and I dont want to get kicked off the diving board.
Well take it to Ted. Hell know what to do.
- What did I just say? - Hes not like that.
- And what do I ask for? - I dont know.
Youll be the account man if thats what you want.
Trust me, he loves new business.
He doesnt care where it comes from. Lets go.
- I told you I wanted a rental car. - They insisted.
- Ted, do you have a minute? - Just barely.
Well, its kind of urgent. Joan has a solid lead.
Hes leaving tomorrow. We need to set a meeting.
Good for you. Get Pete Campbell down here.
- Who is it? - Its Avon Cosmetics.
Very groovy.
The new head of marketing, hes a friend of a very close friend of mine...
and I just wanted to introduce him to Peggy.
- Peggyd be perfect for it. - You rang?
- Pete, as head of new business- - Since when? I dont want that.
Joan has a lead for Avon Cosmetics.
Peggys creative. Hes leaving town tomorrow. Reel him in.
Fly safe.
Avon Cosmetics.
Thats Fortune 500. Whats his name?
Andy Hayes.
My friend Kate just moved there from Mary Kay, and she sent him my way.
Tell me everything you can about him and set lunch tomorrow for Peggy and me.
I should be there.
Joan, this is how things get botched.
First, account man and creative.
Then if all goes well, next trip...
he visits the office, and you show him around.
I think hell be expecting me.
Shouldnt Joan make the introductions?
I dont understand what the problem is.
Youre going to make the call...
and tell him how important I am, and how exciting Peggy is.
And then were going to tell him how essential you are.
Dont worry. Youll get all the credit.
Clara. Are you coming?
Geez. Hey, I let you sit up front.
Sorry about that. You need a hand?
What?
Theres no one from G.M. in Los Angeles?
- Get rid of that car. - And get us something with a roof.
Dont want to show up to a meeting with bugs in my teeth.
So, you want to take a dip in the pool or should I just wait in the bar?
- Both have attractive scenery. - Wheres the bellman?
Mañana, Don. Everythings mañana here.
Need to take a shower. You can wait in the bar if you want.
- Im gonna get room service. - Were gonna go to the Sunset Strip...
- Watch a girl dance in a cage. - That you heard?
Save your strength for tomorrow.
Going to a party in the hills.
- Its very hip. - Beverly Hills?
No, the hills. And its movies, not TV.
My friend in development at CBS says its going to be crawling with moguls.
- Geez, its hot here. - Its a dry heat.
Its a dry heave.
Come on, Don. Lets go to the Strip right now and get some dinner.
No, Im gonna turn in.
Tried to sleep on the plane, but somebody wouldnt stop talking.
Dont worry, I got this.
This is on tape since again were not able to cover it live.
The tape youre about to see was made about 30 to 40 minutes ago.
It was supposed to be a nonviolent demonstration today.
And one will never know what it was that made it become violent.
This is directly in front of what advertises itself...
as the worlds largest and friendliest hotel.
Where at this hour people stand around...
and sit in their rooms with handkerchiefs...
- Hello. - Are you watching this?
Yeah.
Its hard to believe no one got k*ll.
Is that the only measure?
Can you imagine a policeman cracking your skull?
It would change your whole life.
Honey, theyre throwing rocks.
Theyre prepared for trouble.
In some places, plain clothes men are helping make the arrests.
On the bright side, Conrad Hilton is probably in that hotel right now.
Dont make jokes.
Megan, you cant even vote.
But I live here.
Im sorry.
I want you to be careful.
This could easily start a riot.
Dont worry. Im not going anywhere.
Really?
You can if you want to.
I miss you.
Go for a swim.
It always makes you feel better.
The whole world is watching.
The whole world is watching. The whole world is watching.
Theres a break in the arrests now-
We should hang up. This is costing a fortune.
Try and get some sleep.
You too.
- Theyre now moving down Balboa Street. - Bye.
Bye.
So you came after all.
Pete couldnt make it.
What? How the hell are we supposed to do this?
Dont worry about it. Coffee, please.
I didnt know Ted was going to handle it that way.
Well, he did.
And Petes not coming...
because he wasnt invited.
- You cant do that. - I did it.
If you want to leave, go ahead.
I hope I didnt keep you waiting, but I was trying to check out.
See, if you were a client, you could have left your key at the desk...
and we would have attended to that.
Andy Hayes, Peggy Olson.
Shes the dynamite in our creative department.
I dont know about that.
Tomato juice and coffee, please.
I didnt want you to leave New York without meeting Peggy.
Her expertise has been honed by her work on Clearasil...
Ponds Cold Cream, and most relevant, Belle Jolie lipsticks.
I almost worked there.
- Do you remember "Mark your man"? - I do.
I grew up in an Avon home.
Our lady was Gladys Bowman.
She was very elegant.
My mother would vacuum the drapes before she came.
Then my sister and I would fight over the catalog.
- In fact- - In fact, all women...
have some kind of personal connection to Avon.
But that doesnt turn into advertising, now, does it?
Why dont you tell us your biggest challenge?
Were here to listen. Its just hard to hide our enthusiasm.
Its true.
Well, they dont bring in a new guy unless theyre expanding or sales are flat.
Im afraid its the latter.
Women are working. Theyre not home.
And hippies dont wear makeup at all.
Im not sure if we should try to be "groovier" or nostalgic.
Were somewhere in between right now.
Thats about it.
Peggy?
Yes, Joan?
What do you think of your current work?
Besides the fact that its not working?
Its okay. We didnt do it.
I dont know how to describe it.
Would you say its unintentionally old-fashioned?
Yes. Yes, I would.
Im sure youve thought of this already...
but Joan and I were saying how convenient it would be...
to have the Avon lady come to the office maybe during lunch.
Well, theyre not resistant to trying that, just to advertising it.
Theres no doorbell in an office.
I only saw a little bit of it on the morning news...
but Im sorry I missed Humphreys acceptance speech.
I assume he was high-voiced and desperate.
Youre the exception. Early numbers look like over 80 million people.
Look, we all hated what we saw, but the Democrats are dead.
Its over. Not just now, maybe forever.
As you were. Nobody get up.
Nonsense, Jack. Great to see you finally.
Roger Sterling, Don Draper.
George was just laughing that these riots gave Nixon the election.
I dont think thats anything to smile about.
And although this boardroom has been the site...
of many casual political conversations among better men than us...
this is a business meeting.
Youre right, Jack.
Last night was disgusting...
seeing those long-haired fools shame this country.
You think Richard Nixon is going to fix that?
I think hes a patriot.
Dutch Reagan is a patriot. Nixon is an opportunist.
Now why dont you gentlemen tell us how its possible...
to devote your energies to our nutritious...
and delicious Instant Breakfast and Life Cereal at the same time?
Well, Jack, your powdered milk and dairy products...
have had a long, successful relationship with breakfast cereal.
Theres no reason to give that up.
And as far as we can tell, Instant Breakfast has a different target- adults.
They dont eat cereal.
They eat bacon and eggs.
And this is healthier, easier and instant.
And what if we were to say we find the conflict unresolvable?
Im sorry to interrupt, but we discussed this over the phone.
This is about a whole different level of exposure for your products.
All of them. You should be in game shows.
You should have a presence on Saturday morning.
Where well sit right next to one of your cereal ads?
- Don? - Look, Jack, George...
Im sure you know that we would do anything to make this work.
We believe that strongly in Carnation.
We believe in the wholesomeness of both your intentions and your products.
To be frank, weve worked with New York firms before.
We come in in the morning, try to get you, everyones at lunch.
And when people are at lunch around here...
thats just the time we get a message from you.
And with it comes an attitude...
as if to say were not working hard out here.
I can assure you, it is very much to the contrary.
Look, were sorry your last girlfriend hurt you.
Were in your office right now.
Tell us what you have in mind.
What is going on? I just handed you the business of your life.
What is going on? You just threw it away.
Morning, ladies.
Morning.
Stop that.
What exactly are you planning to do?
Are you trying to intimidate me?
No, thats always been impossible...
because that would require respect for me or what I do.
I know you want this, and now you cant have it.
You couldve, but now you cant.
Its mine. And Ive been doing account work...
in one form or another since the day I started.
But youre not in that department.
I never said that to you...
when you stopped filing and started writing copy.
Yes, you did. Every day.
And it was worse because you made me feel like I couldnt do it.
I know you can do this.
So why do you think I should give it away?
I worked my way up.
You were so brave, letting Don carry you to the deep end of the pool.
I never slept with him.
Congratulations. You really are just like them.
Im sorry, but I never thought I would be in the position to say...
"Joan, youve made a mistake."
I have to do it myself, Peggy.
This is the only way I could do it.
Because all that matters now is who has a relationship with that client.
Who is the client going to call?
Well, I am sick to my stomach...
thinking about what youre going to say when they find out.
Ill be fine.
Gentlemen, after all...
this business of selling narrows down to one thing.
Just one thing. Seeing the people.
Show me any man of ordinary ability...
who will go out and earnestly tell-
Benson here.
- Ginzo, you have a visitor. - Where is he?
Michael?
- Whats wrong? - I feel sick.
I got diarrhea. My mouth is dry.
I didnt sleep last night. I dont want to go. Im not going.
Oh, sure. Youll talk to him?
I love you. You know that. Youre a mother hen.
- Michael, you look fine. - Stop calling me Michael.
We have to go. Its a very important meeting.
And I dont say that to scare you, I say that to inspire you.
Im not scared. Im a thug.
Im a pig. Im part of the problem.
"Now I am become Death. Destroyer of worlds."
Come on, buddy. Youre not Death.
You got a little stage fright.
Maybe you smoked too many funny cigarettes.
I never touch that stuff. It makes you crazy.
I know what youre feeling, and its fear.
But not fear of failure, fear of opportunity.
I cant watch this.
Look, you cant put yourself in the right place at the right time.
You got to be in the right place all the time.
Listen, man, I cant turn off the transmissions to do harm.
Theyre beaming them right into my head.
Damn it, there is no harm in this!
Manischewitz are good people. Theyre your people.
And they sell wine for religious ceremonies of all faiths.
Now pull yourself together and be the man that I admire.
Tell me the truth. Are you a h*m*?
Theres that sense of humor.
I would like to have her for lunch.
Well, dont have Harry Crane set it up.
He got us very high up with three major companies.
You forgot because Chevy fell in your lap...
but big accounts require a golf and dining offensive.
- When are we gonna do that? - Next time.
Harry, what did I say about that car?
Well, Cindy, these are my friends Don and Roger.
Pleasure.
Theres tacos and booze outside.
If you want a joint, try the candy dish on the coffee table.
Or make a friend.
- You look familiar. - Youll have to do better than that.
As you can tell, theres a different protocol.
I look forward to figuring it out.
Just let me make introductions. They dont dig business cards.
Who is that? I know him.
Earl Rice from Kodak. Hes their studio rep.
I dont think he was there when you were. I know he never goes east.
No, not him. Isnt that Danny?
Jesus, he is everywhere.


Its Daniel J. Siegel now.
Danny Siegel?
Producer. And thats Irwin Fields. Hes at Paramount.
Whats he doing here?
Probably trying to buy one of Dannys movies.
Not him.
Roger, Don. Whereve you been all my life?
Come on. This will be fun.
Daniel, my man. Did we interrupt?
Itll keep, man.
Danny. What are you up to these days?
Taking care of business. That was Irwin Fields.
And this is just Lotus. Shes from Sacramento.
- So how do you know Stephen? - Oh, Ive known Stephen a long time.
Whereas Danny weve only known for a very short time.
I know these lugs back from my days in advertising.
More like a day, wasnt it?
Hey, it wasnt my bag. I had to quit.
You didnt quit. You were fired.
Harry, why dont you introduce me to the bar?
Hmm.
Actually, Danny and I used to be related.
Daniel.
His ex-wife is still my cousin.
Youd like her. Shes about your age.
There are small differences.
- Tiny things youd notice. - Hmm.
Stephen.
I was just telling Lotus here how Im finally...
making a picture with a major studio.
Were gonna do Alice in Wonderland.
And Stephen over there works for Ben Kalmenson, president of Warner Brothers...
whos also here somewhere.
He took over from Jack Warner.
You know what, Lotus?
Im gonna introduce you.
Nice rapping with you, Rog.
So most of the pictures dont have a lot of score right now.
They like pop songs. You know, kids want to hear a hit.
I think ads are going that way too.
What kind of ads you do?
Well, we represent Chevrolet, Mohawk Airlines.
- Where are they? - The northeast.
Samsonite luggage. Life Cereal.
Well, if times get tough, Im gonna look you up, Donny.
I dig jingles, and I hear the breads out of sight.
Don, there you are. Ben Kalmensons leaving.
I think hes headed to a party in the canyon.
Should we follow him?
- You know Ben? - Do you?
I was looking for the restroom.
Well, theres an extra nipple here when you come back.
It can wait.
Take off your shoes.
Do you like hashish?
I dont know yet.
Hey, man, are you the guy who came in a taxi?
You dont talk much, do you?
In fact, Im wondering if youre hearing a word I say.
Are you tripping?
Ive done it five times.
So if youre trying to see through me...
just know that I am this handsome and this rich.
Dont worry about your hang-ups.
Lotus, lets split.
Together?
- Shes gonna crash in my guesthouse. - Until her audition?
Its up to her, man.
Im sure it is. Lotus, honey, theres no reason to start at the bottom.
Yeah, maybe he can help your dream come true...
of having your lips on the side of a bus.
What are you gonna do when you fail here? Keep going west?
Japans a long walk for those little legs.
Lotus, lets go.
Youre lucky I hate violence, man.
Really? I love it. You know, I was a boxer.
Theres nothing like finding that magic spot...
thatll drop a man to his knees.
You know, unless hes already starting there.
Hated to do that.
Mmm.
Im really thirsty.
Theres a pool full of water out there, Don.
I told you, thats not my name.
There you are.
Honey, I-
Youre here.
Is that your old lady?
Its cool. Its California.
Everybody shares.
What are you doing here?
I thought Id surprise you.
How did you find me?
But I live here.
I quit my job.
I couldnt bear to be apart.
And I want to have enough love for my other surprise.
Really?
What do you think it is?
A second chance.
Come with me.
Everybodys looking for you.
I heard you were here.
Are you in the movie business too?
Im not pitching for the Dodgers.
What happened?
Im not at liberty to discuss that.
My wife thinks Im M.I.A., but Im actually dead.
How come you didnt get your arm back?
Dying doesnt make you whole.
You should see what you look like.
Man overboard!
Hes fine. Everybody back away.
Is it real?
They took me to breakfast on the way to the airport and told me Jack signed off.
And hes high enough at Chevy he doesnt have to run it by the whole outfit and-
Bob Benson to see you both.
They finally let me see the car. They had clay models. Its not a dog.
I dont mean to interrupt.
- But thats what youre doing. - Come on in, Bob.
I just got off the phone with Manischewitz.
Apparently theyre putting us in review.
- What happened? - They barely listened to the presentation.
It was a courtesy. They havent liked the work for months.
Shit! Werent you there?
Well, I thought it was high time we embraced Bob.
He was going to go. I talked him out of it.
Roger Sterling let you watch his dog, and it ran away.
Bob, we appreciate you handling this like a man.
And as a reward, Ted and I want you to familiarize yourself with Chevy.
We just found out were moving to the next step.
Were going to need more than Ken in Detroit.
Thats music to my ears.
Welcome aboard.
They shouldnt have gone to California.
Were going to bring in Avon. They gave us Chevy.
Throw in losing Sterlings account, I think we have a lot of good news.
Theyre not gonna think that.
Youre splitting this place and not in half.
Well give them something to take their mind off it.
What do we have?
You caught a cold in California.
I dont know what happened.
I usually feel better out there.
Youve got to stop talking in the past. You know what I learned?
New York is the center of the universe.
We could send a landing craft out there, but they dont understand what we do.
Or they understand it thoroughly.
My shrink says the job of your life is to know yourself.
Sooner or later, youll start to love who you are.
And apparently Im a curious child...
with a full head of hair and a thriving business.
And youre a terrible swimmer.
Come in.
Mr. Campbell wants to see you in the conference room.
Oh. And what is it regarding?
Avon sent over a box of samples to the girls...
and Diane opened it, not me.
Ill be right in.
Everyone out!
Shell be right in.
This shouldnt be in here.
What the hell is this?
I guess Avons serious.
Oh, theyre serious.
When the hell did you have a "productive breakfast"?
- You and Peggy ditched me. - Peggy didnt know.
There was some confusion, and then it was too late.
- And I thought since I mixed things up- - There was no confusion!
- Oh, Im sorry. - I bet you are.
Were you coming in here to celebrate what a fool I am?
You upset the girls. They have nothing to do with this.
So, you opening up your own agency?
Ted assigned her.
Isnt the point that Avons happy?
Oh, I bet youre making him very happy.
Because its better than being screwed by you.
Well see what Ted has to say about this.
Let me handle Ted.
Its too late for that.
Ask her.
Did you meet with Avon and not invite Pete?
It was very last-minute.
Peggy, this doesnt concern you.
Its unacceptable, and Id like to know what you have to say for yourself.
- Does this color look good on me? - Shh!
What would you like for me to say?
Joan, you of all people cant plead ignorance.
Shes going to say something about her client and her connection.
And, honestly, I take no issue with that.
But what we have here is a breach of the fundamental rules of this business.
An account executive signs business...
and they send their junior to maintain it.
To maintain their bosss relationship.
The entire thing falls apart if I send you to the store to get cake...
and you eat it on the way home.
Did you really try to squeeze him out?
You have nothing to say for yourself, then?
Its a revolt!
- Excuse me. - Meredith, not now.
"Joan, Andrew Hayes from Avon is on the phone for you."
Oh, it just gets better.
What are you waiting for? Go take it.
- Thats it? - Possession is nine-tenths of the law.
Only where there is no law.
Pete, were all working together.
All agency business is your business.
Thank you.
You better hope he really calls.
Welcome back. How was your trip?
If you dont mind, this is urgent.
Arent you glad you didnt go straight home?
I have to tell you that in your absence, things have become quite dire.
Mr. Draper, the partners are here.
Come in.
Welcome back. How was California?
It was a series of busts and not the kind I like.
Well, we have a bit of news concerning the firm.
- We should get Joan. - No.
- Anyone else? - No, thank you.
My visit to Detroit was a success.
They finally signed off on the strategy. Even showed me a model of the car.
Thats a relief. Good work.
Also, Joans at the five-yard line with Avon Cosmetics.
Joan?
Well, well, well. While the cats away-
Unfortunately, Manischewitz has put us in review.
Ah, its been coming for months.
But thats not what were here to talk about.
We thought long and hard about what its gonna take to make this agency stable.
Id like to offer what we believe to be a deferential solution.
They want to call the agency Sterling, Cooper & Partners.
Well, we know you like it.
It would depend on Don, Jim, and me all sharing the blow.
Youre willing to do that?
Its the only thing thats equally offensive to all.
S.C. ampersand P.
I can swallow it if you can.
I dont think I should weigh in on this.
Good. Then its settled.
Ill get the art department on a logo.
- Nice work. - I had nothing to do with this.
Have a good weekend.
You have no problems with this?
Pete, were in the same boat, and Im fine with it.
Trust me, that name is a consolation prize.
Its a gravestone to our resistance.
You have no idea whats going on out there.
This is not the same business anymore!
If you dont like it, maybe its time to get out of the business.
Dawn, could you get my wife on the phone?
What are you doing?
Working.
Give me that.
Hey.
