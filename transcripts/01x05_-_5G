This will look good in your office.
What, take that thing on the train,like some kid who won at the 4-H?
Besides, no one wants to looklike they care about awards.
But you do.
Isnt that sad?
Roger was very eloquent.
He likes to be recognized for selling.
Creative is less important.
Creative helps sell.
But he gave the speech.
Look at you in this tuxedo.
Say it for me.
Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Draper.
Enchanted.
Hey.
Its 8:00.
Shit.
Oh, my Lord.
Mommy, Mommy!Ethels downstairs.
Shes making us breakfast.
Sally, Mommy has a headache.
Whats that thing?
Daddys boss won an award.
Daddy won one, too.
An award for good horses?
Go downstairs and eat something.
I think theres Alka-Seltzer in the kitchen.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just do it in the kitchen.
I dont want to hear the bubbles.
Congratulations, Mr. Draper.
Thank you.
I hear Advertising Age ran a picture.
Fortunately, no one reads that.
Thats really amazing.
Ill get Mr. Campbell and Mr. Kinsey.
They wanted you to knowthey were waiting, but they left.
Thats rude.
They said something aboutthe Newkie Award going to your head.
Congratulations, by the way.
Thank you.
Congratulations to you, too.
Thank you, Peggy.
Congratulations for what, being the only oneon time for this meeting?
Oh, I was just telling PeggyI got a short story published.
Good for you.
The Atlantic Monthly.
Look at that.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
What does that have to do with you, Kenny?
"Tapping a Mapleon a Cold Vermont Morning. "
Cosgrove here got a story publishedin The, uh... The Atlantic Monthly.
- Heavy.- Youre kidding.
I look forward to reading it.
Keep it. Ive got copies.
Congrats, indeed. A thing like that.
Youre a writer. You write.
Well, yes.
The weird thing isshort fiction is not my strong suit.
I have two novels.
Novels? About what?
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig
who has to move to Manhattanbecause his wifes mother is sick.
The other one is, well,
a woman whos a widow...
she kind of got stuckwith this family farm.
No one will help her except this boy.
Those dont even sound stupid.
Thanks.
I mean, they both sound good.
- Want to read one?- I do.
But I also want to talkabout Liberty Capital Savings.
Right.
Talk, one of you.
As you know, Jack Konig saysthey want a new promotion.
Interest rates are level.
Some kind of irresistible fireworksthat bring people to the bank,
even if its just to visit.
I hate it when they say fireworks.
Especially when they keeptalking about a toaster
with a warming tray on top, or a blender.
A blenders nice.
Jack keeps talkingabout escalating the toaster wars
in order to lure women in,
which is silly when you think about it,
because other than a few working girls,
most women arentin charge of the banking.
Not in my house.
They visit the bank.
They do.
All we do is try to get the girls in.
Families.
But you know what?
Men need their own accounts,beyond the family.
Men?
Oh, I can see that.
Discretion. Discretionary.
Statements sent to the office.
Yes.
Liberty Capital Private Account.
No.
Executive Account.
Thats why he won an award.
Accounts won the award.
Yeah.
Theres a call for youfrom Bix Beiderbecke.
Hello, Mr. Beiderbecke?
Its me, and dont ask who,or youll spoil the mood.
Whos Bix?
The trumpeter.
I was thinkingabout playing the horn this afternoon.
Where are you calling me from?
I just had a phone put in.
Really. Instant connection,
just like that nightat the ticket booth in Grand Central.
Midge, Im at work.
Just get down here.
I want you to pull my hairand ravish me
and leave me for dead.
Ill be back after lunch.
Kenneth Cosgrove.
I think Im going to vomit.
Who the hell is Ken Cosgrove?
Hes from Burlington, Vermont.
His father is a salesman.
What does that have to do with it?
I cant believe he got published
and didnt tell anyone until it came out.
No, he kept walking aroundlike the idiot he is.
I have this storyabout this crazy night I had
where I ended up in Jersey Citywith all these Negroes,
and we all got along.
Can you imagine how good that story is?
No.
It is.
Its a national magazine.
Yep.
That hurts, too.
That was it.
Thats what I called for.
You can go.
You cant call me at work.
You scared of megetting lonely all the time?
Start having conversations with you
and ring you all the time,
saying, "When are you gonna come over?"
This is working right now.
And it worked today.
Look, Im sorry your lifeis in a million pieces.
Be easier for you to have one less.
I hurt your feelings.
You didnt like my call a little bit?
Im here.
And you waited until you were done
to make me feel badabout the phone call.
I like that you come in here,acting like somebody else.
It must be so intense above 14th Street.
Then you sh**t down on the train.
That look when I open that door.
Sometimes youre preoccupied,
but then you always...
well, you always...
change gears.
I dont even think about it.
I know.
I like being your medicine.
Okay.
Whats wrong with it?
Just tell me. I can tell you dont like it.
Oh, I do.
And I love that youresitting alone at your typewriter,
drinking a Scotch, thinking it up.
But you dont like it.
I mostly read the classics.
It seemed strange to me.Its too modern.
Really?
Uh, thats kind of a compliment.
But I dont think you mean it that way.
I just think its odd that the bear is talking.
The bear is not talking.
Its what the hunter imaginesthe bear to be thinking.
Well, its well-written.
Why dont you submit it?
I was going to when Ifinished dickering with it.
You could run it by Charlie Fiddich.
He has one of those bigpublishing jobs, doesnt he?
Your friend Laura kept sayinghow he makes things happen there.
Why would I do that?
Because he can help us.
Call him. Ask him to look at the story.
Why now?
Do you know who Ken Cosgrove is?
Hes an account executive, just like me.
Did you know that?
My father reads the damn Atlantic.
So what?
You dont want to be a writer.
I thought it was a hobby.
Hes out there.People know who he is.
Pumpkin, Charlie Fiddich?
Im surprised.
You can tell what this means to me.
You said youd do anything for me.
I dont understand you.
You were so upset when I told you.
Told me about what?
Peter.
Told me about what?
That he was my first.
Well...
this helps make up for that.
Let Charlie Fiddich...
see what hes been missing.
Okay.
- Good morning.- Oh, good morning.
Traffic meeting is startingin the conference room.
Really.
Cosgrove, Im serious.
I think it shows tremendous fortitude,
and Id like to see more of it around here:
People finishing things.
I guarantee you that in the bottom drawerof every desk in this place
- is the first ten pages of a novel.- Five.
The story itself was not much to my liking,
but I think it showedan uncanny understanding
of what most people like.
I guess so.
What did you get paidfor that, a hundred bucks?
About that.
Well, thatll keep you working here.
So, Miss Holloway,
would you like to take the reins?
Lets start with Maytag. Mr. Cosgrove.
Do you want to complainabout the copy,
now that youre a big writer?
Production needs 50% up front,
and were waiting on a check.
And when will you be callingthe client about that?
Well, I spoke with him last week,
and Ill check with himagain this afternoon.
Arent you good?
Rio de Janeiro.
The double-page spreadwe ran in Life and Town & Country
was so successful,
they want to resize the adto run in Readers Digest.
Big ad.
Little magazine.
Sals problem.
Lucky Strike?
Don?
Sales are great. Lawsuit is pending.
Youre the one whossupposed to keep an eye out
on whats happening in Washington.
After the election.
Im sorry. Do you mind?
Ill take any excuseto get out of this meeting.
His name is Adam Whitman.
Tell him, uh...
Where is he?
Reception.
I should, uh... I have to deal with this.
Sure, sure.
You better come back, now.
- I got this.- Okay.
Can I help you?
Can I help you?
Its you.
Its really you.
Dick.
I cant believe it.
I dont know what youre talking about.
I know Im grown up, but, Dick, its me.
Its Adam.
Your little brother?
Its Don.
It says Donald Draper,but I knew it was you.
Are you upset? Are you mad at me?
I dont even know who you are.
I know I look different.
I grew up tall, okay?
But its me, Dick.
Look, Im a janitor at American Calculatorin the Empire State Building,
and I found this is someones trash.
I thought I saw a ghost.
I think youve mistaken mefor someone else.
You cant even look at me.
Okay. Youre at work.
I can come back another time.
No.
Theres a coffee shopthree blocks west of here.
Deelite.
Ill meet you there at noon.
Thats swell.
And everythings all setfor the Liberty Capital meeting?
Yes, of course, all set.
Well, thank you all.
Im glad everybody can make it soundlike theyre working so hard.
I cant believe this.
It is really you.
What do you want from me?
I dont understand this.
You have nothing to say to me?
Nothing to ask me?
Dick, I thought you were dead,and youre right here.
Thats not me.
Cant you even say my name?
Adam...
thats not me.
It is.
What happened to you?
Why did you do that?
Why did you leave me?
I couldnt go back there.
Nothing for me.
I knew you werent dead.
I knew I saw you that dayhiding in the window in your uniform.
I was only 8, but I knew it was you.
It was a long time ago.
I cant believe...
When I saw that picture in the paper,
I thought, "It looks exactly like him,except around the eyes. "
Donald Draper?
What kind of name is that?
What difference does it make?
People change their names.
Yeah, I guess.
What happened to her?
Mom?
She wasnt my mother.
She never let me forget that.
Shes gone.
Stomach cancer.
Good.
Uncle Mack took it pretty hard.
He passed, too.
Are you sure you dont want anything?
I know. Ive got this lump in my throat.
Id love to eat right now, but I cant.
Did you miss me at all?
Of course I did.
Its good to see you.
You look well.
Would have rather had lunch with you.
I know. But I have an appointment
with the decoratorfor our new apartment.
Another time, I promise.
You said you enjoyed the story.
Yes, I did.
As much as anyone canenjoy that kind of thing.
So you like it, or you didnt like it?
It doesnt matter.
It matters that I publish it, right?
Yes. It does.
Have you been seeing Laura still?
Yes.
Shes terrific.
Fun.
She really is.
Trudy, I want to talk to you
about something that hasnothing to do with this.
Okay.
I miss you.
I miss being with you.
Thats very sweet to hear.
I know youre married.
It doesnt have to be morethan just being with you.
I cant.
Charlie, I...
No. I cant. Im a newlywed.
Maybe... like in some movie,
sometime in the future, when were old.
Maybe then.
I want you now. I dont want you old.
I want you now.
I know youll never leave him.
I can keep a secret.
No, Charlie.
Please.
Sally, dont run.
Okay!
Hello.
Hello.
My goodness,youre Mrs. Draper, arent you?
Hello. You must be Peggy.
I recognized your voice.
So nice to finally meet you in person.
This is Sally and Robert.
Were here for our portrait.
Of course.
I guess I knew that.
Is he in there?
Um, not right now, but please go inside.
Ill be right back.
Joan?
Oh, my God, Joan, I need your help.
Let go of me.
Mrs. Draper is here,
and theyre having their portrait taken,
and he snuck out,and I dont know who to lie to.
Calm down. Just breathe slowly.
Mr. Draper is out,
and I dont think Im supposedto know where he went.
- That happens.- But theyre taking their pictures today,
and I would have reminded him,
but he slipped out before I could.
Its his fault. He comes and goesand never says anything.
Where is he?
I make an excuse to Mrs. Draper,she could catch him in it,
especially if she just leaves.
Or even worse, then hell know
that I know where he was.
Where is he?
I dont know.
You do know,
and youre going to tell me,
or Im not going to tell you what to do.
- I cant believe you.- Well?
He sees this woman.
He saw her the other day.
He came back all greasy and calm.
No.
Oh, God. Now Ive told you.
Im the worst secretary in the world.
- Who is she?- I dont care. Please hurry.
Peggy, use your noodle.
Youre making this so complicated.
You go out there,and you entertain her and her brats.
Get some Hershey bars from the cart
and tell her you dont know where he isand you forgot to remind him.
It is the truth. And when he comes back,let him have an excuse.
Hell have one.
And then you just start apologizing
for, well...
just how stupid you are.
Its probably what I would have done anyway.
Oh, God, now I really shouldnt have told you.
You shouldnt have told me.
Im not gonna tell anybody,
but you shouldnt have told anybody that.
This isnt how I imagined it.
Im sorry.
You keep saying youre sorry.
Where were you all this time?
Around. Here, mostly.
Im not mad at you.
I just want to know.
I mean, look at you.
Who is Donald Draper?
I mean, do you have a wife?
Kids?
Im going to go.
Thats it?
Want me to pay for lunch?
- No.- Let me.
You didnt have anything.
I dont understandwhy youre being like this.
When I was little,
I used to imagine this day happening,and here it is.
I dont understand. Im family.
I just want to be a part of your life.
Adam, thats not going to happen.
Im going to walk out that door.
Thats it.
Im not buying your lunch...
because this never happened.
I dont like black licorice, either.
Are you sure we should wait?
I think so.
I cant believe I forgot.
Oh, are you missing your lunch?
No. Its okay. I brought it.
Well, youll probablybe going out tonight.
Might as well take it easy.
Thats true.
Do you have a boyfriend or a steady?
Um, no.
I work a lot.
Some blind dates.
I remember those.
- The disappointments.- Yeah.
Mr. Drapers office.
Hows it going?
No, thank you. Im staying in.
- Mr. Draper treating you well?- Yes.
Hes been very patient
while Ive been learningthe ropes around here.
Dont you just hate itwhen his mouth runs on and on?
Excuse me?
Im joking.
You probably know moreabout him than I do.
You look so beautiful in that light.
You should takethe picture right there.
Well, I... I did want to look good.
Mr. Draper. Im...
The portrait.
What happened? Where were you?
We were just about to leave.
Im so embarrassed.I forgot to remind you.
No, I forgot to check inbefore I went to the printer.
Im such a fool.I dont know where my head is.


Im so sorry, Mrs. Draper.
- Please forgive me.- No, its nothing.
All we need are some wet paper towelsto get the chocolate off
before we go in front of the lens.
Well have to do that on the way.
They must be waitingfor us at the studio.
Come on.
Nice to meet you.
Dont worry about it.
Thank you.
Theyre terrible.
No, theyre not.
Don was late.
It ruins the whole thing.
Oh, Carltons always late.
You can see whats important to them.
Were very important to them. Stop it.
Howd you like to bein Helen Bishops family portrait?
Theres a big hole there, believe me.
I want to take them again anyway.
Sally looks fat.
I dont think so.
The worst part is,Don will think theyre fine.
Here. Maybe this one.
Blow that one up.
Itll hold you until the Christmas card.
The color is off on these, too.
Am I wrong?
I really expect the royal treatmentwhen I go to Dons office,
and I seldom get it.
Its like walking into another countrywhere I dont speak the language.
At Carltons, I feel like Im stupid.
All that Manhattan talk.
Our husbands.
They are better out here, arent they?
Infinitely.
We took your idea of productand applied it directly to the bank.
Banking products,not household products.
You said banking productswerent sexy.
We went downsome really dumb roads,
like bank accounts for children,
and then Don, here,
had this Roman candle of an idea.
Don?
I think Paul has a handle on this.
The modern executive is a busy man.
He leads a complicated life.
He has business expenses, family, leisure.
How are you supposedto keep all that straight?
Well, now Liberty Capitalis going to help you with that.
Okay.
What is this?
An account for a man that is private.
The statements come to the office,not your home.
I see. For organizing your life.
If it needs it.
Liberty for the libertine.
Thats good.
Does this say that to you?
It will if you put the word "private" in thereinstead of "liberty. "
Executive Private Account.
What are you laughing at?
A portion of our customersare already, I believe, doing this.
Theres just no name for it,
and we had no way to charge them.
I like the torch.
It says, dont get b*rned.
It could start some uncomfortableconversations
in a lot of homes, but, uh...
its better than a calendar.
Lets talk placement.
Hello.
I opened everything but that one.
One is about a roughneck on an oil rig
who has to move to Manhattanbecause his wifes mother is sick.
The other is about...
You know, I just finished reading it.
Its really a great story.
Thank you. That means a lot.
Its nice to seesomeones passion be rewarded.
You know what?
I dont have a copy of it,
and I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.
Hey!
You said you got, like,50 more copies, right?
Maybe I do.
If not, its on every newsstand in town.
Good to hear.
Youre leaving?
Yes. For the day.
Oh, okay.
Im going home.
You can reach me there if necessary.
Ive always wonderedwhy hes ignored me.
Probably because hes so good-looking
he can go outside the officefor whatever he wants.
Most of these fellas cant.
He seemed different to me.
Well, either way,you have to do your job.
Keep his record clean here and at home.
Honestly, if he sees that in you,you are solid gold.
Thats my job?
Yes.
Thats his private life.
Private.
Thats how these men are.
And its why we love them.
I dont love him.
Fine.
Look, if youre even thinkingabout passing judgment,
then youre in the wrong business.
Okay.
You need to relax.
I have never come over here
and not seen you with a look on your facethat said "I need a drink. "
This job is odd.
But its the best.
Listen, Kenny.
What?
Listen, I know Ive been a bear,
but Ive been competing neck and neckwith people in this place.
I didnt know I wascompeting with you, too.
You lost.
Hello, sweetheart.
Hello, dear.
Well... I have some good news.
Charlie Fiddichcame by the house this afternoon.
Did he? Here?
I guess your lunch did go well.
It wasnt lunch. I told you that.
So what did he say? Dont tease me.
He said he was goingto get you published.
That is incredibly swell news.
When? Where?
Boys Life magazine.
What?
Its a $40 fee,
and a lot of people read it.
Are you kidding me? Boys Life?
That story was good enoughfor The New Yorker.
And dont act like those magazinesdo everything on merit.
I thought youd be happy.
For a years work.
You dont want me to have what I want.
Youre going to be published.
Boys Life.
Probably next to some ad for exploding cigars.
I could have gotten youin The New Yorker
or in the Encyclopedia Britannica
if I wanted to.
So...
why didnt you?
Why would you do that to me?
Why would you put me in that position?
I talked to my fatherabout the house in Cape May.
He said our dates are good.
August wont be a problem.
Thats good.
I wish it wasnt so far from the city.
Then wed see more of you.
Its not that far.
Well, I hate youspending August in the office.
Although I liked your girl Peggy.
Shes fresh.
As the driven snow.
You sound disappointed.
Did you read some terriblearticle in Look magazine
that I should know about?
I like her.
A woman cant just not remarkon her husbands secretary.
Don, are you okay?
No, I just might haveto go back to the office.
I havent decided yet.
Phone!
Hello.
I need to see you tonight. Are you busy?
For you? Of course not.
Good. Im leaving now.
From where?
25 minutes.
I dont even know what you drink.
Whatever you have.
Im so glad you changed your mind.
Come in.
Sit down.
I know its terrible.
Its temporary, I... I hope.
Look at you.
You look more like you now.
I came here becauseI wanted to talk to you
and explain something to you.
You got to stop that kind of talk.
This isnt so hard.
Adam, listen to me.
I have a life,
and it only goes in one direction:
Forward.
What are you drinking?
Gin?
I found it in oneof the offices, under a couch.
Three quarts.
I figured I could take one.
Coffee.
I can do that.
So no Abigail, no Uncle Mack.
Nobody, huh?
I know. Its strange.
Your office is really nice.
I figure from that awardyou must be pretty important.
I dont know. I guess so.
Well, everyone always saidyou were too smart for your own good.
Of course, Uncle Mackthought you were soft.
But youre not, are you?
No, Im not.
What are you doing?
Thats $5,000.
Thats all there is.
I want you to take it,and I want you to leave New York,
and I dont want to seeor hear from you ever again.
Thats not what I wanted.
Thats not right.
Thats all I can do for you.
Youre serious, arent you?
You thought I was dead.
Just go back to thinking that.
Where do I go?
Adam, it is $5,000.
Make your own life.
I have too much here.
Its going to be okay.
Howd it go?
Crisis averted?
Yes. Papers were on my desk.
Do you want to go visit the kids?
No, I just want to go to sleep.
I want to talk to you about something,
and I dont want you to get upset.
I wont.
I know you hate going to my familyshouse in Cape May,
and I know even though my father...
No, its great. Its great.
Im looking forward to it already, I swear.
But I know you dont likethat my father might be there for part of it.
I just dont likethe way he looks at me.
You took away his little girl.
I was thinking maybe we shouldjust buy a summer house.
Something closer thats ours.
I know we had a good year.
I dont know, Bets.
I think Cape May will be fine.
Were not that flush right now.
Theres nothing to be worried about.
Id just rather wait till next year.
Good.
Because I like seeing my dad.
