Sounds like the place.
I couldn't believe there were two parties on this block.
I have no problem with Negroes.
I'm just worried about the car.
We can still go home. This was your idea.
It's important that we're here, for you.
For the people that work for you.
Lovely, go easy on that.
Some of them don't feel that way.
Is my nose running?
- How are you? - Hi.
Sorry about that, buddy.
What did you do with your coats?
We left them in the car.
When we called to get directions from somewhere else in New Jersey,
Paul gave Harry the idea.
I took my purse.
I can smell alcohol, but I don't see it.
It's him.
It's a party.
Cosgrove's doing great.
Let's go get a drink.
I'm going to stay here.
Come with me.
So you work for these stuffed shirts?
I work with them.
Peggy. Glad to see a familiar face.
Yes. How are you?
Introduce us to your friend.
Eugene, whom I just met,
was telling me that at Princeton
Paul used to dress up like a girl.
According to him, that's the way Shakespeare did it.
Looking stunning, as always.
Much too good for him.
What are you doing out here?
Not enough subterraneans in the Village?
I'm here because this isn't Greenwich Village.
This is America.
How do you get to the city?
The number    bus takes you right to Port Authority.
Trust me, Montclair is the knees.
We have Globe Trotter Antiques.
We have the Wellmont Theater.
Silent movies with organ.
The Montclair Art Gallery.
George Inness. Have you heard of him?
Of course I have.
Come.
Enjoy.
Imbibe.
You're a button, you know that?
And you're drunk.
Can't get Donna here on my desk because she keeps refusing.
You're not allowed to do that.
I can't feel my cheeks.
I can.
I feel them fine.
My mother says when you can't feel your cheeks,
it's time to stop.
Well, what do I do with this?
There. That works.
Oh, my God.
Don't you and Kitty have some place to be?
Apparently, when they say "on call,"
it does not mean "available by phone."
You have to be in the hospital.
I'm sorry he didn't make it.
I'm looking forward to meeting him.
I've been having this pain right here.
You've met him.
How could I forget?
Big, handsome, saves people's lives.
Why did you get the nice glass?
Because I have the RhÃ´ne Gallagher.
Fine. What is it?
There's a ship that went down in     ,
and the casks of RhÃ´ne were on it.
It was a very good year.
And it sank,
and they washed up on shore two years ago,
and they sold     bottles,
and I have one.
But not a sofa.
Joan, I want you to meet someone.
My baby... Sheila.
Sheila White.
Joan is our senior secretary.
Office manager.
Sheila's an assistant manager.
At the Food Fair in South Orange.
She's saving for school.
- Kinsey! - What?
The man upstairs is here.
God?
No. It's Mr. Hoffenberg.
He wants to talk to you.
He smells marijuana.
Don't talk until I get back.
I'm serious.
I don't think we have a Food Fair in Manhattan.
Is it a big market with a parking lot?
It is.
Well, one day you'll drive in
in a station wagon and be a customer.
I grew up out here.
I've already been a customer.
It's fun to meet the boys, put faces with names.
Well, it's good to see you and Paul together.
I have to say, when Paul and I were together,
the last thing I would have taken him for was open-minded.
I love your purse.
Thanks. I just got it.
What's that?
Marjorie. Works at the newsstand.
I like.
But behind her.
You stole that.
That's from the office.
That dumb girl almost got fired.
But she didn't.
I'm a writer. I need it.
Hey, Brooklyn, come home with me.
Why not? I live alone.
Why should I?
Because I like you, and we're having a good time,
and I'm a good kisser,
and you know you want to.
Eugene.
I'm in the persuasion business,
and frankly, I'm disappointed by your presentation.
Come on.
Fifth Avenue's a parking lot, in both directions.
Traffic makes the parade look bigger.
What parade?
Colonel Glenn.
It's incredible what passes for heroism these days.
I'd like ticker tape for pulling out of my driveway
and going around the block three times.
It's not like people were sh**ting at him.
I think he's a winner.
Square jaw, false modesty.
Looks like he just took off his letterman jacket.
You going to go down there with your autograph book at lunch?
Can I just fire everyone?
Excuse me!
This is a place of business.
Colonel Glenn will be on Earth for the rest of his life.
Plane went down.
American Airlines Flight   to Los Angeles.
Crashed in Jamaica Bay.
...had suddenly become locked in a death dive into the bay...
There could be a hundred people on there.
Just fell out of the sky.
...turn prescribed by Idlewild Airport rules.
The Federal Aviation Agency said there is no rational basis
for grounding the Boeing     as a result of the crash.
Federal Aviation administrator Najeeb Halaby
...of the investigation said there was no...
Pull all Mohawk ROP.
And anything in production, stop it.
But it wasn't a Mohawk plane.
We don't want people opening their morning paper
and seeing a Mohawk ad next to a picture of a floating engine.
The rest of you, stop crying
and figure out how we're going to hit the ground running
in three weeks with new work.
Excuse me.
Well, for one thing,
we should probably avoid the term "hit the ground."
How about "Idlewild to Rockaway in less than eight minutes"?
Answer the phone, sweetheart.
- Some of the passengers... - Sterling Cooper.
...were on their way to a golf tournament.
Apparently, the minute the plane hit,
the bay turned plaid.
Get back to work.
Jets are made for dropping b*mb on Moscow,
not French cuisine.
Although I like those little girls they have.
You know, they're completely captive.
Mr. Phillips to see you.
Send him in.
Someone should tell Draper to pull everything from Mohawk.
He knows that.
I just had an interesting conversation with Shel Keneally.
He's inside of American Airlines.
Is the plane still crashed?
Shel was a client when I was at Y&R in London.
We had some times together.
It's complete chaos over there.
They have any idea what went wrong?
None.
Normal takeoff, perfect weather.
The thing just nose-dived, exploded.
That's not comforting.
Shel says they're going to need to make a fresh start.
Did he say "fresh start"?
A few times.
That is an interesting phone call.
Yes.
I can't talk right now.
Mr. Campbell, are you all right?
Mr. Campbell?
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?
What's going on?
I just got off the phone with my brother.
It's the strangest thing.
Apparently, my father was on that plane.
What?
My father, he was on the plane.
God, I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't know what to do.
I just saw him at the barber.
Paul Molé on Lex.
What does one do?
Make arrangements, I guess.
What am I supposed to do?
What people do.
Go home.
I don't even think I know how old he was.
Someone's going to ask that.
I don't know. I suppose.
You know what?
I don't think I'm going to tell anyone.
Am I going to cry?
You just had a shock.
I wouldn't...
worry about what you're feeling.
Go home and be with your family.
Why?
Because that's what people do.
Is that what you would do?
Yes.
Really?
Yes.
Everything's exactly the same.
You should go home.
What about the Stouffer's meeting?
I'll cancel it.
It's not hurting anything.
There's life, and there's work.
Hey, I got one.
"Mohawk Airlines...
When you need to make it past Jamaica Bay."
How about "American... pioneering vertical flight"?
Mr. Draper, Mr. Cooper would like to see you.
I spoke with Hank Lamont over at Mohawk.
How are they doing over there?
He says they can weather it out.
I always get the feeling
that man opens his front door and money comes in.
Always cleaned me out.
Best poker player in the South Pacific.
Duck, tell Don here about your phone call.
Well, I put in a call to check in with Shel Keneally
over at American Airlines.
He used to run International. We're old pals.
He picked up the phone?
What's going on over there?
Shel says it's bedlam.
Anyway, he was quite clear about the fact
that they're going to want to make changes
if they want the dust to settle fast.
What does that mean?
It means they'll be looking for a new image
and thus a new agency.
What's it been, four, three hours
since the plane went down?
You'll have to forgive me
for not looking at a bunch of bodies in Jamaica Bay
and seeing the opportunity.
Adding a few hours or a day or a week
doesn't make this any more of an opportunity.
- We already have an airline. - We don't have American.
That's right, we have the one whose planes
didn't just fall out of the sky.
That's good.
I'm sorry. Is there an issue?
$  million. $  million.
Am I missing something?
Did you sign American during this phone call?
No, but Shel made it very clear
that if we can get rid of our conflict, he'd love to hear our ideas.
It's a serious foothold.
A foothold. I'd do anything for a foothold.
This is how it works.
We got a regional airline so we'd have a sh*t at a big one.
I know how you had it in your head.
The President of American Airlines sees a Mohawk ad,
falls in love, and says "Get me that guy."
I'm sorry it didn't play out that way.
Easy.
We have a good client who trusts us, who likes our work,
who pays their bills on time.
They don't deserve to be thrown out the door
for a wink from American.
I can't believe this.
Anything else?
He'll be fine.
I'll need to cancel my reservations to Sarasota
and, of course, Andrew's return flight.
But I... Well, they can't possibly expect...
I'm sure that's taken care of.
Dunham's taking care of all that.
Bud's on the phone with him right now.
I'm sure he'll forget something.
There's no way that he can remember everything.
Bud's very good with things like this.
Is he aware there is no way to have a funeral without the remains?
What's the difference?
You're right.
There's just so much to do.
What is that?
What?
That.
What is that?
Take it.
I want you to have it.
He was such a fine man,
so well-mannered, civic.
My father admired him.
What a nice thing to say.
I like to offer a nice bouquet of thoughts.
Did you take care of everything?
They do this all the time.
- What? - I took care of it.
Give me another one of those, a big one.
Dunham had some unpleasant news.
Dad was insolvent, broke.
Is there enough for a funeral?
As if the idea of a will never crossed your mind?
We weren't going to get that.
You weren't.
What about her money?
The Dykeman Trust isn't as solid as one would hope.
A lot of loans were taken out by the president...
and recipient... Daddy.
Really? For what?
I asked Dunham if there was a woman.
He said no.
It's all oysters, travel, and club memberships.
Does she know?
You want to tell her? Go ahead.
Everything's been taken care of.
Boys.
Father called you salt and pepper.
That's beautiful, Dot.
Hi, Daddy.
I made you a ham sandwich.
What is this?
Carlton and Francine are coming over for cards.
Oh, Bets. Didn't we just do that?
We haven't done it since before Christmas.
And they keep inviting us, and we never go.
- Can I play cards? - I want to play.
I'm going to lie down for a minute.
I have the chenille bedspread on.
Pull it back or they'll see the marks on your face
and know you were sleeping.
You can say hello to everyone, then it's off to bed.
Muddled. That means smash it.
He'll be nicer on the second one.
You did a wonderful job on mine.
Thank you.
Go take Mommy and Francine's orders.
Bobby, that is your last one.
All right. Come on, go.
Watch TV.
They're growing like weeds.
That's true.
We have the Caruthers girl over to baby-sit already.
Can you believe that?
I don't think we know her.
You'd remember.
Goes to Immaculate Heart.
I've been out of high school a long time,
but honestly, the way these girls dress,
and those uniforms.
Carlton.
What?
I'm enjoying this story so far,
but I have a feeling it's not going to end well.
I think that Francine brings her in to torture me.
I mean, everything I do rubs her the wrong way.
I got rid of the apartment in the city.
I'm taking her to Nassau.
There was a pie cooling in the windowsill,
and I'm not even supposed to smell it?
It's Darkness at Noon.
- What do you want to hear? - Now, come on.
Don't be like that.
Two Tom Collins.
Okay, you don't smash the cherry on that.
Just plop it in at the end.
Try to keep it in the top of the glass.
Gin.
Oil issues showed some signs of life today
when the Department of the Treasury
announced plans to ease import quotas on residual oil.
By the end of the day, Texaco added  / , Shell...
Oh, good, you didn't wait.
We couldn't. It's late.
Work.
Your hair looks nice.
It does,
and she fought with Mr. Pierre every minute of it.
He's got some funny ideas.
You want something to eat?
No, thank you. I already ate.
Connie Griffin was in her yard,
hanging laundry in Bergen Beach.
She saw the whole thing.
Can you imagine?
WOR said there were sharks eating the v*ctim.
That's worth reporting.
You want toast?
Mama, I already ate.
You say you're coming to dinner, and you already ate?
I came because I wanted to see you.
We never see you.
I'm here. Right now.
Such a pretty face.
Gladys Rhine was asking for you at church.
Babe saw your brassiere ads in the newspaper.
You should see poor Donny. His skin is horrible.
Clearasil.
- He's beyond that. - It's a shame.
He's a handsome boy.
Lots of people was asking me about you.
Doesn't mean the same thing to me that it means to you.
I think your father would like it if you lit a candle for him.
I pray for you.
You know she lies and tells people you're out of town on business.
She has some made-up church in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,
where you go to mass with a friend of hers.
No one asked her to lie.
She's not going to be here forever.
Would it k*ll you to go?
I don't want to.
And I'm capable of making my own decisions.
Really? State of New York didn't think so.
The doctors didn't think so.
Did you bring the vacuum?
Yes.
Did you empty the bag?
Yes.
How do you let her get away with making a bid of    ?
She usually overbids. How was I supposed to know?
I do not overbid. I'm cautious.
I hear it's going to be a row of apartments
all up Cedar Lane.
No more cedars.
No parking around the school.
You know, I could've had that property for a song?
A song and a half, tops.
I thought he was crazy, but there you go.
I'm sure we have something else to talk about.
Did you hear about that jetliner?
Terrible. It's terrible.
I was supposed to fly to Cleveland.
Now I can't. I have to take the train.
Nine hours.
You have got to be kidding.
Sorry.
I love the train. You do, too.
Bobby.
Go back to bed.
I'm scared. I heard something.
Everything's great. Go back to bed.
Bobby.
Come on.
Do what your mother says.
When I was a child,
I would've been way more afraid of my father
than of going to sleep.
I hated going to sleep when I was a kid.
But I bet you did when you were told.
With a stack of comics and a flashlight.
I don't care what they do when they're up there.
I just like a few hours of quiet.
Ernie tests my patience.
Said he saw a ghost.
He was scared.
He's a little liar.
He is?
He drew the most amazing picture of George Washington the other day.
His teacher was so impressed,
she put it up in the hallway.
It really looked like him.
Well, obviously.
Because he brought it home,
and I noticed the exact same image of Washington
on the cover of one of his books.
He had traced it.
What happened?
He brought a book to school so he could trace it?
Well, I don't know. Maybe they had it there.
I mean, the point is it was dishonest.


My whole art department is run on tracing paper.
Why reinvent the wheel?
I've got the rest.
I don't care about tracing.
What about all that praise he accepted
for something he didn't do?
Well, the book says they start fibbing at this age.
They want to see if they can make it come true.
I don't need a book to know what little boys do.
You have anything you want me to take back to the library?
Anything you want me to pick up?
No. I have to renew The Agony and the Ecstasy.
It's taking forever.
I should go. I have to work tomorrow.
Busy bee.
Aren't you going to say good night?
Hi, Aunt Peggy.
Marilyn says Helen Bishop's trying to stop them
from putting parking meters at Depot Plaza.
Apparently, she got chummy with some administrator at the high school.
Big, fat fellow.
Carlton's put on a few.
I think it's nice he's filled out.
It shows he's happy.
I wouldn't say that.
Why not?
Did he say something? What did he say?
He didn't say anything.
Well, he should be happy.
Okay, maybe he is.
He should be happy and grateful and showering Francine with love
after what he put her through.
Look, Bets, I'm not going to fight.
I'll say whatever you think I should say,
but I'm not going to fight with you.
What, sweetheart?
You laughed. What's funny?
I just...
I was just thinking that the last conversation I had with him,
we were arguing about whether Barney Kellogg
bred Boston terriers or French bulldogs.
I'm sorry you were arguing.
Those ugly little pushed-in faces.
The labored breathing.
He said they were French bulldogs.
I said they were Boston terriers.
He was angry about it.
Oh, Peter, neither of you knew it was the last time.
Fighting about facts, my mother calls it.
We do it all the time.
Argue over something that's actually one thing or another.
What do Barney's dogs look like?
Just beige.
Kind of like pugs, but with big ears.
Those are French bulldogs.
Really?
When I woke up, I felt fine for a minute.
Then I remembered.
You should be thinking about the good times.
Right.
So they go out a third time,
and now the restaurant's even worse... Indian food.
But she really likes him.
I told you he worked for City Hall, for the Mayor.
- So what happened? - I need three copies.
One goes to Mr. Robinson, one to Mr. Fairbanks,
and one to Mr. Smith.
The strange one.
That doesn't narrow it down.
Thank you.
Mr. Kinsey.
Is something wrong?
I'm avoiding you.
Or haven't you noticed that after three days?
Are you worried about the typewriter?
I'm not going to tell anyone.
Although you were so brazen,
you don't deserve clemency.
What did you say to Sheila?
- Who? - Sheila.
My girlfriend.
Describe her to me.
Very funny.
I know what's first on the list.
Oh, my God, I knew you were a lot of things...
I'm not a phony.
You're so proud.
It's so obvious why you're seeing her.
A supermarket checkout girl?
Conversation must be stimulating.
Lettuce costs a nickel.
What a relief. You're just jealous.
Because you're the one who got away?
You, out there in your poor-little-rich-boy apartment
in Newark or wherever.
Walking around with your pipe and your beard,
falling in love with that girl
just to show how interesting you are.
Go ahead. What part is wrong?
Pete?
Duck. Come in.
Where's the girl?
She's supposed to tell me if she goes anywhere.
When my old man died, I went on a hell of a bender.
You heard about that.
I had to read about it in the Times.
I wish you felt that you could talk to me about it.
You should be able to. We're practically family here.
I don't know, Duck.
There's not a lot to say.
No. Of course not.
Your old man was in advertising, right?
Boston.
Used to talk about the '  s like we're idiots.
My father wasn't.
Of course, it turns out
I really didn't know anything about him
except that he did not like advertising.
Ah, that's his style. I'm sure he was proud of you.
Some people have trouble saying it.
Yes. That was a problem for him.
What's not to be proud of?
You pay attention. You're hungry.
Most of the time you know what you're doing.
I've noticed that.
I appreciate that.
Now, I don't want you to think I'm being insensitive,
but we're going after American Airlines.
Well, it's...
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
Okay.
I'm meeting at the University Club with Shel Keneally.
Tonight, actually. Get everything rolling.
If anything, I'd like you on board.
I want you leading the way on this thing.
I think I am uncomfortable.
I don't think I should do that.
It just happened.
I haven't even cried yet.
Of course.
It was inappropriate.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Can you come in here with the papers I asked for?
Sweetheart.
You mind?
I need you to set a meeting.
A quiet place, but public.
Have a heart-to-heart with Henry Lamont.
Why would I do that?
Because we're cutting him loose.
Duck's having a meeting with Shel Keneally
from American Airlines tonight.
He's letting them know that Mohawk is over.
And that gets us a pitch?
It sends a signal that we're serious.
And that we're willing to do whatever it takes.
He has nothing. And this is more of it.
- It's desperate. - Come on.
You should be salivating to rip these guys away from DDB.
And even if we don't win this account,
we're going to be on a list in the New York Times
of big boys pitching for this business.
We have an airline.
What kind of company are we going to be?
The kind where everyone has a summer house?
I can't believe I look like an idiot
for wanting to be loyal to these people.
Take off your dress.
You get a chance at American Airlines, you take it.
End of discussion.
Hildy, can you get my wife on the phone?
Of course.
Forget it.
Mr. Campbell.
Don. Do you have a minute?
What do you want, Campbell?
I just was... I don't know.
It's not a good time.
If you want, you can leave him a note.
People do that.
No.
Thank you.
Good night, Joan.
Did you see who did this?
No.
I never would have guessed you were in your   s.
People should not bring their personal problems
into the office.
I agree.
Is it so hard to just leave everything at the door
and just do your job?
I look forward to it.
They can't stand it.
They'll drag you into the garbage out there.
They just want you to be as miserable as they are.
I say let them have it.
Thanks.
How are you, Don?
Henry.
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?
You know, I'm glad you picked this place.
It reminds me of Pearl Harbor.
For many reasons.
Do you think you're not going to have to say it?
Sterling Cooper has decided
to end its relationship with Mohawk Airlines.
Sterling Cooper.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't my decision.
You know, when we came in there,
they all said Sterling Cooper is Don Draper.
That's what you get.
That talk you gave me about us growing together.
You said Sterling Cooper didn't need a big airline.
You were going to make us a big airline.
I wish things hadn't worked out this way.
I'm almost embarrassed to say this.
You fooled me.
Stockholders weren't remotely impressed with firing our head of ops.
So this agency change, well, that's going to be a process.
And to be part of that process?
- Listen, we're here talking, right? - Of course.
But it's hard for me to leave here comfortable
unless I know what your objections are.
Well, we're a few steps away from objections.
We're just sticking a toe in the water.
Well, we're not. We jumped in.
Pete.
It's good to see you.
Shel, this is Pete Campbell.
I don't think he's our best.
I think he's the best.
Pleased to meet you.
You as well.
I was just telling my buddy Shel here
how we've really cleared the way to be in this.
I was telling Duck here we don't know where we are yet.
I don't think you're aware
of the level of commitment and enthusiasm
for this project at Sterling Cooper.
It's true.
We've got writers bucking the gate.
I've already got a stack of ideas on my desk
that I think you'd love to see.
We understand how delicate
the process of rebuilding the public's confidence will be.
Not just the public. Our stockholders.
Well, I want you to know that,
should you decide to bring us your business,
there will be someone on your account
who knows exactly what you're going through.
My father was on that plane.
My goodness.
Sorry to hear that.
Yes. Well...
it's a horrible thing.
Hopefully, something good will come of it.
That is something I will pass on.
Shall we grab a bite?
I put our name in.
I'm not your waitress, but are you all set here?
Excuse me?
You've been sitting alone a long time.
Can I get you a menu?
I don't think so.
I have to drop this off,
but I can swing back around on my way out.
Not tonight.
Would you hold him for me?
Thanks.
