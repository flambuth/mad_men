Previously on Mad Men...
When we land Jaguar,the world will know.
Herb Rennet has demandedto spend a night with Joan.
This is some verydirty business.
I wanted to tell youits not worth it.
Tell them I want a partnership.Not silent.
I want all the partners here.
First thing tomorrow morning were goingto find you an apartment in the city.
- I need you right now.- Megan...
Its the only thingIm good for.
I think she just...needed her mother.
Im tired of trying to proveI still have a value around here.
Its what happens whenyou help someone...
they succeed and move on.
Dont you want them to?
Miss Calvet, could youstep in, please?
You know I love you.
Are you alone?
Thats it.
- Thats it, hang in there.- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
"Midway in our lifes journey,
I went astrayfrom the straight road
and woke to find myself alone
in a dark wood."
Mmm.
Mahalo.
Its still suite 282.
How long has it been?
Cant get too suntanned,theyll fire me.
Oh, you must havegotten it wet.
Let me see.
You know what?Who cares what time it is?
You would not have liked that.
You wouldnt haveliked it at all.
I had to walk down the beachaway from the crowds
to this surf shop and knockon a door with a closed sign.
It was so seedy down there.
Plus, I had to getmy money from here.
Come on.
I know youve tried it,but you havent had sex high.
It makes it so muchmore intense.
Everything you see on yourplate is what you would find
in a royal Hawaiian feast.
That purple pudding is poi.
Its strange, but satisfying.
And we Hawaiianssay that its ono,
which means tasty.
But you might just say,"Ono, Im not eating that."
This is real Hawaiian food.
Even the macaroni salad.
But, of course,at the Royal Hawaiian,
we try to treatevery guest like theyre--
Well, everythingis better here.
Im sure it is.
It must take a lot of workto stand out in paradise.
Don, you have to try this.
Oh, dont bother.Its wallpaper paste.
Just eat the pig.
Now, while you staywith us at the lovely,
beautiful Royal Hawaiian,
make sure you seeenchanted Diamond Head
and all of the naturalwonders of the island
by bus or by boat.
Its easy if you book
one of our guided toursin the lobby.
Aloha.
Come. Come dance.
Ive got nothingto do with this.
Go ahead, Don.
Leave him alone, honey.
I want to do it.
No, you have todo it like this.
You have to relax.
Get in the spiritof the islands.
They call methe Hawaiian Elvis.
Gentlemen, I remind you,
this is my job.
Stop laughing or Ill makethem come back for you.
Excuse me, Corinne.I hate to bother you.
I mean, I knowyour names not Corinne.
No, Its Megan Calvet.
- Oh, my goodness. Im reallybothering you. - No, not at all.
Youre so much trimmer than you are on TV.Do people tell you that?
- I-- no.- "To Have and to Hold" is my favorite.
I mean, I watch a few, andyoure obviously on vacation.
- Its okay. - Well, I know yourenew to "Berkshire Falls,"
but I can tell you--you just have a way.
Thank you so much.
Would you mind signingan autograph to my niece?
Shes a bigger fan than I am.
Id be delighted.
- Whats her name?- Karen.
Its like Corinne.
I cant believeVictor wont acknowledge you.
Well, well see what happens.
Enjoy your stay.
Those women really knew me.
One of them was from Minnesota.
I didnt even knowthey had the show there.
I love it here.
Hey, Galloway,you want another?
Can I get a tall beer?Chop chop.
So, mister,has he moved at all?
Well, youre either deador youve got great balance.
Hey, were you in the service?
I got the same one.
- What branch?- Army.
You can say that again.
- Korea?- Briefly.
Was Korea like this?
Cause Ill tell you, theyoffer you R&R in Honolulu
and you think, "Did anybodynotice its the same place?"
But Im glad to be here,I can tell you that.
You on your anniversary?
Folks have beenpretty friendly.
After all the shit that wenton last summer Stateside,
I was looking for a fight.
Thatd be classy-- showingup with a black eye.
This is my bachelor party.
Im getting married tomorrow.
Congratulations.Let me buy you a drink.
Nah, I got a shitloadof combat pay.
Let me buy you one.
You some kind of astronaut?
Im in advertising.
We got this .50 calibermachine g*n.
The M2.
You should see what it doesto a water buffalo.
Oh, my Lord. I couldpaint this place red.
How long do you have left?
Ceremonys at 0800.
Four hours or so.
No, in Vietnam.
Eight months.
Someone told hermarried guys live longer
cause they gotsomething to live for.
Shes from San Diego.
Shes Mexican.
She met me halfway in Hawaii.
I met her halfwayby getting married.
Were you marriedwhen you were in Korea?
No.
And you made it.
Listen, Lieutenant.
What do you saywe get into some trouble?
Its PFC Dinkins, by the way.
Its usuallyprinted right there.
Don.
So how do you feelabout giving away the bride?
You dont think yourfriends gonna make it?
Nah, hes my best man.
Her familys in San Ysidro.
And I dont want some hotelemployee being her dad.
They look just like the enemy.
Am I wrong?
Theres plenty of GIs here.Theres no one else you know?
Who gave your bride away?
Id love to help you out,but you dont even know me.
I think youd regret it later.
I believe in whatgoes around comes around.
One day Im gonna bea veteran in paradise.
One day Ill be the manwho cant sleep
and talks to strangers.
I, James, take you, Connie,for my lawful wife,
to have and to holdfrom this day forward.
For better or for worse,for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,
until death do us part.
What were you doing wrong?
Im so sorry, Officer.Its very hard to see.
Thats why youhave to drive slower.
We go easy on the speed limithere, but not with this ice.
I promise I will do thatin the future.
Im afraid this is aboutwhat you already did.
You may not be aware,but this is Betty Francis.
You may know her husband,my son, Henry Francis.
He works in the mayors office in Manhattan.Mayor Lindsay.
I work for New York State.Weve got our own mayor.
Ill do withoutyour sarcasm, young man.
Now, if you dont mind,
I think all concernedwill be very content
if you issue a stern warningand let us be on our way.
Pauline.
Im trying to avoid taking youoff the road with a shovel.
Shes driving like a maniac.
Yell at her.
I hate cops.
Nonsense. Theyre justdoing their job.
Well, theyre too enthusiastic.
That ruined it.That ruined everything.
I cant imagine it gettingany darker than this.
My moms dead.
How was "The Nutcracker"?
- The highlight of the evening.- Magical as always.
Well, Bobby, Gene, and Iare sorry we missed it.
Nothing like the ballet,right, boys?
Is Sandy sleeping over?
What do you care?
Isnt somebodygoing to say something?
Betty got a ticket.
For what?
I thought it wasgoing to be speeding,
but apparentlyits reckless driving.
I want you to tell your wife
that invoking your name in aninteraction with a state trooper
is nothing to be ashamed of.
Ma, it barely works for me.
Then Grandma Paulineyelled at him.
- I did nothing of the sort.- What did he do?
- He was verbally abusive.- Give him the ticket.
Hell fix it.He does it for everyone.
Ma, you know how I fixthose tickets?
I pay em.
- Can I open it?- Mm-hmm.
Get away, you little weirdo.
I like the case.It looks like a coffin.
Would you play a little?Thatd be nice.
I dont know.
Please. It makesme feel so much.
This is disgusting.Dont let them force you.
Have you been playing long?
- Shes going to Juilliard next semester.- Juilliard?
Why didnt you tell me we werein the presence of a prodigy?
15 is not a prodigy.
Sorry about that.Checking the steam.
- How was your trip?- Wonderful.
Warm.I did not miss this.
How are you feeling?
Let me in there.
Its okay, Jonesy.
- Jesus, whats his real name?- I dont know.
Open his coat.Open his coat.
Sylvia, call an ambulance.
Theres a phone at the desk.
Okay, Jonesy,keep listening to me.
Come on,I know you can hear me.
Come on.
Let me get those.
- Absolutely not.- Im surprised youre back at work.
Oh, the missus couldnt waitto get me out of the house.
- I dont believe it.- Oh, wait.
Messenger came withyour script yesterday.
I didnt let itout of my sight.
I got you a pretty nicebottle for Christmas
in case you cantread the handwriting.
Well, I hope you gotDr. Rosen a case.
I thought you were going tostop reading that before bed.
Its not bothering me tonight.
I bet it isnt.
Youre so calmfrom all that violin.
She plays beautifully.
You and Bobby had the same look onyour face when she was playing.
Shes a year older than Sally.Shame on you.
No one would blame me for leavingyou for a teenage musician.
Shes just in the next room.
Why dont you go in thereand r*pe her?
- Ill hold her arms down.- Betty, what the hell?
You said you wantedto spice things up.
Will it ruin it if Im there?
You know what? If you wantto be alone with her,
Ill put on my housecoatand take Sally for a ride.
You can stick a rag in her mouthand you wont wake the boys.
All right.All right, Betty.
My goodness.Youre blushing.
She left the sliding door open.
Theres dirt all over the rug.
Maybe she wantedto air out the place.
Im gonna take the cleaningout of her Christmas present.
One scene.
I take somebodys coatand offer them a drink.
Youre the maid.Its more than ours does.
One scene, Don. They sendme to pack suitcases.
Yours or theirs?
Victors.
Then Id be worriedif I was Victor.
I shouldnt have goneon vacation.
What are you doing up?
I couldnt sleep. I didntwant to wake Sally,
although you havethe creakiest floor.
Its an old house.At least turn on a light.
Are you hungry?
Are you gonna have something?
Yes,
but I really have to becareful this time of year.
Why?
Im trying to reduce.
Why dont you just be the way you are?Youre beautiful.
Thats charmingand you know it.
My mother worea girdle all the time
and she always had a stomachacheand I always thought,
"Youd rather have a stomachachejust so Dad will like you?"
Sandy,
my mother passed awaya few years ago
and I understand.
This time of yearis the hardest.
Oh, dear.
Were happy to includeyou in our family.
I cant go to Juilliard.
I know how youre feeling.
I was older than you,but I remember
when I went to Bryn Mawr,I was terrified.
- But then the minute I--- No.
I didnt get in.
They rejected me.
Oh.
Of course youd lie about that.
So youll try again next year.
Tell everyone you wantedto finish high school.
Its incredible how fastsome people come up with lies.
Please dont do that.
Im old for a violinist.
At least for oneas good as I am.
I dont care. All I wantedto do was go to New York.
In a few years.
But itll be too late.
My feet are alreadyin wet cement.
Plenty of girls do justfine without Juilliard.
Sure, you go to college,
you meet a boy, you drop out,
you get married,
struggle for a year in New Yorkwhile he learns to tie a tie,
and then move to the country andjust start the whole disaster over.
Thats an arrogantexaggeration.
You have so much.
I didnt ask for itand I dont need it.
You dont need it?
Do you know whatits like to have nothing?
- Do you?- Why do you keep insulting me?
Im trying to help.
No, arent you curious?
There are peoplein the Village.
I read about itand I even visited them.
You went to the city alone?Did Sally go with you?
No.
But she told me you went.
That you were a model.
Yes.
And I lived withfive girls in two rooms
and ate soup out of cans.
Its not glamorous.
But I bet it was great.
It was different back then.
There werent allthe riots and robberies.
Do you watch the news?
I visited this building
right off St. Marks Place.
And the kids are justliving and its beautiful.
You know?
People are naturally democraticif you give them a chance.
Are you on dope?
No.
- But--- But...
youre going to wait until youreold enough to live on your own.
Its two years.
Hardly a jail sentence.
You know, youre not my child,
so theres no reasonfor me to say this,
but I go to the symphonyquite a bit,
whether I like it or not,
and I am certainthat you are talented.
And on the bright side,
Sally was crushedyou were going away.
Want to use the bathroom?
- I think Im feeling better.- Im not.
- Theres Pepto-Bismol.- I think its too late.
I dont like vegetarian food.
Reminds me of Lent.
Exactly.Its a punishment.
- Hello?- Peggy Olson, please.
This is Peggy.Who is this?
- Did you watch Carson?- Who is this?
Its Burt.Burt Peterson.
Oh.Is everything okay?
Im calling you at midnight.Were screwed, Peggy.
Were at DEFCON 3. Wereabout to go to DEFCON 4.
DEFCON 4 is betterthan DEFCON 3.
Ive told you that.One is the worst.
- Then were at zero.- There is no zero.
Some comic on Carson was breaking everybodyup with this routine about the w*r.
Burt, its very late and yousound a little under the weather
and theres such a thingas free speech in this country.
I could give a hoot. Koss Headphoneswants to pull our Super Bowl spot.
He hates the line now.
"Lend me your ears"?Its Shakespeare.
Well, its somehow relatedto something.
The president.I dont know. I didnt see it.
You there?
Yes.
So you got to change your ad.
- Now its my ad?- He wants to meet for a discussion.
- About what?- I dont know. Something bad.
I take the clientsword for it.
- Youve got to call Ted.- About what?
I dont even knowwhat the problem is.
Its better coming from you.Ive got to go.
What time is it in Colorado?
I dont know. I cantdo any math right now.
I cant do any math at all.
Please, honey, dont talk.
Morning.
I guess I dont sayMerry Christmas to you.
Save that for Sylvia.How was Hawaii?
Long ago and far away.
Whats that camerayou guys are selling?
- Pentax?- Leica.
And which modelwill change my life?
Like everybody else, I onlyknow them by the price.
You know what?
Come by.
I got a closetful.Ill give you one.
Come on.Ill pay for it.
Id give oneto Christiaan Barnard.
I might just come by.
You owe me just forthat comment alone.
- You can come by right now.- No.
Im gonna be in surgery till 2:00.Maybe after.
Remember, you come by myoffice, I get to go to yours.
Another gloriousmorning, Dr. Rosen.
No good deed...
I dont know.
Probably part ofa deeper question.
Because, I mean, none of them arereally blonde anyway, right?
Shes 29 years old.
Hair darkens by that age,so shes probably a brunette.
Maybe she doesremind me of Jane.
No, I think its morethan just distraction.
I think youre beinghard on me.
You used the word"distraction."
Did I?Well, I need a vacation.
Im busy.Im a busy man.
I walk around that place,people say "Good morning" to me.
They dont really care. Theydont know anything about me.
Oh, God, Doc,what is it all about?
Help me.
I say--I say thats a joke, son.
- We discussed this.- What?
I cant laughat everything you say.
Either its funny or its not.
I dont know howyou can control yourself.
Its hard sometimes.We talked about that, too.
What exactlyare you joking about?
Youre obviously not afraidthat youre boring.
What are the events in life?
Its like you see a door.
The first time you cometo it you say,
"Oh, whats on the otherside of the door?"
Then you open a few doors.
Then you say, "I think I want togo over that bridge this time.
Im tired of doors." Finally yougo through one of these things
and you come out the other side andyou realize thats all there are--
doors and windowsand bridges and gates.
And they all open the same way
and they all close behind you.
Look, life is supposedto be a path and you go along
and these things happen to you andtheyre supposed to change you.
Change your direction. But itturns out thats not true.
It turns out the experiencesare nothing.
Theyre just some penniesyou pick up off the floor,
stick in your pocket, and yourejust going in a straight line
to you-know-where.
You sound afraid.
More like irritated.
And what do you thinkis causing that?
Top of the list, New Years.
Its like an extra birthday.
Youre supposed to blow out thecandle and wish for something.
I dont even know what it is.
How was your Christmas?
Same as the last five--ruined by work.
- How was yours?- Im a widower, Peggy.
Oh. Im sorry.
Apparently there was a bunchof jokes on the "Tonight Show,"
in question, about soldierscutting off ears in Vietnam.
And obviously we are gonna haveto go in another direction.
_
What did they say?
Well, I wasnt able
to obtain a copyor a transcript,
but Lawrence hereis a devout viewer.
I dont knowif I can do it justice.
Just shut up and do it.
Well, he came outand started talking about
how that surgeonin South Africa
transplanted a heart.And he says,
"Now I know what Im gettingPresident Johnson for Christmas."
- Who is this guy?- Im Lawrence.
- No, the comedian.- Were finding that out.
- You have no information.- We know the host was Phyllis Diller.
Get to the ears.
Well, I dont rememberhow he got to it,
but it was something about how
the first transplantsthey did were with dogs.
So obviously there could be somesort of mix-up or something.
Dads better, but he goes nutsevery time we run the can opener.
He hates the mailman or something.
And, oh, he keepsruining the carpet.
Only thing that stops him is hitting himon the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.
Do you rememberthe ear joke or not?
Well, he went backto Christmas.
Did you hear abouthow there are these GIs
with interesting decorations?
Cause they cut offthe Vietcongs ears
and wore them on a string aroundtheir neck like a trophy.
Oh.They really did that?
Theres a court-martial.
Did he actually say"Vietcong" on Carson?
I dont remember.This is the best I can do.
- I think youre very good.- You think so?
So, was that it?
No.The big laugh was
a general comes upto one of these guys
and says, "Thats notregulation, son."
The soldier says, "Pardon? Couldyou speak into my necklace?"
Biggest laugh even though thetransplant jokes were better.
Thats not even funny.What did Phyllis do?
She just said something like,
"I told you he wasa sick puppy."
When is Koss coming in?
1:00.Should I order lunch?
He loves the Russian Tea Room.
No, this isan emergency meeting.
I should probablypractice a little more.
The clients already seen it.
Go home.Theres no second show.
- What did Ted say?- I left a message.
I dont thinktheres anything to do
but work our way through100 versions of no.
Listen, dont getin your own way.
No, Ive seencreatives do this.
Ive seen Ted do it.This is the Super Bowl.
Its a lot of money. A lotof exposure for the agency.
- Theres probably awards down the road.- I know.
Believe me, I know.
The f*cking"Tonight Show."
Now, Peggy,I think its the Army
thats really at fault here.
You look tan.Did you have fun?
Im sorry,but your name escapes me.
Im Bob Benson.Im upstairs in Accounts.
Beloit College, Wharton MBA.
Secor, Mohawk, Life Cereal.
You know,but just in the outfield.
Yes, of course.
We spoke atthe Christmas party.
You seemed to know your wayaround Pennsylvania.
You want one of these?I get it right next door.
People will take a few extrasteps for a superior product.
Doesnt it belongto someone else?
No, I always get two.I dont want to share.
You know, I have through,
lets just saylow-level corruption,
obtained ticketsto the Cotton Bowl.
Crimson Tide versus Texas A&M.
You play football?
- Whats in that coffee?- Excuse me?
Oh.
Look, Ive been tryingto get to know your team.
Not that Im so important. Andthey talk about you all the time.
So I guess I figured a few minutesalone with you shouldnt be wasted.
Just a minute, Bob.
I smell creativity.
I love it down here.
I cant believe you just came offof 10 hours of plane travel.
- You look great.- No, Stan, you look great.
Changing the subjectever so slightly,
during your travels did younotice if the stewardesses
would let a mother hold a babyon her lap the whole ride?
I believe so.
- Ha!- Really?
Dont feel bad. I mean, how would you know?You never had any kids.
Last time you left town,it was in a covered wagon.
Because youre old.
Youre so tan.
- So how was the vacation?- He was on assignment.
On Waikiki Beach. How much workdo you think you got done?
Look at him. He has thesea breeze in his hair.
You bring me something?Huh?
Dictaphone, cocktail napkins?
Anything to give me a jumpon the Royal Hawaiian?
I had an experience.
I dont know howto put it into words.
Isnt Sheratoncoming in on Friday?
Hes still thinking.He just got back.
Ill tell you the experience.
Megan in a bikini.
Oh, Mr. Draper.There you are.
Good morning.How was your trip?
It was good, thank you.Whats going on here?
Theyre taking portraitsfor publicity.
You certainly look snappy.I see you have coffee.
I scheduled you later in case youmissed the connection in Los Angeles.
Everything went smoothly.
Welcome back.
Im jealousjust looking at you.
- I think youd like it.- I dont know if its the photographers
or the writers, but it reallysmells like reefer in here.
That has to be enough.
I think we got it.
So, they treat youlike King Kamehameha?
Miss, you mind?
Are these in color?
No, and Im startingto regret it.
Do you mind holding ontothe rail, gorgeous?
Think of important things.
Caroline, is theshoeshine here yet?
No ones goingto see your shoes.
- I want you to call him.- I did.
So, Don Ho...
did you have a blue drinkin the white sand?
Ernest Borgnine chase you downan alleyway with a switchblade?
I love that movie.
It was nice.
I think Im next, but I dontwant to follow that act.
So, you have anything readyfor Sheraton on Friday?
Have I ever walked intothis office after an absence
and not had you bring upbusiness immediately?
Thats only becauseIve spent every holiday
waiting on work from you.
And then you walk away from me.
And then you take a nap.
Oh, taking pictures.
Yeah, well be donein a second.
Keep it down out here.
Oh, about your office.
They think its betterfor the pictures.
I dont agree.
Theyll move it back.
So when I left, where was I?
Ill get you the files.
As horrible as this is,
I dont think anyonehas made this connection
outside of this comedian.
So its likely thatany possible controversy--
Well, no ones seenthe TV spot.
Theyve seen the printfor three weeks,
side by side withthe news story probably.
We havent heard a peep.
So the controversyis still in your imagination.
I wont deny that,but this is a horrible thing.
I believethats the word I used.
So?
- I thought I had a solution.- We cant pull the ad.
Relax, Burt.And of course we cant.
No, I thought maybewe could just cut
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,lend me your ears"
and just start with saying
all the great stuffabout the headphones.
Thats a great idea.
- You think so?- I think its the first idea, but--
It solves everything.
Except its just a man in a toga now.Its a non sequitur.
Maybe people will thinkits some kind
of sophisticated jokethat they just didnt get.
I think that while it avoids
any possibility of controversy,it neuters the joke.
What the hell does that mean?
Look, you dontknow what to do.
Im telling you what do to.
You are. You havesolved the problem.
But it needs morethan a solution.
It needs to be a great ad.
This is a great place to start.I just need a little time.
Remember how long it tookus to come up with this one?
I dont know. It just sortof came to you, didnt it?
No, you rejecteda lot of things.
And we cant sh**t one ofthe things I rejected?
We just dont have the time.
Look, my job isto introduce your headphones
to a huge, drunk,male audience.
And its not about my work,
its about making a great ad.
The associationnot being with Vietnam,
but with a laugh, a smile,
that all comesfrom your headphones.
I dont know how to do that.
But I do.
Give me a couple days.
Okay.
Youve got to geta hold of Ted.
Why do they allhave "love" in them?
- They asked for it.- Its a big word.
I guess they heardit on the news.
_
- What the hell is this?- Theyre newlyweds.
This couple doesnt exist.
Anything matrimonialfeels Paleolithic.
What are you suggesting? Alittle Haight-Ashbury colonial?
A couple of longhairs in love?Thatll get Dow going.
As much as Id like to joinall the ads making fun
of the ubiquitousSan Francisco hippie,
lets try to trade on the word"love" as something substantial.
I dont think thatspossible in this context.
So why are we contributing tothe trivialization of the word?
It doesnt belongin the kitchen.
"I love this.""I love my oven."
"You know what Id love? Id love ahamburger." Were wearing it out.
Lets leave itwhere we want it.
We want that electricjolt to the body.
We want Eros.Its like a drug.
Its not domestic.
Whats the differencebetween a husband
knocking on a door and asailor getting off a ship?
About 10,000 volts.
- Excuse me.- Oh.
- Dont let me interrupt.- No, we were...
just finishing up here.
These are great.
Good to hear.
- This is a pleasant surprise.- I got out early.
- Is that good or bad?- What?
Oh, no. Everythings fine.It was routine.
Well...
welcome to my hospital.
You want a coffee or something?
No.
This is quite a spread.
Well, lets get you set up.
If I looked like youand talked like that,
I wouldnt have hadto go to medical school.
Please, dont comparewhat I do to what you do.
Im not. Just part of me washoping that head was empty.
Cant resist cuttingpeople open, can you?
All right, enough flirting.Wheres my camera?
I think this is the best one.
I dont know what to say.
Say youre gonna bethe first American
to complete a successfulheart transplant
and that youll appear in a magazine adattributing your success to your Leica.
Well, if thats the only wayyou can give it to me.
- I was looking for you.- Here I am.
Dr. Arnold Rosen.
Sorry, this is Miss Chambers,my secretary.
Im sorry, Dr. Rosen. I didntknow you were coming by.
Oh, no, its not business.Hes a friend.
Theyre ready in your office.
- Who?- Theyre setting up.
- The photographer.- Ill do it.
No, youre gonna need acouple weeks with those instructions.
Thisll only take a minute.Have you had lunch?
No, I have a full afternoon.
But I think our wives are cookingsomething up for New Years.
Told Sylvia to keepit in the building.
Wasnt my idea.
No, itll be fun.
As long as I dont have to puton shoes, it sounds perfect.
And again, thanks for the toy.
See, but Im free tonight.
So call in sick.
Its easier for themto replace you than me.
Dont get out of bed yet.
Yes?
I hate to disturb you,but its very urgent.
Okay, okay, sit down.
I have to hang up. Lookslike something bad happened.
Well, let me know if yoursituation changes. Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Bye. Bye.
What the hell is going on?
I got some tragic news.You should sit down.
Ill be fine.
Here.
Your Aunt Jessica called.
Thats what I hung up for?
Your mother passed awaythis morning.
Caroline, honey,
she was 91 years old.
Its hardly a shock.
She was such a sweet womanand I know how close you were.
For 20 years, shes been sayingthis is her last Christmas.
She was always so polite to me
when she could hear me.
So I suppose Im in chargeof the arrangements.
You want to callyour aunt back?
Nah.Shes a fruitcake.
Shell want to have a séance.
Did she say what happened?
She had a stroke
in the bathroom.
Well, I asked, didnt I?
Talk to Joan.Shell know what to do.
Okay, okay.
Okay. Youregonna be okay.
Cheers.
Ah, yes.This is Peggy Olson
and Im callingfor Mr. Chaough.
Yes, this is Peggy Olson.
Lets not exaggerate.Ive only called twice.
Look, Father--
oh, Im sorry, Pastor.
I was raised Catholic.
Well, because my mother is.
My father is Lutheran.
Irish and Norwegian.
No, he passed away.
He was cremated.
Look, Pastor, Im not saying
that you didnt giveMr. Chaough the message,
Im just saying thatit bears some urgency.
Yes, which is to say I dontthink it would bother him at all
to know that Im on the phone.
Certainly.Do you have a pen?
This is Peggy Olson
and Im callingabout the Super Bowl.
Im in the office,he has the number.
How could you possibly havewritten that down that fast?
I dont know. I think its gonna beOakland or Houston against Green Bay.
And also with you.
Good night.
Phyllis, can I get some coffee?
Its gone cold.
Is this really necessary?
I just got back from Hawaii.
Youre backlit,
so even with the tan you looklike you havent slept.
Dont roll down the sleeves.Roll them up.
- Really?- You know what, Chico?
Forget the tripod.Give me the camera.
Ahem.
What do I do?
I want to see you lostin that confident thought.
I want to see the brainsbehind this operation.
Well, for one thing,Id be behind the desk
and my deskwould be over there.
Just do what you do.
Give me a minute.
Thats good.
_
_
Whats wrong?
Give me a little"Front Page."
You know, hands on the desk lookingfor an answer out that window.
What?
What do you want?
I want you to be yourself.
Sorry to wake youwhen youre finally sleeping,
but I waited as longas I could.
What time is it?
They called me and theywant me to work today.
I told them about the funeral, butthey cant move it to tomorrow
because theyll need methen, too.
In fact, they need mefor the rest of the week.
Thats good, isnt it?
I called Jeff Hunter, but I thinkhis service wont wake him.
Isnt an agentsupposed to call you?
Good news will keep.
I feel awful about the funeral.
Will you please give Rogermy condolences?
Of course.
You should get some sleep.
How can I?My wifes a big TV star.
Get some sleep.
Break a leg.
Why are you eating? Sandyscoming over for lunch.
First of all, I dont knowwhy youre counting my meals.
And second of all,Sandys not coming over.
Oh.Thats a shame.
Is she sick?
Sick of being here.
She went to Juilliard early.
She did?
When?
Did you want her to saya tearful goodbye to you?
Well, frankly, yes.
Consider yourself lucky.
She was so stuck-up.
She kept saying howshe really was going
to "look backon this time fondly."
I cant believe she did that.
She acts like shes 25because she uses tampons.
Sally, please.
Did she give you her address?
Can you drive Jackieand me to the movies?
This is a great vacation.
You know, she was likea sister to me.
A much older sister.
How she could have a boyyour age, I dont know.
You could be her grandson.
You need toget your eyes checked.
- These are stunning rooms.- Thank you.
He is so handsome.
I swear you havenot aged a day.
Oh, Jane, darling.
- Thank you for coming.- I thought I should.
Excuse me. Excuse me.I would like to speak first.
I think you just did.
No, the eulogies.The remarks.
- I wish to go first.- Of course. Of course.
If you need to speakto me, I understand.
Thank you for rescuing me.
- From your admirers?- You look wonderful.
I dont know if you remember,but I have her ring.
I dont knowif you want it back.
What am I gonna do with it?
For Margaret or...
I dont know,to bury her in it.
We already b*rned her up.They steal that stuff anyway.
Just keep it.She liked you.
You always paidyour rent on time.
Do you want the victualsin the parlor?
What?
Hold on, I didnt orderany of this.
Its supposed to betea and petits fours.
Oh, hell, put itin the dining room.
- Im really sorry for your loss.- She was a great lady.
"Bob Benson, SCDP."Who the hell is that?
Thats from us.
Daddy, I think its time.
Whats the rush?
Thank you for coming.
God, she is all kindsof trouble, isnt she?
Everything turnsyou on, doesnt it?
Is your mother still alive?
- Did I miss anything?- Youre just in time.
How many funeralshave you been to today?
- Excuse me?- He wants to know where you got the drink.
Give my regards to Megan.
Rumor has it theyre gonnamove her to four days a week.
Legend has it.
So, is she alive?
Yes, she is.
Don, what about your mother?
Still with us?
Im gonna watchfrom over there.
If I could get your attention.
Id like to thankeveryone for coming.
I apologizefor the dry atmosphere,
but as Ive been remindedmany times today,
Mother did not approveof libations.
Excuse me, but I havea few words to say.
I insist.
Of course. Why dontyou roll on over here?
Can everyone forgetwhat Ive said so far
so that Mrs. Hazel Tinsley,who graciously flew up
from Palm Beach, can havethe honor of going first?
Stay here.
I want to saysomething, if I may,
at this informal moment
because I do not believein speaking graveside.
This is where she livedand this is where she died.
"This woman spent 90 yearson the Earth,
of noble birthand of some advantage,
devoting herself to one man,but loving another.
That man was Roger."Thats you.
"When Roger Sterling Sr.sbrief time was over,
it was this Rogerwho filled her days.
One could not talk to her withouthearing about his achievements,
his wit, his kindness.
We all said, Mimsy.
Mims, you should find another man.Life is long.
She said, I dont need anyone.
My heart is full becausemy son is my sunshine."
Get him out of here.
Sorry.Im sorry.
Where were you?
Im sorry, but isthat man all right?
- Whats he doing here?- What?
- You heard me.- Can we get someone in here to clean up?
- Let Bruce Pike clean it up.- Roger.
I just wantedto pay my respects.
I think it would havebeen more respectful
of you not to come.She didnt like you either.
I dont thinkI ever met your mother.
She wouldnt if she had. Thisis supposed to be just family.
- See how upset everybody is?- Roger, stop. Stop it this minute.
- You shouldnt have brought him.- Daddy, please.
This is my funeral!
You know what?Partys over.
Everybody out.
Thank you very much.Out!
Thank you.
Pardon me.Im looking for someone.
Could you help me?
Everybodys gone.
Not everybody, obviously.
I think they were overwhelmedby that touching tribute.
What do you want?
That man never tiresof embarrassing himself.
Youre the one who brought him.
Im talking about Don.
Oh. He was just saying whateverybody else was thinking.
You shouldnt have brought him.
Youre right.
Now you have one on me.Do you feel better?
My mothers dead.
I know, Roger.
Must be very hard for you.
I dont feel anything.
You certainly seem emotional.
Because I need a drink.
She lived a long time.
And she knewthat you loved her.
So maybe theres nothingto drink about.
I feel like she always wanted tospend time with me and I never did.
That may be somethingto consider.
You have a family.
Are you kidding me?I looked out at that crowd
and all I saw was a bunchmore women Ive disappointed.
Roger Sterling,no matter what you do,
everyone loves you.
What youre seeing is them worriedabout how you feel about them.
So, you miss me?
I know your daughter does.
Dont you wonder what Margaretwill say at your funeral?
You had to bring that up.
I did.
You should spendmore time with her.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Remember the last timethis bed was covered in furs?
We rolled around all over them.
- What are you doing?- I dont know.
You look great.
It would be soothing.
Soothe yourself.
Im gonna clean up.
Jonesy.
Mr. Draper,are you all right?
- Hes not feeling well.- Hey, Jonesy.
Jonesy, what did you see?
I didnt seenothing, Mr. Draper.
No, no, when you died,what did you see?
- Don, lets get you upstairs.- Wait, I want to know.
I want to know.
What did you see when you died?
I dont know. Doc saidI wasnt really dead.
I saw it. You were dead.He died right there.
What did you see?
I dont like to think about it.
- You must have seen something.- I guess there was a light.
Was it like hot,tropical sunshine?
- I dont know.- Did you hear the ocean?
Mr. Draper,you should go upstairs.
- Is he all right?- Hell be fine.
- Excuse me.- Yeah?
- Is that St. Marks Place?- Yup.
Im sorry, Im lookingfor someone.
A girl.
- Which one?- This one.
Theres lots of chicks thatcome in and out of here.
Ive been in the buildings across the street.Are you sure you havent seen her?
Look, lady, its cold as a witchs tit.Were going inside.
May I?
Doors always open, man.
Hey, I got the pork butt
and I lifted a bunch of onions.
Sandy?
Sandy?
Oh, Im sorry.Excuse me.
Im sorry to bother you again,
but this violin,this belongs to the girl
I was talking about. Are yousure you havent seen her?
Look, lady, I dont want to haveto lay the regular rap on you,
but I am exhaustedfrom telling people like you
- I havent seen people like her.- But she was here.
I havent seen your daughter.


Shes not my daughter.
So, what are you,some kind of social worker?
Her violin teacher?
Shit.Whats her name?
Sandy.
Hey, anybody seen Sandy?
Do you know howto make goulash?
Cause Ive got pork butt,two onions, and lentils
which I think is whats in it.
Hey, Moon, turn around.
And paprika.I know thats in it.
Well, for one thing,youll need a pot.
We got a pot.
Youll have to wash it out.
Theres no water.
Really?
We used to use the hoseat the Episcopal church,
but now the pipes are frozen.
It was great here all summer.It was hot.
So much rather be hotthan cold.
Ill go on the roofand get a chunk of snow.
- Oh, youll get sick.- We do it all the time.
My mom makes great goulash.
- Where are you from?- Everywhere.
Hold on.
I think theresan army kn*fe by the bed.
Hello?
Your mother still here?
No. She left.
Im just waiting for themto wrap up the deli.
Wheres Skeezix?
Brooks took him bike riding.
Its kind of cold out there.
He cant tell the difference.
The other dayhe walked in singing
and I lookedand his nose was bleeding.
He didnt know how he did it.
So hes tough.
Listen, I want youto have something.
This was your grandmothers.
My dad brought it back for her.
He went everywhere.
- What is it?- Its water from the River Jordan.
I was baptized with it.So were you.
We would have used it on Ellery,but I guess she forgot.
Hope she didntput her teeth in it.
Well, thank you.Its lovely.
Did Nana Mimsyleave me anything else?
Im afraid she lefteverything to the zoo.
Shes making themname the animals.
Im sorry.
That doesnt seem funny to me.
It does to me.
Her will looked likethe manifest from Noahs ark.
Well, its different for you.
Brooks didnt startoff where you did.
- Hell get there.- Oh, I know he will.
Its justthat theres--
well, Daddy, theresthis opportunity.
I dont know, I--
I told Nana about it,
but obviouslyshe didnt understand.
Were you this specific?
Daddy, dont.
Its not good for you.
I worry.
Refrigeration.
Its the waveof the future, Daddy.
They can transport fruitall the way from California
in just four daysand it doesnt go bad.
Some of these truckscan carry 20 tons.
And, of course, yourebuying the technology
for the refrigerated trucks, so itdoesnt matter what they get used for.
Its really notBrooks problem.
Well, I guess you should haveBrooks talk to me about it.
Of course.
I know hed like tomake it on his own, but--
Id have to seesomething on paper.
Oh, hes got that, believe me.
Well, good.
And Im gladwe had this little chat.
Oh, Daddy.
Im going to go see iftheyre done in the kitchen.
Don?
Don?
Did you make itto the memorial?
Except for the mess, youreexactly where I left you.
I put in an appearance.I just should have had lunch.
Aspirin?
Im better now.You?
Well, I pushed Dereksmother down the stairs.
- Did you?- I did.
They wanted me to radiate evil,so I looked her in the eyes,
but I dont knowhow close the camera was
because it wasa stuntman in a dress.
Dont worry. I dont think theresa nice way you can do that.
Im not sure people will wantmy autograph anymore.
Yes, they will.
So youll still love me
even if Im a lying,cheating whore?
But Im gonna walkbehind you on the stairs.
Okay. Well, Im gonnamake you dinner.
Oh, Rosa found thisin the garbage.
I think she was afraidyoud think she was stealing.
Sleep.Ill come get you.
Hey, Danny, wheredyou take that joint?
Theres three f*cking rooms.Where do you think I am?
No, thank you.
Is marijuana expensive?
Do I have to stir it again?
- Is it boiling?- No.
- My coat smells like onions.Yoo-hoo.
You better tell him you did the cooking, man.Its your job.
Its my bag.
- It smells good.- I made goulash.
- Did you get Wonder Bread?- We got batteries.
Hey, Zal, did you makeany friends today?
Did you run into this chick?Whats her name?
Im sorry.This violin belongs
to my friend Sandy. Do youknow when shell be back?
Sorry, Blondie, but thatviolin belongs to me.
No, I know the girl who plays thisviolin and Im looking for her.
Yeah, no, I saw her.She sold it to me.
Shes trying to get enoughbread to go to California.
Says its too cold.
So where is she now?
- Does she owe you money?- No.
Well, your daughters long gone,Blondie, so why dont you run along?
- Come on, Zal.- Why are you being so rude?
Why cant you leave her be?k*ll you to be out of control.
Well, someone needsto control this mess.
Lady, we have to take everythingthe Establishment throws away.
Thats all thats left.
What you cant grokis that we are your garbage.
You dont want this house,you dont want us.
Youre not allowedto ask anybody to leave.
The bylaws sayif someone is a nuisance
or a narc,that shall not be observed.
Im obviously notthe people youre talking about.
I came here because Im lookingfor someone that I do want.
I did not throw her away.
Yeah, youre a goodie.I can tell.
Look at this.Shes got 80 bucks.
- Can I have it?- No. Thats all they care about.
Well, Miss ElizabethHofstadt Francis
of Rye, New York,
eyes blue, hair bottled,
we dont like your lifeany more than you do.
You have bad manners.
You deserve to live inthe street of this pigsty,
and I hope you get tetanus or crabs orwhatever else is crawling around here.
Hey, thats my violin.
She sold it?I dont believe you.
You want it? Ill giveit to you for 10.
What are you goingto do with a violin?
Gonna learn how to play it.
Because its so easy.
Theres a meatball, whichis probably cold by now,
and an Italian, which isprobably even colder.
Youre typing a lot.You got a new way to go?
No, Im doing this thingDon used to do.
Im writing a letterto a fictitious acquaintance
telling her how greatmy new headphones are.
Well, I hate thatit gives you extra work,
but I think its about time
this unjust w*r is finallyhaving an impact on commerce.
Meatball.
- Did we order dinner?- No.
I can share.
Try the headphones again.Try and think of some words.
- What have you got?- We have three very different angles.
If you dip the audioin the wide sh*t,
Mark Antony is just, you know,
mouthing the "lend meyour ears" part.
You hear the announcer sayone of these things--
One. "Are you ready forthe sound for the ages?"
Two. "Koss knows thatgood sound is timeless."
Or "Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not yourold-fashioned sound."
Whats the next one?
- The next one or the second one?- You said you had three.
Those were three.Didnt I read all of them?
Those are three differentversions of the same idea.
If you cant tell the differencebetween which parts the idea
and which parts the execution ofthe idea, youre of no use to me.
I know what youre doing.Ive been you.
Youre hoping thissparks my imagination
and then you can say,"Wow, shes a genius,"
or say anything becauseyou want to go home.
I think theyre verydifferent from each other.
Well, Im sorryto point it out,
but youre walkingover the same ground.
When you bring me something likethis, it looks like cowardice.
Here, you can split thiscause youre not going home.
What do you think?
What?
- How do they sound?- Scared. You were a little rough.
No, the headphones.Dont worry about them.
Some workersdont respond to that.
Look, Abe, I dont needanother negative voice.
And those, quote, "workers" arentsurprised that Im frustrated
because they knowthat theyre lazy.
Sorry. I didnt knowwhat kind of abuse
was requiredto get into the frat.
Listen to your music, kid.
Because you laughed at him.
Yes, they like that.
Hello.
Where you been?
I had some errands to run.
Well, I know what somebodysgetting next Christmas.
Did you eat?
Chicken salad.
Thats a relief,because my feet are frozen.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.
Morning.How are we today?
- Fine, thank you.- Youre welcome.
Seeing as how youwere under the weather,
I just wanted to remind you aboutJules and Terry from Sheraton later.
Cancel.
Their bosses are comingback next week
and they just sent youon a very expensive trip.
Would you get Stan in here?
Oh, listen.
I got this by mistake.It belongs to some private.
See if you can find out someway to get it to his division.
I will. Do you wantto enclose a note?
Nah. I found iton a barstool.
I mean, youve got to beon my side here, right?
First my ex-wife works the bodywith a brutal guilt attack
and then my daughter worksthe wallet like a speed bag.
You want me on your side?
- You have kids?- Were not talking about me.
You know, I usedto jump off mountains.
It never occurred to meI had this invisible parachute.
My mother loved me in somecompletely pointless way
and its gone.So there it is.
She gave me my lastnew experience.
And now I know thatall Im going to be doing
from here onis losing everything.
You feel loss.
Damn it, how many timesdo I have to say this?
I dont feel anything.
Im just acknowledgingthat life,
unlike this analysis,will eventually end
and somebody elsewill get the bill.
- Good morning, Ken.- Good morning, Bob.
What are you doing out here?
You have a meetingwith someone important?
No, but are you looking for me?
Ill drop everything. I just cameout here to enjoy the light.
Oh, I thought maybeyou were out here
greeting customersfor your catering business.
- What are you talking about?- You know exactly.
Im sorry,are you cross with me?
Someone sent a royal spreadto Sterlings.
It had a card on itwith your name.
Oh, that. It justseemed the thing to do.
Well, it was too much.
It was almost like you wereinvited, but you werent.
I guess I was just rememberingwhen my father died.
Any gesturemeant something to me.
There wasnt supposedto be a card.
Okay.
Well, take your workand go back to your office.
Sitting out here makes peoplethink you have nothing to do,
and I suspect yourehoping its the opposite.
I guess its time to catch upon my phone calls.
Look, were sorry we had to squeezein this meeting between the holidays.
Were obviously not expectinga full presentation.
Well, I can saywith all honesty that Don
has not stopped talking aboutyour incredible property.
I never stayed at the Royal, butI shipped out of Pearl in 1943
and, Ive got to say, I canstill smell the gardenias.
Thank you for that.Don?
So, Bob Grange and hisdelightful wife Patty
saw to our every needand also missed no opportunity
to expose usto the unique local flavor.
Lucky Bob.I tried to get that job,
but unfortunatelyI got promoted.
Well, Ive just come back
and Im not sure how muchIve talked about it,
but there is a feelingthats stayed with me.
Ive been in the winter.
Its quite a shock coming back.
Well put. But thatcould be any vacation.
This was very, very different.
I think were not sellinga geographical location.
Were selling an experience.
Its not justa different place,
you are different.
And youd think thered bean unsettling feeling
about something so drasticallydifferent, but theres something else.
You dont miss anything.Youre not homesick.
It puts you in this state.
The air and the water
are all the sametemperature as your body.
Its sensory--the music, the fragrance,
the breeze, and the blue.Stan.
Ahem.
Its just a sketch.
Hawaiian legendhas it that the soul
can go in and out of the body,
but that it usually leaves froma leeward point into the waves.
"Hawaii.The jumping off point."
So what happened to him?
He got off the plane,took a deep breath,
shed his skin, and jumped off.
I assume this is a photograph.
More color.That water is transparent.
Well, I suppose it remindsme a little of the cinema.
But mostly I see James Mason
- at the end of that movie walkinginto the sea. - What is that movie?
Im not sure I knowwhat youre taking about.
Hes k*ll himself.I dont think they show it,
but hes going to swim outuntil he cant swim back.
That may be a personalassociation for you,
but thats not what this means.
We looked at this. Noneof us thought of that.
"A Star is Born."
The copy is all aboutthe Hawaiian legend.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
Im sorry, but thisis very poetic.
- Thank you.- Wheres our hotel?
Wheres the Pink Palaceand Diamond Head?
You got to haveDiamond Head in the sh*t.
Anyone can do that.
I dont agree.
Well, theres no reason we canttilt the camera up 45 degrees
and see the husk of ourcity dweller on the sand
and an arm of the hotel andDiamond Head in the background.
So there would be a manin this photo
and he most likelywould be naked?
Actually, my first thoughtis there is no man.
Just his footprints.What happened to him?
I think, and I thinkpeople might think,
that he died.
Maybe he didand he went to heaven.
Maybe thats whatthis feels like.
- Its a little morbid.- Well, heavens a little morbid.
How do you get to heaven?Something terrible has to happen.
We dont want that in the ad.
Of course theresno doubt this concept itself
is merely a jumpingoff the point.
A picture of a hotel,even yours,
is easy to ignore.
This, or some version of this,demands your attention.
Well, you will continueto have our attention.
Make no mistake, were notafraid of provocative.
So is there any time left forholiday plans for either of you?
- Happy New Year, everyone.- You as well.
Whats the matter? You didntget all your vomiting done
at my mothers funeral?
Roger, I apologize.I had a bug.
Yeah, well, you didntmiss anything.
Does that make youthink of su1c1de?
Of course.
Thats whats so greatabout it.
You know, we sold actual death
for 25 years with Lucky Strike.
You know how we did it?We ignored it.
Hold on.
Can I go to Beckysfor New Years Eve?
- Talk to your mother.- Cant you get a sitter?
Have your friend come here. You canbang pots and pans at midnight.
Its a party. They cantbring the whole party here.
Ill stay until 9:00.Ill put them to bed.
Hello.
Ask your mother.Were in here.
So?
Anything new?
I hate it.Youre ugly.
What happened to you?
So?
Elizabeth Taylor,
what have you donewith my wife?
Youre free until lunch, but Ihave to tell you something.
Just a minute.Whats that?
More bad news.Giorgio died.
His family sent overhis shoeshine kit
because you were the onlyone who called about him.
What happened to him?
I didnt ask.
So the secret is to rub thepot with a clove of garlic
and then add twicethe kirschwasser.
How wonderful that we canjust stagger downstairs.
I might just get undressedin the elevator.
I dont know if I canmake it to midnight,
but I do know were not leavinghere until those kids are in bed.
Its a beautiful fondue pot.
- Whered you get it?- Bloomingdales.
The kitchen store. They haveeverything you could think of.
Not everything.Tell the story.
Well, theres a guyin my office.
Hes very flamboyantand he got arrested there.
- Shoplifting?- No.
But he was caughtred-handed.
Apparently the mens room
is a locale for a certainkind of assignation
and the store detectives always goingin there and looking under the stall.
So, my regional sales manager
apparently takestwo shopping bags,
puts his feet in them
while the love of hislife sat on the john.
That is clever.
How the hell did he get caught?
How old are your children?
Um, 11 and seven.
Well, I might gokiss them good night.
Ours is a freshman at Michigan.
- He didnt even come home.- Oh, Im not ready for that.
The house feels empty.
Then you get a phone bill.
Well, if everybodyshad enough cheese,
Im gonna switch to chocolate.
But first, because it lookslike its snowing,
I think its timewe all took a trip to Hawaii.
Were having such a good time.
Its all set up.
I want to go to Hawaii.
- Oh!- Ooh.
- Isnt it incredible?- Yeah.
Oh, let me explain.
I woke up in the morningand Don was at a wedding
giving away the bride.
Thats romantic.
How did that happen?
So, of course,Kreutzers yelling
and Ginsberg says, "Im sorry, butwhat the hell do I know about ham?"
How could they let him near clients?Havent they learned?
Hey, do you think Joan and Rogerare still sleeping together?
Because his mother croaked
and she completely ignored him.
I dont know. We dont even knowif that really ever happened.
Ive got pictures in my head.
Im gonna go grab some coffee.
- You want some?- Very funny.
Hey, Im not hanging up.
Happy New Year.
Ted. What are youdoing here?
I heard there were four peoplein the office on New Years Eve.
I figured I owed it to theteam to at least stop by.
Oh, Im just--
theres a--did you get my message?
I received them all.And I apologize,
but it was sort of aretreat for my wife and I
and, well, apparentlyI work too much.
Well, you know the problem.
Yes.Any solutions?
Theres one.
I found this thing.
- What is this?- Its an outtake.
He had his headset onand was clowning around.
Theres two minutes of it.
Look at this guy.What a pain in the ass.
I was irritatedabout it on the day,
but now Im a little excited.
I think you can show himmaking these faces,
with no music,and say something like,
"Koss Headphonessound so sharp and clear,
you can actually see it."
It always takes a crisisto sell work this good.
You think its good?
Makes me smilemore than the original.
- Do you want to see the new voice-over?- No.
Well, I hopeI didnt ruin your evening.
Not mine, but theres people workingout there, Peggy. Its New Years Eve.
If you knew you had something,you should have let them go.
- They know they can go.- No, they dont.
Oh.
Youre good in a crisis.
Thank you.
Happy New Year.
He likes you.
What did you hear?
All of it.
This is Galliano.
Its from Jonesy.
Im glad hes givingpresents to someone else.
I cant standthe constant bootlicking.
Hes grateful.
- Centanni.- What does that mean?
Its Italian for lchaim.
It means "100 years."
What do you thinkDave paid for their place?
Arnold, dont.
Fine.Don, what did you pay?
75.
Well, youre a floorhigher than us.
Jesus.Syl, did you hear that?
Happy New Year.
We missed midnight.Its 1:00.
We missed it.
Its probably my mother.
Or Dave and Cathy.
Face down in the hall.
Hello?
Um, Arnie, its the service.
Thank you.
Hello?
Okay.
