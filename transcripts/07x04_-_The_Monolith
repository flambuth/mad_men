( Theme music playing )
Well, now, we havethree options--
Catalina, which includes a boat rideone of us will enjoy,
Yosemite, which isa very long drive,
or Palm Springs, which--
are you listening to me?
Dont look.
Turn around.
That man is staring at me.
Well, Im relieved that you werentlooking for a better conversation.
Its a little rude, but Im fine.
- What were you saying?- Very well.
What are you doing?
George?
I didnt want to bother you.
Youre obviously hereon business.
What?
No.
Trudy and I are divorced--getting divorced.
Ive relocatedto our West Coast office.
George Payton, this is Bonnie,my real estate agent.
I wish you would stopintroducing me that way.
Why?Its good for business.
Okay, what if I say,
"Bonnie, my girlfriend,your real estate agent"?
- Nice to meet you.- Charmed.
What brings you to L.A.?Theres no cough-and-cold season.
- George works for Vicks.- Oh.
Actually, I left.Please, sit.
Im workingfor Burger Chef now.
You cant be inthe hamburger business
without taking a swingat Disneyland.
When did that happen?
Right after Toms heart attack.
I thought of you.
- Tom who?- Tom Vogel.
He had a heart attack?
Whos that?
My father-in-law.
I hadnt heard about that.
Hes fine.
Who knew he had a heart?
Yes, right.
You know were puttingMcCann in review.
Be nice for us to work togetherwithout old Tom in the way.
Hm.
It would k*ll him.
( Chuckles )
Do you want to join us?
How about I give you a callwhen I get back to the home office?
Of course.
Have a wonderful evening.
I love watching you work.
That was k*ll.
Those conversationshappen all the time.
Doesnt mean anything.
( Elevator bell dings )
( slow tapping )
( faint chatter)
Cutler: Accounts wont have to searchfor a conversation starter
and creative will benefitfrom accurate data.
Ahem, any questions?
Where are we supposed to work?
You all have offices.
Lloyd, from LeaseTech,has informed us
that the footprint of the machinewas prohibitive.
And then it occurred to us,
why not let every clientwho sets foot in that door
know that this agencyhas entered the future?
( Applause )
And please, we will tryand keep the construction
and installation processas brief as possible,
but steer clear of the areafor your own safety.
You might want to wear shoes.
Thank you all.
Dawn: If you have any personal itemsin the creative lounge,
please remove themimmediately.
Anything left behind at noon todaywill be assumed garbage.
Theyre driving us underground.
You know Lou didnt fightfor our space.
He doesnt believe in creativebecause he doesnt know how to do it.
Trust me, youre goingto use that computer
more than you use that lounge.
Did he hear me?
Why were you late?You know thats a no-no.
I wasnt late.I didnt get a memo.
I dont even know whats going on.
Well, were getting a computer.
Its going to dolots of magical things,
like make Harry Craneseem important.
This decision must have been madeat the partners level.
It preceded you.
You got a problem,take it up with Cutler.
Think its too earlyto come in and celebrate
our technological advancement?
I think thats worsethan being late, isnt it?
Youre right.Good thinking.
Maybe later, off campus.
Harry Crane took a huge dump,and we got flushed down the toilet.
Ginsberg, dont you believein advertising?
That computer is the "Mona Lisa."
People pay entryto the whole Louvre
just to walk by that thing.
This is what was uniqueabout this place.
I want the couch.
That is not going to fitin our office.
Why dont we switch itwith the one in Lanes office?
Because that ones really good.
You mean Dons office?
Don! Will you takethe other end of this?
Okay.
You gotta hold your sidea little lower.
Im on the heavy sideof the seesaw right now.
A little to your right.
My right.
Damn it, Ginsberg.Put it back.
Its too big for our office.
Come on, Stan!I wanna try!
The other ones full of farts.
Youre on your own.
Ginsberg: Let me put this in termsthe art department can understand--
theyre trying to erase us!
But they cant erase this couch!
( Sighs )
So, in additionto the fruitful nature
of our previousrelationship at Vicks,
George is very excitedabout our bicoastal presence.
Are we concerned about a conflictwith H. Salt Fish & Chips?
- Pete: Ted?- H. Salt views themselves
as a specialty restaurant,not fast food.
( Chuckles )Thats a joke, right?
Pete, what did your friendat Burger Chef say?
Theyre going to opentheir thousandth store
and thats across 45 states.
George Payton knowswho his competition is
and he loves that we understandthe franchise game.
Well, Ted, youre the kingof fish and chips,
but I dont want you runningthe team from out there.
Were calling you home.
Sorry, Jim,Im not going anywhere.
I think we should put Peggy on it.
This is a national campaign.
Its almost three millionin billings.
The whole thingsabout the kitchen
and the cleanlinessand getting to the homemakers.
Theyll want a woman.
Lou?
I think Peggy is the right choice.
Well, Im glad we all agreethe client is going to love
having a womans point of view--or whatever Peggy counts as--
but is Don not even on the list?
I was thinking the same thing.
Hes spent three weeks alonein that cave,
and he hasnt clubbedanother ape yet.
High praise indeed.Lou?
Dons a very valuablepiece of talent.
He should be putto work already.
Absolutely.
Roger:Good work all around.
Thats what I always say,this business is about relationships.
Bye-bye, boys.
Ted:Dee, were done.
Lets see them give thatto Bob Benson.
We done here?
I thought we hadan understanding about Don.
Theres nothing to be afraid of.
Hes an exquisite copywriter,if nothing else.
Hes gonna implode.
Thats a distinct possibility,isnt it?
On the other hand,you might get some good work.
( Squealing )
( toy g*n popping )
Hey, spud.Get over here.
- Whats going on?- Were playing hide-and-go-seek.
You hear that, Caroline?Someones hunting big game.
And someones looking for you.
- Mommy here?- No, Daddy and Nana.
Theyre in there.
Ellery and I are supposedto go play.
See you later, alligator.
( pops )
Mona, Brooks.
What a pleasant surprise.
- Margarets run away.- To where? Bergdorfs?
Its not a joke.
Shes upstate with some sortof religious cult.
- What?- Its a commune.
You dont know that.
- What the hell happened?- I cant get a straight story.
Because I dont knowwhy you need to know.
Apparently, she woke upone morning
and got in a van with some hippiesthat she barely knew.
Shes only been gone a few days.
10. Brooks and I think it bestif you go up there and retrieve her.
The only reason I even told you
is because I need someoneto watch my son,
and I thought it bestit be family.
If you dont want to do it,
Ive got a long listof strangers I can pay.
Youre upset.
Youre not thinking right.
We cant help you if you donttell us what happened.
Look, she hasntbeen herself lately
and we went to this marriageencounter group.
( Chuckles )Youre kidding.
She wanted to, and I thought it wouldbe good for her to talk to people.
Thats always a mistake.
Roger!
Brooks, sweetheart,
I dont mind watchingmy grandson,
but it sounds likeyou tried to stop her
and you obviously failed.
- A father is a powerful thing.- What are you doing?
Of course, shell watch him.Let the man be a man.
I appreciate that, sir.Im gonna go say good-bye.
Im telling himthat Im joining her on vacation.
Good idea.
- ( Door closes )- What kind of a sales pitch was that?
- That was terrible.- I agree with him.
She is off her rockerand she has run away with,
from what I can glean,more than one lover.
I only know one other personwho would do something like that.
How is this my fault?
Because she is a perverse childwho only thinks of herself.
Look, I know youre upset.
I am terribly worried.
Itll be fine.
( Door closes )
- ( distant hammering )- ( drills whirring)
Harry:Well, it was a variety show,
and it featured this computerthat was programming the variety acts.
And they had a lotof psychedelic graphics.
It was obviousthat whoever did the sets
had never seenthe IBM 360, I can say.
Lloyd: Maybe Ill go buy a TV.I can catch it.
You should get a TV,but it got cancelled
11 minutes into the premiere.
Tim Conway plays a guy whos tryingto k*ll himself the whole show.
Probably to get outof his contract.
Don Draper,this is Lloyd Hawley.
- Lloyds with LeaseTech.- I saw you at the announcement.
And what do you doaround here, Don?
Oh, Don is, uh, a partnerand our creative director.
I thought Louwas the creative director.
- We have two.- We have three.
I mean, theres Ted, too.
You must havea hell of a business right now.
Well see.
Its tough, because we both sellIBMs product and compete with them.
Whos winning?Whos replacing more humans?
Listen, I apologizeabout your work area.
It wasnt my idea.
Look, Im sorry you lostyour lunchroom.
- Its not symbolic.- No, its quite literal.
Ill talk to you later, Lloyd.Some of us have work to do.
Thats why I supervisethe installations.
Theres always some kind of trouble.
Dont worry,that goes back years.
Well, I go into businesses every day,and its been my experience
these machines can be a metaphorfor whatevers on peoples minds.
Because theyre afraidof computers?
Yes. This machineis frightening to people,
but its made by people.
People arent frightening?
Its not that.
Its more of a cosmic disturbance.
This machine is intimidating
because it containsinfinite quantities of information,
and thats threatening,because human existence is finite.
But isnt it godlikethat weve mastered the infinite?
The IBM 360 can countmore stars in a day
than we can in a lifetime.
But what man laid on his backcounting stars
and thought about a number?
He probably thought aboutgoing to the moon.
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd.I should get back in there.
- You wanted to see me?- Close the door.
( Hammering fades )
Its quite a view, isnt it?
I like to think of myselfas a leader, Peggy,
and that meansdoling out discipline.
But it also means tempering itwith encouragement.
Which should I be prepared for?
I didnt hire you,but I would have,
and I wouldve paid youas befits your senior status.
Im giving you$100 more a week.
Im writing iton this piece of paper
because Ive found thatsaying things around here...
is useless.
Well, I...
appreciate that.
Very much.
Well, with it comes a mission.
Im putting you in chargeof Burger Chef.
Really?
Carve out hours for whomeveryou want on the team.
And Don.
- Don Draper?- Hes the one.
Thank you so much, Lou.
Knock em dead.
Have you told Don?
Youre in charge, sweetheart.
- ( Tools whirring, buzzing )- ( phones ringing )
- ls he in?- He never leaves.
Marsha, can you bring Donand Mathis to my office?
Certainly.
( Knocking on door)
Come in.
Please dont eat that.Youre so trim.
- Anything else?- Miss Olson would like to see you.
Send her in.
No, Im to send you in.
Okay.
- You wanted to see me?- Can I offer you something?
It was a long walk, but no.
I have what I thinkis very good news.
I hope youll see it that way.
Hey, Don.
I dont know if youveheard the rumors,
but Pete Campbell has gotten usa presentation with Burger Chef.
All I know is its national fast food.
- They run a new spot every month.- Thats right.
But we have to win it first,
and thats why I wantedyou both on my team.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to you.
Mathis:How long do we have?
I dont know yet, but I wantto get started right away.
I think 25 tagsshould get the ball rolling.
- Ill get right on it.- Apiece.
Thats 50 totalbetween the two of you.
- Whats the strategy?- Lou likes to start with the tags
and then sneak upon a strategy.
Youll get used to it.
Well, thatll do it.
- Thanks for thinking of me.- I look forward to your work.
Monday.
( Door closes )
( door slams )
( elevator bell dings )
- How was your weekend?- Lonely.
- How was yours?- Wouldnt you like to know?
Oh, Im sorry.
You have a meetingwith Miss Olson,
and the Burger Chefresearch came in.
- Is he in?- Yes.
Good.
Oh, good.
Dont act like youwere looking for me.
I was looking for you.
I need coffee.I didnt sleep last night.
Well, Mona called,
and Im supposedto read you this message.
"Hey, genius!Brooks is in jail in Kingston."
From now on,you dont listen to her,
you listen to me.
And what I really likeis no matter what you order,
they give you a side of spaghetti,
even if you order spaghetti.
What, Burger Chef does?
No, Vitos.
I can go get him.
Don:Come in.
Its time for the meeting.
I cant make it.
Oh.
Do you want meto turn in your tags?
Nope.
Okay.
Hes not coming.
- What?- Thats what he said.
Is that right?
I guess hes not ready.
I mean, we did just getthe research.
I would really appreciate a chanceto beef these up, as it were.
I mean, if Dons goingto get more time...
Heres a better idea.
Why dont we move the meetingto the end of the day,
and you give me what youve got nowplus 25 more?
Thats going to be 50.
But now you have the research.
( Bangs glove box)
- Hey.- Nothing works.
You need to calm down.
I dont want this turninginto "The Guiding Light"
the moment we get there.
Ha. Im worried,but youre angry.
Dont lose your temper.How much cash do you have?
Why dont you reach inand check?
His bail is 180.
Let Brooks spend another dayin the slammer.
- Hell just get in the way.- No, obviously.
I meant we should spring himon the way back.
Hes a bum.
If he wasnt a bum,she wouldnt have left him.
She told him she was neverleaving that place
and that he and Ellerycould stay there.
What was he supposed to do?
He was supposed to get into a fightwith those hippies,
not some rednecks in a barthree hours later.
Its my fault.
I always let her out of everything.
She only had one joband that was to find a husband,
and she mucked it up.
You liked him.
I thought he was good enoughfor the time being.
( Sighs )
I wanted her to wait like I did.
You only waitedbecause I wasnt available.
Well, look how that worked out.
What was she supposed to think?
"Things are hard.Ill just find another man."
That cant be it.
Oh, God, I hopeshes not a drug addict--
although they usuallystay in the city.
- How do you know that?- "Life" magazine.
Its probably another man,who probably has drugs.
You and me is notsuch a bad example.
I mean, what psychiatristis Ellery going to be telling one day
about the weekendhis dad was in jail
and his momwas on a commune?
Im sure you canrecommend one.
You know, I haventseen her in a while,
because the last time I did,she was so cruel and so serene.
She has been strange lately.
And a little bit philosophical?
Yes.
( Chuckles )
I thought she was finally happy.
( Knocks on door)
Come in.
Sorry to bother you.
Do you have a light?Mine crapped out on me.
The perils of technology.
Its 1969 and youre unableto make fire.
Human error.Forgot to fill it.
Youre the only one here.Its lunchtime.
Im not hungry.
Probably have too much to do.
Im not doing anything.
Look, I dont want to put you out,but if you have a second...
I have an advertising question.
Hmm.
Go ahead.
Advertising-- does it work?
On some people.
It helps to have a good product.
Ill tell you how great it is.
I started LeaseTechwith two old friends,
and six months later,we have 19 new employees
and three new competitors.
Well, the first question ishow is what youre selling unique?
IBMs leasesare short and expensive
because theyre always replacingthe equipment with the newest model.
Ours are cheaperbecause we dont do that.
Dont yours become obsolete?
They all becomeobsolete eventually.
The question is,how long does that take?
IBM doesnt care becausethey just sell new machines.
At this point, I usually ask,
"How did you getinto this business?"
Well, I was at IBM for a few years.
- I knew it.- Yes.
And I saw that they have gota great product,
but they dont trust it.
Now, Ive workedwith these machines.
I know how resilient they are.
I dont want to find themin a junkyard in two years.
So youre betting that theyll lastlonger than even IBM thinks?
Yeah.
But the problem is,so are a bunch of other companies.
But they dont have you,
and they dont advertise.
Very nice.
Whats IBM like?
Oh, there you are.I thought we were going to lunch.
Thanks for the light.Pleasure to talk to you.
You were going to give me the nameof a good keypunch service.
( Door closes )
- Whens Roger back from lunch?- Hes gone for the day.
- ( Knocks )- You got a second, Bert?
Of course.
LeaseTech--
the company were leasingthe computer from-- is a virgin.
And I think we shouldprepare a presentation
while their guy is hanging around,push him over the edge.
New business?


That whole industry is exploding.
This guy has exponential growth.
Have you forgottenthe stipulations?
Fine, tell somebody else.
I mean,the apple is right there.
You have a fundamentalmisunderstanding
of what went wrong here.
So, thats it?You want me to be a janitor?
Whistle while I work?
You thought there was going to bea big creative crisis
and wed pull you off the bench,
but in fact,weve been doing just fine.
So, why am I even here?I couldve gone anywhere.
- Why are you here?- Because I started this agency!
Along with a dead manwhose office you now inhabit.
I left something in there.
When?
Thank you, Caroline.I got it.
What are you doing?
( Chickens clucking )
Are you lookingto buy some jelly?
The stands up the road.
No, were lookingfor Margaret Sterling.
Hargrove.Margaret Hargrove.
I know who youre talking about.
Marigold!
She doesnt want any trouble,and we dont want any trouble.
Nor do we.
These two are looking for you.
You know em?
Of course I do.
This is my mother and father.
- Mother, you look wonderful.- Stop it.
I know why youre here,
and I just want to welcome you.
Margaret, darling, we just--
Could you call off your dogs?
Id like to havea private conversation.
Hey, everybody, I understandthe dry cleanings ready,
but can you bring it backin an hour?
Theres 50 bucks in it for you.
Im fine, everyone.These are my parents.
Will you let meshow you around at least,
before you start railing againstsomething you dont understand?
I dont know what happenedbetween you and Brooks,
but your son misses you.
Things have never been betterbetween me and Brooks.
Even
And...
I miss Ellery so much.
I think about him all the time,
but he cant be happyif Im not happy.
I didnt know how dire it was,but if you need money--
whatever you want,whatever you need.
She doesnt want money.Margaret, listen.
Sugarplum, these peopleare lost and on drugs,
and they have venereal diseases.
Thats not for you.
You dont know them.
And Im tired of acceptingsocietys definition of me.
I dont pray to that anymore.
Darling, I understand.
Being a young mothercan be overwhelming,
even with help.
You sit with your childat the end of the day
and youre exhaustedand you dont even know what you did.
And everything you doseems wrong.
Its hard to accept that thoseare the definitions, but they are.
Im sorry you hadnothing to live for.
I did.
I had you,and I was grateful.
Im grateful.
I dont have to lock myselfin a bathroom
with a pint of gin every day.
I ought to slap you.
Why are you talkingto your mother like that?
Daddy, Im sorry.
Im telling her the truth,and she doesnt want to hear it.
- Lets go!- ( Sighs )
You didnt even let me talk to her.
Theres no more point in talking.
Id think she was brainwashed,but theres nothing to wash.
You cant make her turn on a dime.Youll embarrass her.
Fine. You want to wine and dinethe account, Roger?
Knock yourself out.
Theres a four-year-old in Manhattancrying himself to sleep.
Ill get Cletusto drive me to the train.
( Door slams, engine starts )
Marigold!
You want to show me around?
- ( Sighs )- ( tools whirring, banging )
Hey, its Don.
Look at that, I got you.
I didnt know where youd be.
Youre here, there, everywhere.
No, Im not in the bag.Im in the office.
Listen, lets go to Shea.
Lets go see a game,I mean it.
Is there a game today?
You shouldnt have told me that,because now were really going.
Okay. Your wish is my command.I will not move.
Can I hang up the phone?
( Chuckles )
( groans )
When youre done with that,one of us should find some firewood.
When hes done with that,hes not going to be able
to find his ass with both hands.
Ill tell you what, Clay,why dont we switch jobs?
You want to get firewood,help yourself.
Theres no hierarchy, man.
Believe me,theres always a hierarchy.
We do thingsby true consensus here.
If we cant all agree on something,we think of something else.
Everyone does what they want.
Good.
Because I havent feltthis at one with nature
since I was in the Navy.
Go ahead.Its dynamite grass.
Now, I see whywere eating so early.
No, its because we followthe cycles of the Earth.
Its gonna get dark.
Electricity and all that?
It just brings problems.
But youve got a truck.
Yeah.
Thats been up for debate, man.
Doesnt it get cold up here?
We light a campfire.
And theres other waysto keep warm.
Its all right, sweetheart.Hes expecting me.
Freddy,what a pleasant surprise.
- You know you called me.- I sure do.
- Theres someone I want you to meet.- Who?
I want you to...♪ Meet the Mets ♪
Meet the Mets!
♪ Step right upand greet the Mets. ♪
Great idea.Can you walk?
Hello again.
Meredith, were off for the day.
- Way off.- Okay. You two have fun.
Where are you going?
( Tools buzzing )
Don, I didnt hear you.
No, I didnt hear you.
Come on, Don, were gonnamiss the game.
You talk like a friend,but youre not.
Im sorry, I dont understand.
I know your name.
Its Lloyd.I told you.
No, you go by many names.
I know who you are.
Don, lets go.
Why dont you listen to your friend?
You dont need a campaign.
Youve had the best campaignsince the dawn of time.
Pull yourself together.
Freddy?
Were knocking off early.
- Okay.- Ball game.
I just wanted to make sure you sawthe memo from the partners.
Your raise was approved.Congratulations.
What?
Oh, yes. Thank you.This office is so great.
Everyone can just drop byon their way out.
Dont worry,it wont happen again.
Joan!
Im sorry.Im just having a day.
I have exactly two minutes.
It wont take that long.
You already know the problem.
Burger Chefs a big account,
but they obviously thoughtyou were ready for it.
They didnt want to give meBurger Chef.
- They wanted to give me Don.- What are you talking about?
You didnt hear?
Lou put Don on my team.
- To cowardice.- Mine or theirs?
He owes me work,and hes going to the ball game?
And theres nothing I can do,and he knows that.
Have you told Lou?
You dont know this,but there were rules set for Don.
- Is he breaking them?- I dont know.
( Sighs )
So, they just dropped it in my lap,
hoping one of us would fail.
Well, Peggy, I dont knowif this makes you feel better,
but I dont think they thoughtabout it at all.
Roger: I cant believemy little "princess and the pea"
is sleeping like this.
Youve never even wantedto go camping.
Margaret:Well...
I used to thinkthe country was lonely.
Now I realize the city is.
I mean, look at that.
Its beautiful.
You think well puta man up there?
With all the brainpoweraround here?
Im certain youll puta man on the roof.
Id like to go to the moon.
Well, I guess if you can makean allowance for a truck,
you can make an allowancefor a rocket.
Dont you want to go?
Of course.
Every little boywants to be an astronaut.
Astronauts didnt existwhen you were a little boy.
Jules Verne--
"From the Earth to the Moon."
You read that to me.
They sh*t a cannon into space.
I dont think so.
Mustve been your mother.
Im really happy here, Daddy.
I know.
Oop, oop...
Get my binoculars.Theyre in the hallway closet.
Good idea.
Were going to missthe national anthem.
( Door closes )
( Margaret giggling )Stop it, not here.
( Car horn honks )
Come on.
Its as black and strongas Jack Johnson.
Thank you.
Howd you get in?
Im glad you passed out.I got a lot less to explain.
Did the Mets win?
What the hell are you doing?
Arent they giving youa second chance?
They werent serious about it.
They finally gave mesomething to do,
and it was write 25 tagsfor Peggy.
- Whats the account?- Burger Chef.
Hm-- Peggy.
Have you beento the restaurant yet?
What, and have some pimply kidwho should be writing taglines
hand me a milk shake?
How would you rather have it?
Would you rather bein my situation--
bouncing from office to office?
"Ding-dong,Don Draper calling."
I want my job back.
How the hell do you thinkthats going to happen
when youre at the bottomof a bottle?
You know you never have to haveanother drink again.
I dont want to hear that right now.
Youre hungover.Its the best time to hear it.
I mean, are you just goingto k*ll yourself?
Give them what they want?
Or go in your bedroom,get in uniform,
fix your bayonet,and hit the parade?
Do the work, Don.
- ( Birds Chirping)- ( Sighs)
Youre up early.
Wheres my daughter?
Shes probably at the creekgetting water.
I dont think so.
Its a beautiful nightand a beautiful morning.
Did you see the sunrise?
Its a beautiful morning, isnt it?
Its time to leave Shangri-La, baby.
Take a good look,say good-bye to your friends.
You were doing so well, Daddy.
Fine, you dont wantto say good-bye?
- Lets go.- Hey, man, leave her be.
Come on, Sprout, you feel likedriving the truck today?
No ones going to help youtake me away from here.
They know this iswhere I want to be.
I dont care what you wantand I dont care what they want.
Its over.Lets go.
I dont know why I assumedyou were more open-minded.
Well, Im not.
I understand the temptation,
and I know everyone your ageis running away
and screwing around,but you cant.
Youre a mother.
- Ellery has everything he needs.- He needs his mother.
Im sorry, but you dontget to do this!
Good-bye, Daddy.
Let me go!Let me go right now!
(grunts)
How could you just leave him?
Hes your baby.
How did you feel when you wentaway to work, Daddy?
Your conscience must have beeneating you alive.
Calling your secretaryfrom a hotel
to pick outa birthday present for me?
Im sure you were sick.
Its not that hard, Daddy.
Hell be fine.
( Elevator bell dings )
You sure you dontwant a Danish?
Nope.
- Coffee?- Yes, please.
Good morning.
Ill have your tags by lunch.
Great.
