( Theme music playing )
Well, now, we have three options--
Catalina, which includes a boat ride one of us will enjoy,
Yosemite, which is a very long drive,
or Palm Springs, which--
are you listening to me?
Don't look.
Turn around.
That man is staring at me.
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't looking for a better conversation.
It's a little rude, but I'm fine.
- What were you saying? - Very well.
What are you doing?
George?
I didn't want to bother you.
You're obviously here on business.
What?
No.
Trudy and I are divorced-- getting divorced.
I've relocated to our West Coast office.
George Payton, this is Bonnie, my real estate agent.
I wish you would stop introducing me that way.
Why? It's good for business.
Okay, what if I say,
"Bonnie, my girlfriend, your real estate agent"?
- Nice to meet you. - Charmed.
What brings you to L.A.? There's no cough-and-cold season.
- George works for Vicks. - Oh.
Actually, I left. Please, sit.
I'm working for Burger Chef now.
You can't be in the hamburger business
without taking a swing at Disneyland.
When did that happen?
Right after Tom's heart attack.
I thought of you.
- Tom who? - Tom Vogel.
He had a heart attack?
Who's that?
My father-in-law.
I hadn't heard about that.
He's fine.
Who knew he had a heart?
Yes, right.
You know we're putting McCann in review.
Be nice for us to work together without old Tom in the way.
Hm.
It would k*ll him.
( Chuckles )
Do you want to join us?
How about I give you a call when I get back to the home office?
Of course.
Have a wonderful evening.
I love watching you work.
That was k*ll.
Those conversations happen all the time.
Doesn't mean anything.
( Elevator bell dings )
( slow tapping )
( faint chatter)
Cutler: Accounts won't have to search for a conversation starter
and creative will benefit from accurate data.
Ahem, any questions?
Where are we supposed to work?
You all have offices.
Lloyd, from LeaseTech, has informed us
that the footprint of the machine was prohibitive.
And then it occurred to us,
why not let every client who sets foot in that door
know that this agency has entered the future?
( Applause )
And please, we will try and keep the construction
and installation process as brief as possible,
but steer clear of the area for your own safety.
You might want to wear shoes.
Thank you all.
Dawn: If you have any personal items in the creative lounge,
please remove them immediately.
Anything left behind at noon today will be assumed garbage.
They're driving us underground.
You know Lou didn't fight for our space.
He doesn't believe in creative because he doesn't know how to do it.
Trust me, you're going to use that computer
more than you use that lounge.
Did he hear me?
Why were you late? You know that's a no-no.
I wasn't late. I didn't get a memo.
I don't even know what's going on.
Well, we're getting a computer.
It's going to do lots of magical things,
like make Harry Crane seem important.
This decision must have been made at the partners' level.
It preceded you.
You got a problem, take it up with Cutler.
Think it's too early to come in and celebrate
our technological advancement?
I think that's worse than being late, isn't it?
You're right. Good thinking.
Maybe later, off campus.
Harry Crane took a huge dump, and we got flushed down the toilet.
Ginsberg, don't you believe in advertising?
That computer is the "Mona Lisa."
People pay entry to the whole Louvre
just to walk by that thing.
This is what was unique about this place.
I want the couch.
That is not going to fit in our office.
Why don't we switch it with the one in Lane's office?
Because that one's really good.
You mean Don's office?
Don! Will you take the other end of this?
Okay.
You gotta hold your side a little lower.
I'm on the heavy side of the seesaw right now.
A little to your right.
My right.
Damn it, Ginsberg. Put it back.
It's too big for our office.
Come on, Stan! I wanna try!
The other one's full of farts.
You're on your own.
Ginsberg: Let me put this in terms the art department can understand--
they're trying to erase us!
But they can't erase this couch!
( Sighs )
So, in addition to the fruitful nature
of our previous relationship at Vicks,
George is very excited about our bicoastal presence.
Are we concerned about a conflict with H. Salt Fish & Chips?
- Pete: Ted? - H. Salt views themselves
as a specialty restaurant, not fast food.
( Chuckles ) That's a joke, right?
Pete, what did your friend at Burger Chef say?
They're going to open their thousandth store
and that's across 45 states.
George Payton knows who his competition is
and he loves that we understand the franchise game.
Well, Ted, you're the king of fish and chips,
but I don't want you running the team from out there.
We're calling you home.
Sorry, Jim, I'm not going anywhere.
I think we should put Peggy on it.
This is a national campaign.
It's almost three million in billings.
The whole thing's about the kitchen
and the cleanliness and getting to the homemakers.
They'll want a woman.
Lou?
I think Peggy is the right choice.
Well, I'm glad we all agree the client is going to love
having a woman's point of view-- or whatever Peggy counts as--
but is Don not even on the list?
I was thinking the same thing.
He's spent three weeks alone in that cave,
and he hasn't clubbed another ape yet.
High praise indeed. Lou?
Don's a very valuable piece of talent.
He should be put to work already.
Absolutely.
Roger: Good work all around.
That's what I always say, this business is about relationships.
Bye-bye, boys.
Ted: Dee, we're done.
Let's see them give that to Bob Benson.
We done here?
I thought we had an understanding about Don.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
He's an exquisite copywriter, if nothing else.
He's gonna implode.
That's a distinct possibility, isn't it?
On the other hand, you might get some good work.
( Squealing )
( toy g*n popping )
Hey, spud. Get over here.
- What's going on? - We're playing hide-and-go-seek.
You hear that, Caroline? Someone's hunting big game.
And someone's looking for you.
- Mommy here? - No, Daddy and Nana.
They're in there.
Ellery and I are supposed to go play.
See you later, alligator.
( pops )
Mona, Brooks.
What a pleasant surprise.
- Margaret's run away. - To where? Bergdorf's?
It's not a joke.
She's upstate with some sort of religious cult.
- What? - It's a commune.
You don't know that.
- What the hell happened? - I can't get a straight story.
Because I don't know why you need to know.
Apparently, she woke up one morning
and got in a van with some hippies that she barely knew.
She's only been gone a few days.
10. Brooks and I think it best if you go up there and retrieve her.
The only reason I even told you
is because I need someone to watch my son,
and I thought it best it be family.
If you don't want to do it,
I've got a long list of strangers I can pay.
You're upset.
You're not thinking right.
We can't help you if you don't tell us what happened.
Look, she hasn't been herself lately
and we went to this marriage encounter group.
( Chuckles ) You're kidding.
She wanted to, and I thought it would be good for her to talk to people.
That's always a mistake.
Roger!
Brooks, sweetheart,
I don't mind watching my grandson,
but it sounds like you tried to stop her
and you obviously failed.
- A father is a powerful thing. - What are you doing?
Of course, she'll watch him. Let the man be a man.
I appreciate that, sir. I'm gonna go say good-bye.
I'm telling him that I'm joining her on vacation.
Good idea.
- ( Door closes ) - What kind of a sales pitch was that?
- That was terrible. - I agree with him.
She is off her rocker and she has run away with,
from what I can glean, more than one lover.
I only know one other person who would do something like that.
How is this my fault?
Because she is a perverse child who only thinks of herself.
Look, I know you're upset.
I am terribly worried.
It'll be fine.
( Door closes )
- ( distant hammering ) - ( drills whirring)
Harry: Well, it was a variety show,
and it featured this computer that was programming the variety acts.
And they had a lot of psychedelic graphics.
It was obvious that whoever did the sets
had never seen the IBM 360, I can say.
Lloyd: Maybe I'll go buy a TV. I can catch it.
You should get a TV, but it got cancelled
11 minutes into the premiere.
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying to k*ll himself the whole show.
Probably to get out of his contract.
Don Draper, this is Lloyd Hawley.
- Lloyd's with LeaseTech. - I saw you at the announcement.
And what do you do around here, Don?
Oh, Don is, uh, a partner and our creative director.
I thought Lou was the creative director.
- We have two. - We have three.
I mean, there's Ted, too.
You must have a hell of a business right now.
We'll see.
It's tough, because we both sell IBM's product and compete with them.
Who's winning? Who's replacing more humans?
Listen, I apologize about your work area.
It wasn't my idea.
Look, I'm sorry you lost your lunchroom.
- It's not symbolic. - No, it's quite literal.
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd. Some of us have work to do.
That's why I supervise the installations.
There's always some kind of trouble.
Don't worry, that goes back years.
Well, I go into businesses every day, and it's been my experience
these machines can be a metaphor for whatever's on people's minds.
Because they're afraid of computers?
Yes. This machine is frightening to people,
but it's made by people.
People aren't frightening?
It's not that.
It's more of a cosmic disturbance.
This machine is intimidating
because it contains infinite quantities of information,
and that's threatening, because human existence is finite.
But isn't it godlike that we've mastered the infinite?
The IBM 360 can count more stars in a day
than we can in a lifetime.
But what man laid on his back counting stars
and thought about a number?
He probably thought about going to the moon.
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd. I should get back in there.
- You wanted to see me? - Close the door.
( Hammering fades )
It's quite a view, isn't it?
I like to think of myself as a leader, Peggy,
and that means doling out discipline.
But it also means tempering it with encouragement.
Which should I be prepared for?
I didn't hire you, but I would have,
and I would've paid you as befits your senior status.
I'm giving you $100 more a week.
I'm writing it on this piece of paper
because I've found that saying things around here...
is useless.
Well, I...
appreciate that.
Very much.
Well, with it comes a mission.
I'm putting you in charge of Burger Chef.
Really?
Carve out hours for whomever you want on the team.
And Don.
- Don Draper? - He's the one.
Thank you so much, Lou.
Knock 'em dead.
Have you told Don?
You're in charge, sweetheart.
- ( Tools whirring, buzzing ) - ( phones ringing )
- ls he in? - He never leaves.
Marsha, can you bring Don and Mathis to my office?
Certainly.
( Knocking on door)
Come in.
Please don't eat that. You're so trim.
- Anything else? - Miss Olson would like to see you.
Send her in.
No, I'm to send you in.
Okay.
- You wanted to see me? - Can I offer you something?
It was a long walk, but no.
I have what I think is very good news.
I hope you'll see it that way.
Hey, Don.
I don't know if you've heard the rumors,
but Pete Campbell has gotten us a presentation with Burger Chef.
All I know is it's national fast food.
- They run a new spot every month. - That's right.
But we have to win it first,
and that's why I wanted you both on my team.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to you.
Mathis: How long do we have?
I don't know yet, but I want to get started right away.
I think 25 tags should get the ball rolling.
- I'll get right on it. - Apiece.
That's 50 total between the two of you.
- What's the strategy? - Lou likes to start with the tags
and then sneak up on a strategy.
You'll get used to it.
Well, that'll do it.
- Thanks for thinking of me. - I look forward to your work.
Monday.
( Door closes )
( door slams )
( elevator bell dings )
- How was your weekend? - Lonely.
- How was yours? - Wouldn't you like to know?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You have a meeting with Miss Olson,
and the Burger Chef research came in.
- Is he in? - Yes.
Good.
Oh, good.
Don't act like you were looking for me.
I was looking for you.
I need coffee. I didn't sleep last night.
Well, Mona called,
and I'm supposed to read you this message.
"Hey, genius! Brooks is in jail in Kingston."
From now on, you don't listen to her,
you listen to me.
And what I really like is no matter what you order,
they give you a side of spaghetti,
even if you order spaghetti.
What, Burger Chef does?
No, Vito's.
I can go get him.
Don: Come in.
It's time for the meeting.
I can't make it.
Oh.
Do you want me to turn in your tags?
Nope.
Okay.
He's not coming.
- What? - That's what he said.
Is that right?
I guess he's not ready.
I mean, we did just get the research.
I would really appreciate a chance to beef these up, as it were.
I mean, if Don's going to get more time...
Here's a better idea.
Why don't we move the meeting to the end of the day,
and you give me what you've got now plus 25 more?
That's going to be 50.
But now you have the research.
( Bangs glove box)
- Hey. - Nothing works.
You need to calm down.
I don't want this turning into "The Guiding Light"
the moment we get there.
Ha. I'm worried, but you're angry.
Don't lose your temper. How much cash do you have?
Why don't you reach in and check?
His bail is 180.
Let Brooks spend another day in the slammer.
- He'll just get in the way. - No, obviously.
I meant we should spring him on the way back.
He's a bum.
If he wasn't a bum, she wouldn't have left him.
She told him she was never leaving that place
and that he and Ellery could stay there.
What was he supposed to do?
He was supposed to get into a fight with those hippies,
not some rednecks in a bar three hours later.
It's my fault.
I always let her out of everything.
She only had one job and that was to find a husband,
and she mucked it up.
You liked him.
I thought he was good enough for the time being.
( Sighs )
I wanted her to wait like I did.
You only waited because I wasn't available.
Well, look how that worked out.
What was she supposed to think?
"Things are hard. I'll just find another man."
That can't be it.
Oh, God, I hope she's not a drug addict--
although they usually stay in the city.
- How do you know that? - "Life" magazine.
It's probably another man, who probably has drugs.
You and me is not such a bad example.
I mean, what psychiatrist is Ellery going to be telling one day
about the weekend his dad was in jail
and his mom was on a commune?
I'm sure you can recommend one.
You know, I haven't seen her in a while,
because the last time I did, she was so cruel and so serene.
She has been strange lately.
And a little bit philosophical?
Yes.
( Chuckles )
I thought she was finally happy.
( Knocks on door)
Come in.
Sorry to bother you.
Do you have a light? Mine crapped out on me.
The perils of technology.
It's 1969 and you're unable to make fire.
Human error. Forgot to fill it.
You're the only one here. It's lunchtime.
I'm not hungry.
Probably have too much to do.
I'm not doing anything.
Look, I don't want to put you out, but if you have a second...
I have an advertising question.
Hmm.
Go ahead.
Advertising-- does it work?
On some people.
It helps to have a good product.
I'll tell you how great it is.
I started LeaseTech with two old friends,
and six months later, we have 19 new employees
and three new competitors.
Well, the first question is how is what you're selling unique?
IBM's leases are short and expensive
because they're always replacing the equipment with the newest model.
Ours are cheaper because we don't do that.
Don't yours become obsolete?
They all become obsolete eventually.
The question is, how long does that take?
IBM doesn't care because they just sell new machines.
At this point, I usually ask,
"How did you get into this business?"
Well, I was at IBM for a few years.
- I knew it. - Yes.
And I saw that they have got a great product,
but they don't trust it.
Now, I've worked with these machines.
I know how resilient they are.
I don't want to find them in a junkyard in two years.
So you're betting that they'll last longer than even IBM thinks?
Yeah.
But the problem is, so are a bunch of other companies.
But they don't have you,
and they don't advertise.
Very nice.
What's IBM like?
Oh, there you are. I thought we were going to lunch.
Thanks for the light. Pleasure to talk to you.
You were going to give me the name of a good keypunch service.
( Door closes )
- When's Roger back from lunch? - He's gone for the day.
- ( Knocks ) - You got a second, Bert?
Of course.
LeaseTech--
the company we're leasing the computer from-- is a virgin.
And I think we should prepare a presentation
while their guy is hanging around, push him over the edge.
New business?


That whole industry is exploding.
This guy has exponential growth.
Have you forgotten the stipulations?
Fine, tell somebody else.
I mean, the apple is right there.
You have a fundamental misunderstanding
of what went wrong here.
So, that's it? You want me to be a janitor?
Whistle while I work?
You thought there was going to be a big creative crisis
and we'd pull you off the bench,
but in fact, we've been doing just fine.
So, why am I even here? I could've gone anywhere.
- Why are you here? - Because I started this agency!
Along with a dead man whose office you now inhabit.
I left something in there.
When?
Thank you, Caroline. I got it.
What are you doing?
( Chickens clucking )
Are you looking to buy some jelly?
The stand's up the road.
No, we're looking for Margaret Sterling.
Hargrove. Margaret Hargrove.
I know who you're talking about.
Marigold!
She doesn't want any trouble, and we don't want any trouble.
Nor do we.
These two are looking for you.
You know 'em?
Of course I do.
This is my mother and father.
- Mother, you look wonderful. - Stop it.
I know why you're here,
and I just want to welcome you.
Margaret, darling, we just--
Could you call off your dogs?
I'd like to have a private conversation.
Hey, everybody, I understand the dry cleaning's ready,
but can you bring it back in an hour?
There's 50 bucks in it for you.
I'm fine, everyone. These are my parents.
Will you let me show you around at least,
before you start railing against something you don't understand?
I don't know what happened between you and Brooks,
but your son misses you.
Things have never been better between me and Brooks.
Even
And...
I miss Ellery so much.
I think about him all the time,
but he can't be happy if I'm not happy.
I didn't know how dire it was, but if you need money--
whatever you want, whatever you need.
She doesn't want money. Margaret, listen.
Sugarplum, these people are lost and on drugs,
and they have venereal diseases.
That's not for you.
You don't know them.
And I'm tired of accepting society's definition of me.
I don't pray to that anymore.
Darling, I understand.
Being a young mother can be overwhelming,
even with help.
You sit with your child at the end of the day
and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.
And everything you do seems wrong.
It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.
I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.
I did.
I had you, and I was grateful.
I'm grateful.
I don't have to lock myself in a bathroom
with a pint of gin every day.
I ought to slap you.
Why are you talking to your mother like that?
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I'm telling her the truth, and she doesn't want to hear it.
- Let's go! - ( Sighs )
You didn't even let me talk to her.
There's no more point in talking.
I'd think she was brainwashed, but there's nothing to wash.
You can't make her turn on a dime. You'll embarrass her.
Fine. You want to wine and dine the account, Roger?
Knock yourself out.
There's a four-year-old in Manhattan crying himself to sleep.
I'll get Cletus to drive me to the train.
( Door slams, engine starts )
Marigold!
You want to show me around?
- ( Sighs ) - ( tools whirring, banging )
Hey, it's Don.
Look at that, I got you.
I didn't know where you'd be.
You're here, there, everywhere.
No, I'm not in the bag. I'm in the office.
Listen, let's go to Shea.
Let's go see a game, I mean it.
Is there a game today?
You shouldn't have told me that, because now we're really going.
Okay. Your wish is my command. I will not move.
Can I hang up the phone?
( Chuckles )
( groans )
When you're done with that, one of us should find some firewood.
When he's done with that, he's not going to be able
to find his ass with both hands.
I'll tell you what, Clay, why don't we switch jobs?
You want to get firewood, help yourself.
There's no hierarchy, man.
Believe me, there's always a hierarchy.
We do things by true consensus here.
If we can't all agree on something, we think of something else.
Everyone does what they want.
Good.
Because I haven't felt this at one with nature
since I was in the Navy.
Go ahead. It's dynamite grass.
Now, I see why we're eating so early.
No, it's because we follow the cycles of the Earth.
It's gonna get dark.
Electricity and all that?
It just brings problems.
But you've got a truck.
Yeah.
That's been up for debate, man.
Doesn't it get cold up here?
We light a campfire.
And there's other ways to keep warm.
It's all right, sweetheart. He's expecting me.
Freddy, what a pleasant surprise.
- You know you called me. - I sure do.
- There's someone I want you to meet. - Who?
I want you to... ♪ Meet the Mets ♪
Meet the Mets!
♪ Step right up and greet the Mets. ♪
Great idea. Can you walk?
Hello again.
Meredith, we're off for the day.
- Way off. - Okay. You two have fun.
Where are you going?
( Tools buzzing )
Don, I didn't hear you.
No, I didn't hear you.
Come on, Don, we're gonna miss the game.
You talk like a friend, but you're not.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I know your name.
It's Lloyd. I told you.
No, you go by many names.
I know who you are.
Don, let's go.
Why don't you listen to your friend?
You don't need a campaign.
You've had the best campaign since the dawn of time.
Pull yourself together.
Freddy?
We're knocking off early.
- Okay. - Ball game.
I just wanted to make sure you saw the memo from the partners.
Your raise was approved. Congratulations.
What?
Oh, yes. Thank you. This office is so great.
Everyone can just drop by on their way out.
Don't worry, it won't happen again.
Joan!
I'm sorry. I'm just having a day.
I have exactly two minutes.
It won't take that long.
You already know the problem.
Burger Chef's a big account,
but they obviously thought you were ready for it.
They didn't want to give me Burger Chef.
- They wanted to give me Don. - What are you talking about?
You didn't hear?
Lou put Don on my team.
- To cowardice. - Mine or theirs?
He owes me work, and he's going to the ball game?
And there's nothing I can do, and he knows that.
Have you told Lou?
You don't know this, but there were rules set for Don.
- Is he breaking them? - I don't know.
( Sighs )
So, they just dropped it in my lap,
hoping one of us would fail.
Well, Peggy, I don't know if this makes you feel better,
but I don't think they thought about it at all.
Roger: I can't believe my little "princess and the pea"
is sleeping like this.
You've never even wanted to go camping.
Margaret: Well...
I used to think the country was lonely.
Now I realize the city is.
I mean, look at that.
It's beautiful.
You think we'll put a man up there?
With all the brainpower around here?
I'm certain you'll put a man on the roof.
I'd like to go to the moon.
Well, I guess if you can make an allowance for a truck,
you can make an allowance for a rocket.
Don't you want to go?
Of course.
Every little boy wants to be an astronaut.
Astronauts didn't exist when you were a little boy.
Jules Verne--
"From the Earth to the Moon."
You read that to me.
They sh*t a cannon into space.
I don't think so.
Must've been your mother.
I'm really happy here, Daddy.
I know.
Oop, oop...
Get my binoculars. They're in the hallway closet.
Good idea.
We're going to miss the national anthem.
( Door closes )
( Margaret giggling ) Stop it, not here.
( Car horn honks )
Come on.
It's as black and strong as Jack Johnson.
Thank you.
How'd you get in?
I'm glad you passed out. I got a lot less to explain.
Did the Mets win?
What the hell are you doing?
Aren't they giving you a second chance?
They weren't serious about it.
They finally gave me something to do,
and it was write 25 tags for Peggy.
- What's the account? - Burger Chef.
Hm-- Peggy.
Have you been to the restaurant yet?
What, and have some pimply kid who should be writing taglines
hand me a milk shake?
How would you rather have it?
Would you rather be in my situation--
bouncing from office to office?
"Ding-dong, Don Draper calling."
I want my job back.
How the hell do you think that's going to happen
when you're at the bottom of a bottle?
You know you never have to have another drink again.
I don't want to hear that right now.
You're hungover. It's the best time to hear it.
I mean, are you just going to k*ll yourself?
Give them what they want?
Or go in your bedroom, get in uniform,
fix your bayonet, and hit the parade?
Do the work, Don.
- ( Birds Chirping) - ( Sighs)
You're up early.
Where's my daughter?
She's probably at the creek getting water.
I don't think so.
It's a beautiful night and a beautiful morning.
Did you see the sunrise?
It's a beautiful morning, isn't it?
It's time to leave Shangri-La, baby.
Take a good look, say good-bye to your friends.
You were doing so well, Daddy.
Fine, you don't want to say good-bye?
- Let's go. - Hey, man, leave her be.
Come on, Sprout, you feel like driving the truck today?
No one's going to help you take me away from here.
They know this is where I want to be.
I don't care what you want and I don't care what they want.
It's over. Let's go.
I don't know why I assumed you were more open-minded.
Well, I'm not.
I understand the temptation,
and I know everyone your age is running away
and screwing around, but you can't.
You're a mother.
- Ellery has everything he needs. - He needs his mother.
I'm sorry, but you don't get to do this!
Good-bye, Daddy.
Let me go! Let me go right now!
(grunts)
How could you just leave him?
He's your baby.
How did you feel when you went away to work, Daddy?
Your conscience must have been eating you alive.
Calling your secretary from a hotel
to pick out a birthday present for me?
I'm sure you were sick.
It's not that hard, Daddy.
He'll be fine.
( Elevator bell dings )
You sure you don't want a Danish?
Nope.
- Coffee? - Yes, please.
Good morning.
I'll have your tags by lunch.
Great.
