Sally, those go in your room!
And, Bobby,put your trucks in the toy box.
Im not your maid.
What do you think youre doing?
Nothing.
Get over here.
You could burn the house down.
Youre hurting me.
Good.
I cant believe you were smoking.
I wasnt.
Go upstairs.
Youre not going to bewatching television.
Youre not going to beplaying with your friends.
Im taking away Barbie.
- Youre mean.- You bet.
Get in there.
Im telling Daddy when he gets home.
Go ahead.
He left becauseyoure stupid and mean.
You want to sleep in there?
Why wont you let him come home?
Is that what you think?
His suitcase is here, and hes not.
Daddys on a trip.
I told you.
Its for business.
Can we call him on the phone?
Its long distance.
And I know hed be very upsetabout you doing what you just did.
Please dont tell.
Take your school books upstairs.
As soon as Carla gets here,
Im going riding,and I want a good report.
Who wants a Popsiclewhen its snowing?
Dont they sell enoughduring the summer?
Obviously not.
I love Popsicles.
I cant think in here!
Its a storage closet, not an office.
I called the meeting.
So where are the refreshments?
Why do moms give treats?
Theres no good reason.
My mom would come outto the truck with us.
Shed break the Popsicles in half,
then give it to uslike Jesus at the Last Supper.
Sounds cheap.
No. My mother did it, too.
It was great.
In Vermont, we made our own ice cream.
It was a pain in the ass.
Everyone breaks Popsicles in half.
So?
You can do it all year round.
Its a ritual. Its like Communion.
Its kind of Catholic, isnt it?
Its Christian...
as in behavior, not religion.
Let me tell you something.
The Catholic Churchknows how to sell things.
Any calls?
Mr. Peterson had some questionabout your expenses regarding...
Why doesnt he just die already?
Lut?ce.
Christ. Its IBM.
Myopic.
What else?
And you have an appointmentwith Spence-Chapin on Thursday.
Whos that?
Spence-Chapin, the adoption agency.
Im sorry. What?
Mrs. Campbell set it,
and, well, Im sorry,I have to say something.
Good luck.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
I think its one of the most blessed things
that a person would givea home to an abandoned child.
Shall I get Mrs. Campbell on the line?
Just get me Bert Peterson.
Well, hello there.
Hello, Bertram.
Is Florence with you?
No. Shes taking care of her mother.
Then we were thinking
about going to the Breakersthrough New Years.
Shes a good companion, isnt she?
Shes moody.
Damn it, Alice. I dont ask much of you...
My stockings cost morethan your carpeting.
Have you looked everything over?
Its a very generous offer.
I always say itsthe smartest thing I ever did,
helping you out.
22.50 per share per yearfor the next 10 years?
To think that Motherthought you were a failure.
She made me who I am.
Do you mind if I have a drink?
Sweet vermouth, please.
You can trust Cleveland.
You said on the telephoneyou were undecided.
Whats your hesitation?
I promised to take care of Roger.
Let Roger Sterlinghave what he always wanted...
to die in the arms of a 20-year-old.
The truth is you dont want to retire.
And I hate to say this, Bertram,
but you are old...
older than me.
I cant even imaginewhat that must be like.
Charming.
Please. Youre not well.
This is what I do.
Its a merger.You can continue to do it.
Ill be as usefulas the Queen of England.
Dont you want to go to Montana?
You ruined that poor architects life.
Go visit your cattle.
I do love them.
But you cant trust the Brits.
Ive left a letter on my bureau.
If Im not back in two days,the police will be here.
Why would you bring that up?
Because I dont want you to hurt me.
I just want to knowwhere my husband is.
Its a simple misunderstanding.
Theres a lot of men with my name.
Well, youre the only onewho used my husbands serial number
to get a drivers license.
Car title. Apartment lease.
Do you have a birth certificate?
In a safe deposit box.
Will you stop?
I saw the look on your face.
I dont know what to say.
Theres been a mistake.
Cant you be a human being?
Im his wife.
I dont care what he asked you to do.
I need to know.
I have to get back to work.
Stop lying.
Youve been caught.
Dont make me do somethingI dont want to do.
He died.
Im sorry.
What?
Im sorry.
Are you sure?
He never said he had a wife.
Seven years.
Im very, very sorry.
What happened?
He was k*ll in combat.
So, who are you?
They thought I was him and he was me.
I didnt think I was hurting anyone.
I cant believe it.
I just had to get out of there.
What are you going to do to me?
He never mentioned me?
I didnt know him long.
Maybe...
Whats your name?
Anna.
I dont know what to say.
Im making good money, if thats...
I know I owe you more than money.
I have his purple heart
and his dog tags, if you want them.
He wanted to marry my sister.
She looks just like me,with two good legs.
What is your name?
Dick Whitman.
Well, Dick, what do I do with you?
Well, this is a welcome surprise.
I can come back.
No. Come.
See this.
I guess all you needed was an audience.
Are you next?
I dont play.
Teddy, this is my friend Dick.
Hi.
Its called "In The Hallof the Mountain King."
Its scary.
I know.
Take a lollipop. Ill see you next week.
Bye, Mrs. Draper.
Youre tan.
Are you here on vacation?
No.
Business.
You look good.
Where are your things?
Or are you just here for the day?
I didnt even think about it.
I didnt mean to intrude. I can...
Are you in trouble?
No.
Well, then, what?
Can I take a shower and lie down?
Of course.
Trudy!
Youre late.
Spence-Chapin. How did that happen?
I put us on the list.
And, I dont know,we went right to the top.
Well, Im not going, and neither are you.
Peter, youre shouting.
Dont do that.
Listen to me very carefully.
We are not adopting a child.
Thats final.
Will you calm down, and we can talk...
Hells bells, Trudy! That is final!
You dont speak to me that way!
You have lost your mind!
Im glad youre not tired anymore.
I am, but my autopilots working.
What are you doing?
Youre tired. Let me do the driving.
Its okay.
Joanie.
Stop.
Honey.
You know what? I am tired.
Okay.
Is something wrong?
Whered you pick that up?
Greg, stop that.
You know there is no before.
Right.
Im sorry that I dont knowall the things you want.
But you do.
Im on call again on Wednesday.
These pants have a 38 inseam.
Harold.
I would like to meet him.
I kicked him out.
Even though old ladies shouldnt be picky.
Its beautiful here.
You like the porch?
You paid for it.
I think about you.
Just in passing, Ill wonder.
They were makinga commercial on the pier.
And then you called me.How about that?
Youve been in California too long.
How old are your children now?
Sally is 8.
Bobby is 5.
If you dont want to talkabout what happened,
thats fine.
But you can, you know.
I always felt that we metso that both of our lives could be better.
Thats just how it is between us.
I ruined everything.
My family, my wife,
my kids.
Im sure thats not true.
My brother came to find me.
I told him to go away.
I didnt know you had a brother.
Ive told you things Ive never told Betty.
Why does it have to be that way?
You love her.
You dont have to tell her everything.
Im sure there are thingsabout her you dont know.
Do you want to call?
No.
That would just confuse things.
So, what are you going to do?
I dont know.
I have been watching my life.
Its right there.
I keep scratching at it,trying to get into it.
I cant.
Im sorry.
Did you get the same thingin your stocking last night that I did?
What are you talking about?
Putnam, Powell & Lowe has offered
to put a lot of marmalade on your toast.
Sit, Roger.
Theres no rush. We have 72 hours.
Yes. Well,
I dont like being in the positionof having to sell off my lifes work
because you havean increase in overhead.
So Monas cryingon your shoulder now?
The late Mrs. Cooper introduced you.
Well, let her know it didnt work out.
Bert,
I know you dont thinkI got my hands dirty.
Im sorry I missed the Great Depression.
Still, I have served thisplace for the last 20 years.
Its a merger.
We can still come to work in our building,
in our offices,
only there will be diamondson the doorknobs.
So well have a meeting of the partners.
And for your information,Jane makes me very happy.
Thats good to know.
As Don illuminated,
advertising is essential for aerospace,
especially in reaching out to the public
to see that congressmen vote
for the spending billswhich bring new jobs.
Actual advertising, not public relations.
I have your father-in-law on line 1.
Tom. How are you?
Well, Peter, to be honest,
I dont like havingto make this phone call.
Why not?
Well, weve been thinkingabout things over here,
and were going to have toput Clearasil up for review.
Really? Thats a shock, Tom.
Now, why would you do that?
Sales have been spectacular.
All right, calm down.
I said review, not that were moving.
Youll have 90 days to turn it around.
Turn what around?
Youre distracted.
What are we talking about, Tom?
Look, son...
Every good businessman knows
that if his wifes unhappy,his work suffers.
Yes, they seem very directly relatedin this case.
Dont they, Tom?
Trudys happiness shouldbe your first priority.
I think you should pullClearasil right now.
I dont think youre goingto get what you want.
What about my daughter?
Shes my wife. Thats between us.
You know what?
I was in love with Trudy when I met her.
And then you stuck your nose in,
put these ideas in her mind,and made her unhappy.
What do you mean,you "were" in love with her?
Thats not what I meant,and you know it.
Yes. Perhaps it is bestif we just give notice.
Good-bye, Tom.
I bought you some clothes.
Tomorrow morning.
Theres something else.
What?
I met a girl.
Another one?
Shes so beautiful and happy.
Shes a model.
And shes from a good family,
and shes educated.
Whats her name?
Elizabeth. Betty.
I want you to meet her.
Look at you.
Youre in the lavender haze.
I just like the way she laughs
and the way she looks at me.
Yes.
You are very hard to look at.
I want to ask her to marry me.
Dick, thats wonderful.
Well, I need you to give me a divorce.
Well, of course.
I never thought of that.
You should hire a lawyer out here.
Ill pay for it.
And I want you to know that Imgoing to take care of you forever.
You dont have to do that.
I do.
You dont owe me anything.
This whole life.
If it wasnt for Don,
- if it wasnt...- Stop that.
So...
therell be another Mrs. Draper.
I guess so.
Youll have a family.
Thatll be good for you.
I want to.
This will probably beour last Christmas together.
Why?
You can be my cousin.
No.
This is a chance at a whole new life.
Thank you, Anna.
So, wheres Don?
Im sure you remember Peggy Olson.
Shell be walking you through this.
And when Don climbs outfrom under the weather...
Don has signed off on all of this.
When I was little,
my mother would take a twin pop
and break it in half
and give one to meand one to my sister.
We were completely equal in her eyes.
Beloved.
Everyone does this with Popsicles,
but they may notrealize what it means.
It has nothing to dowith an ice cream truck
on a hot summer day,
or the flavor,
or the color.
Its a ritual.
You take it, break it,share it, and love it.
People do do that.
This act of sharing,its what a Popsicle is.
Its the same treat from the freezeras it is from the truck.
I dont care if its snowing or hailing
or 100 degrees.
You can still take it, break it, share it,
and love it.
I like the wayshes handing out the pops.
The kids are excited, but...
the mom reminds me of something.
No, this is original.
Well, I can tell you this now,
but we wanted somethingwith the word "love" in it.
When asked, the first thingpeople say is,
"I love Popsicles."
Carson residence.
Sarah Beth, its Betty Draper.
Hello, Betty.
Im sorry.
Im at my wits end.
Sally... I think she mayneed private school.
How does Becky likeRockland Country Day?
Well, its a drive,but she seems more independent.
I havent seen you at the stables.
I saw it in the paper that Tara and Arthurare getting married next weekend.
Yes, I heard that.
I hope theyre very happy together.
Are you there?
Betty, Im sick about it.
Im sorry.
Thats why they call them crushes.
It was more than that.
Really?
Im telling you,I havent been able to sleep.
I keep thinking about him.
I think Raymond knows.
I cant even look at Becky.
What did you do?
Betty, I made a terrible mistake.
You did?
Dont act surprised.
He told me all the thingsyou said about me.
I was grateful.
Why would you do that?
What?
You wanted him, too. You know you did.
Theres a differencebetween wanting and having.
You did everything you couldto encourage me.
I didnt make you do anything.
My God, youre an awful woman,
you know that?
No one made you sleep with him!
Im going to tell you this,
and you can tell all your little friends.
This is a delicate piece of machinery.
You dont just shove paper in it.
You dont bang on the buttons.
You dont sit on the glass.
If you want it to work,
you have to treat it with respect.
What do you want?
I need to speak with you.
Honey, I have a 6:30 dinner reservation,
and unless you want to pullme there in a rickshaw,
I have to get going.
Well, Im a copywriter.
Why, did I call you something else?
No. I dont know if youre aware,
but I brought inthe Popsicle account today.
On my own.
Hey, Ginger, did you hear about this?
I gotta go. Wait.
I need my own office.
Its hard to do business and be crediblewhen Im sharing with a Xerox machine.
Freddie Rumsens officehas been vacant for some time.
I think I should have it.
Its yours.
Really?
You young women are very aggressive.
I didnt mean to be impolite.
No, its cute.
There are 30 men out therewho didnt have the balls to ask me.
There you are. Mr. Sterling, Miss Olson,
this is my fianc?, Dr. Greg Harris.


So youre the one who got our Joanie?
Yes, I am.
Youre a lucky man.
So nice to meet you. Congratulations.
And thank you again, Mr. Sterling.
Its a pleasure to meet you.
I have a dinner reservation,and I dont think Im going to make it.
Well, we do as well.
Were going to La C?te Basque.
I thought you hated French food.
Theres a new chef.
Good night, Ginger.Pleasure to meet you, Greg.
Let me get my purse.
Fix me a drink, will you?
I dont know.
Isnt that what these guys do all day?
Ive seen the movies.
Pretend like Im your boss.
Donald Draper.
Okay, one drink.
Dr. Harris, are you trying to examine me?
Maybe.
Not in here.
That Sterling guy knowsan awful lot about you.
Ive been working here for nine years.
Greg, dont. It isnt my office.
Its okay.
No, I mean it.
Come on.
Greg, this isnt fun.
This is what you want, right?
Stop.
Its okay.
Greg, no!
Are you ready to go?
I dont want to miss our reservation.
No, of course not.

His 12% makes him
mathematically insignificant.
Still, I would like to knowwhat he thinks, wouldnt you?
Hes very sawy.
Alice...
Im sorry, I dont knowwhose eyes to look at.
Where is Draper?
He took a business trip to California.

Do you think its odd?
I dont think about it at all.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Your fianc? is so handsome.
He is.
Hes the doctor you hope to seebut only exists in the movies.
Thank you.
Hes specializing in thoracic surgery.
Its very difficult.
And he volunteersat Harlem Hospital Center,
stitching up n*gro children.
Well, hes a keeper.
Whens the wedding again?
Look who I found protesting in the lobby.
Our man from the evening news.
Welcome back.
Look at you. Whats different?
Nothing. How was Mississippi?
I think we made a difference.
And it was the adventure of a lifetime.
Sheila dropped him three days into it.
Theres a Bankers Box in the corner.
What the hell is this?
My new office.
What?
Why dont you just put onDrapers pants while youre at it?
You have your own office? You?
Im the head of television,
and I spend the daystaring at an orangutan.
I have some unpacking to do.
Has anyone heard from Don?
Yes. He called.
He wants you to get back to work.
Id get a new couch if I were you!
Thank you!
Do you know who I talk to about this?
Ill have it taken care of.
Christmas.
Im getting married at Christmas.
Thats wonderful.
Hello?
Sally, can you come in here?
Im in the living room.
Hello, Mommy.
I want to talk to you.
Okay.
I realize I havent beencompletely fair to you.
And if there is something you want,Id love to give it to you.
Youre getting to be a big girl.
Someday youll want something,and I wont be able to give it to you.
Oh, Mommy,
theyre beautiful.
Thank you.
Youre welcome.
Can we go now?
Do you have homework?
Arithmetic,
but I can do it in the car.
Sally, now that youre a big girl,
Im going to tell you something.
Your father and I arehaving a disagreement,
and he went away.
Where did he go?
Im not sure.
When is he coming home?
I dont know.
I know its hard to understand.
But I promise,everythings going to be okay.
Okay.
Mommy, youre bleeding.
Go take those in the kitchenand have a snack.
Im going to change.
Thats an ink blot.
You see what you want to see.
You dont have to pick them.Just put your palm on the deck.
Did you read it?
I did.
Reminded me of New York.
And it made me worry about you.
What about the cards?
Should I be worried?
Its all here.
Youre definitely in a strange place.
But here is the sun.
That cant be good.
It is.
Its the end of the world.
Its the resurrection.
Do you want to knowwhat this means or not?
No, I dont.
I can smell the ocean.
This is the one.
Whos she?
Shes the soul of the world.
Shes in a very important spot here.
This is you,what you are bringing to the reading.
She says you are part of the world.
Air, water.
Every living thing is connected to you.
Its a nice thought.
It is.
What does it mean?
It means the only thing keeping youfrom being happy
is the belief that you are alone.
What if thats true?
Then you can change.
People dont change.
I think she stands for wisdom.
As you live, you learn things.
Come in.
Hello.
Look at you, celebrating.
You getting a secretary?
Yes.
Well, shes in for it.
You should get some pictures in here
of your familyor some people or something.
I want to put up my campaigns.
Isnt that Freddies bar?
He left it.
How the hell did you swing this?
Im sleeping with Don.
Its really working out.
I havent told anyone
because its probablya formality at this point,
but Clearasils pulled out.
How did that happen?
Sales have been great.
What about your father-in-law?
I guess Im not doing my job.
I know thats not true.
Donll dance on my grave,if he ever comes back.
Did something happen in Los Angeles?
Yes.
He disappeared.
He didnt even check out.
I almost called the police.
Well, why didnt you?Maybe something happened.
Well, it didnt surprise me.
I know some things about him.
Im not interested in gossip, Pete.
All Im saying ishe may not be coming back.
Hes done it before.
Whatever Don does or doesnt do,
I am sure its with good reason.
Guess I should probably go home.
Congratulations.
Good night.
