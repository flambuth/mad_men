(theme music playing)
("Cherry Brandy" playing.)
Oh, my God.You have to taste it.
Shouldnt we wait for Don?
Chateau Margaux 53.
Considered by somethe best there is.
So, you were talkingabout Ziploc.
Was I?
Yes. You were saying thatwe might be in the running.
No, I said I was still deciding.
I see. So you wouldlike to know why
the agency that hasover-performed on Handi-Wrap,
Oven Cleaner, Bathroom Cleaner,
and corporate image cleaner,is worthy of more business?
Well, I dont know aboutBathroom Cleaner.
"Germ k*ll"? It makespeople think of shit.
You didnt express that.
I expressed ambivalence
and you went the wrong way.
(chuckles)
Yes, of course. So would youlike us to redo the work?
As I said, Pete,I havent decided.
Please, Ken, dont get up.I apologize.
I couldnt get a cab.
I should let you tryKens incredible wine.
But first, I think you shouldknow that Ken prefers
the "bright and shiny"bathroom strategy
because he says "germ k*ll"makes people think of poop.
(laughs)
Dont have second thoughts, Ken.You picked the right strategy.
Okay.
Okay?
Should we order?
Woman on phone:Good evening, Mr. Draper.
You have three phone calls.
One at 7:00from Tricia Reynolds
and two from Diana Baurat 9:00 and 9:30.
Diana Baur?Whats the message?
Im sorry, what was the message?
Actually, I see here.
I wasnt supposed to giveyou her second message.
Or her first.
My goodness. Why dontthey just throw these out?
Do you know who spoke with her?
Yes, and Ill report this.I work with birdbrains.
No, its fine.I just...
Did she leave a number?
No. Im sorry.
(sighs)
Will you let everyone know Illpick up my own calls tonight?
Yes, of course.
And again, I apologize,Mr. Draper.
Good night.
Caroline!
Do you read the mailor do you just open it?
Shirley opened the mail.Ill get her.
No, go get whoever is responsiblefor paying our lease.
Dawn Chambers.
Joan!
Get in here!
Joan!
Dont do that.
Youre gonna have to fire Dawn.
She didnt pay the lease.
Ill take care of this.
(elevator bell dings)
- (intercom buzzes)- I have Trudy Campbell.
Well, hello, Trudy.How are you?
Frankly, not good at all.
What did I do?
No, its Tammy.
She was on the wait listat Greenwich Country Day
and they promised her admission,but they didnt keep their word.
What was she doing onthe wait list at all?
My fathers entire familywent to that school.
They know who are you, Peter.
And they know who I am.
And they knowthat were divorced.
Greenwich, Connecticut,is built on divorced money.
Dont yell at me.
Ive arranged for a meetingwith the headmaster
and Id like for youto accompany me to show
that were in this together,if nothing else.
Yes, of course.
Tomorrow.
Just once, Id like some notice.
I didnt wantto involve you at all.
(laughing)
You got me this time, Kirby.
Youre all fired.
Hold on.
Someone at McCann-Ericksongave notice in writing.
I was never informed.
We were never informed.
Well, its obviously a mistake.
Get Jim Hobart... no, FergDonnelly on the horn.
Just a minute.
Ladies, this is howrumors get started.
So this stays in this roomtill things get sorted out.
Back to work.
Ill get Ferg.
(organ playing)
So now I just want you to play.
Just pretend were not here.
(turns organ off)
Im giving youmy permission to play
with all these great toys.
Do what you would doif we werent watching.
Really?Thats what youd do?
Whats wrong with them?
You said you didnt want actors.
Well, real kids are shy.
And you have to talkto them like people.
They all have their own toy.
If we want enthusiasm,we should just have one toy.
Like a battle royale.
Just throw one in there and thelast kid standing gets the gig.
It would work.
You hate kids.
You know what? I want to seehow far you can throw that.
- (kids laughing)- Take it easy.
Rog, Im on my way to lunch.What can I do for you?
Itll just take a second.
Someone over there accidentallygave notice on our lease
and I need you to fix it.
Oh.
Well, actually...
Actually what?
You really needto talk to Jim about it.
About what? What thehell is going on, Ferg?
Roger, calm down.
I think youll seeits all good news.
Go ahead.
Well, were gonna moveyour whole office
into our buildingat the end of the month.
Why?
We dont mind paying people,
but it seems ridiculousto rent two floors
of the Time Life Building when wehave plenty of space over here.
Hold on, are welosing the office
or the agency?
Thats the wrong wayto look at it.
Were bringing you home.
This is my home.
Are you dissolving us?
Im gonna set a meetingwith Jim for tomorrow.
Look, this was supposed to be thelast thing done, not the first.
Were you planning thisall along?
Would you stop it?Its going to be great.
Roger.
What do I do?
(typewriter clacking)
Can I help you?
Really pulled one over on us.
Who?
What are you doing here?
Roger, you cant just tell Don.
- Tell Don what?- Do you need ice?
Were not to be disturbed.
- Go ahead.- No.
McCanns moving usto their building.
We lost our lease.
Everything must go.
So were moving?
Id love a new view.
No, Pete, I dont thinkthats all there is to it.
Were being swallowed up.
We have 30 days.
SC&P has conflicts.Thats why we exist.
Dont you understand?We dont exist.
Our rent is too high.
- Anybody else?- Yes, please.
Thats it?Have a drink?
Well, Im not going.
You want to give upthe rest of your money?
We all have four-yearcontracts and a noncompete.
I did not agree to this.
Yes, you did.
The minute we sold them thecompany, we all agreed to it.
After all that, Jim Cutler wins.
All that cash and no McCann.
I hate that guy.
I like it over there.
Because youre a sheep.
Knock it off.
Weve got a meetingwith Jim Hobart tomorrow
to discuss the details.Lets try and be dignified.
Keep it in this roomuntil we have orders.
That explainsthe forecast they wanted.
Im sorry.
They waited so long,I thought we were safe.
Betsy Wheeler.
Okay, Betsy,Im glad thats you.
Peggy, may I speak with you?
- Maybe later.- Its very important.
Ill be right back.
- (sighs)- Whats wrong?
Im telling you this because...
I dont know,because no one else will.
And you really need to know.
Were being absorbed by McCann.
(sighs)
Are they letting me go?
No, theyll need youfor a while.
Maybe forever.
All I know is havinga leg up on the rats
who fly off this shipis going to help you.
I would want it.
Oh.
Are you going?
I have to.
Ive never worked anywhere else.
Youll do great.
You should get back to work.
For your ears only.
Hello. Its me.
I love a call from youin the middle of the day.
I just wantedto hear your voice.
Even better.What do you want me to say?
I got some bad news at work.(sniffles)
Hey.
I dont care how bad it is.Its not that bad.
You dont know that.
We can talk about ittomorrow when Im there.
I didnt know you were coming.
Lisa, get me onthe redeye to New York.
Now you know.
(knocks on door)
Melanie called. She has two twobedrooms to show you tonight.
And its five minutes tillthe Mohawk status meeting.
Cancel everything.
Whats wrong?
Its personal, honey.
(phone ringing)
Don Drapers office.
Ill see if hes available.
Its Lou Avery callingfrom California.
(sighs) Shit.
I better take it.
Do you mind?
- Hello, Lou.- Don.
I think we needto have a conversation.
Look, we just found out.
I told Dee not to sayanything, but good you know.
Im moving next week.
When did they tell you?
A couple weeks ago.
I thought about it for 10seconds, then I thought,
"So what if its Tokyo?Its my lifelong dream."
They have an office in Tokyo?
They only have an officein Tokyo.
What are you talking about?
Tatsunoko Productions.
Theyre making "Scouts Honor"into a cartoon.
What did you thinkI was talking about?
It doesnt matter.
They made "Speed Racer," Don.
I got a $15,000 advance.
Obviously, my minds made up.
Obviously.
I wish I could seethe look on your face.
I bet youre not laughinganymore, are you?
No, Lou, Im not.
Well, sayonara, my friend.
Enjoy the restof your miserable life.
(laughs)
(sighs)
(exhales sharply)
Meredith.
If were trying to keepthe office calm,
closing those curtainsis a bad idea.
So spill it.Have you heard something?
Yes, I did.Lous moving to Tokyo.
Im not even going totell you why
because it wouldgive him pleasure.
The point is SterlingCooper West is empty.
Of course its empty. Its thefirst drop out of the teapot.
What Im saying isits available.
We can run a businessout of there.
We have no business.
I was looking atMcCanns rosters
and theres going to bea lot of clients
they cant hold on to...Conflicts.
Take Sunkist for example.
Its 10 million in billingsand growing.
Coca-Cola owns Minute Maid,so Sunkist is gone.
Burger Chef, its four million
and they just dumpedMcCann for us.
They keep telling metheir futures in California.
Exactly. Whats oursquare footage out there?
1,485.
An old girlfriend measured it.
What Im saying is theresbusiness in California.
If we can work outof a bassinet,
we can make McCann money thattheyd have to throw away.
"We"? I dont wantto go back to California.
Thats good. You dont have to.Stay here, theyd like that.
Anyone else want to stay here?
Are we really playing this game?
Dow Chemical.
McCann fired Ken. And I meanfired him out of a cannon.
He aint going near that place.
- How much is that?- Seven.
But Ken doesnt like us either.
But he loves feeling the tip ofyour nose in the seat of his pants.
Ill take care of Ken.
What about Avon?
Im sorry,but its not a conflict.
But I have the relationship.
No, that would bestealing a client.
Avon has to go to McCann andyou have to help them keep it.
Were going to hand deliverall of the clients they want.
Were meeting with Jim Hobarttomorrow and we cant cancel.
You think we can securethree accounts in 24 hours?
Weve done it before.
(door shuts)
Im sorry its so hot in here.
Im sorry about the intrusion,
but this is the only place wherewe know we wont be seen.
Well, Im comfortable here.
The question is,how does it look out there?
Considering most firmsare Ivy League only
and you dont evenhave a degree,
the landscapelooks very promising.
Who wants me?
Well, I can lista bunch of initials
or I could tell youwhat I really think.
Youre the expert.
Whats the best offer?
McCann-Erickson.
I dont want to go there.Thats why I called you.
I understand that.
Look, Im foregoinga commission here
because Im a career builder.
I want to help you find ajob over and over again.
And sooner or later,
youre going to have to gothrough a place like McCann.
Big company.Big products.
National influence.
You shouldnt stay longerthan three years,
but thats where you should go.
But what else is out there?
Plenty.
For a lot less moneywith a lot less cachet.
But you go to McCannand by 1973,
youll be looking atfour times the salary.
So thats it?
You couldve just calledme and told me this.
I want you to considerit seriously
before we take meetings.
Because word always gets outand McCann is vindictive.
Youre really selling it.
Its a huge opportunity.
(people shouting)
Come in.Glad you could make it.
- I feel like a spy.- You look like one.
We have caviar.
Your favorite red.Chateau Margaux 53.
Ill have a snort.
Look, ahem,
theyre dissolving the agency.
All the businessis moving to McCann.
They finally got you.
They ate you up.
We know it was hard enough to convinceyou to stay when McCann bought us.
I cant imagine how youfeel about things now.
Yeah, Im not going.
So we are proposing
that we retain our independencein our California office
with a few select clientswhove insisted on it.
Who else is going?
Burger Chef and Sunkist so far.
Its strictly for conflicts.
And, well, conflicts.
Tell your superiorsnothing is going to change.
I know I alwayscome at you g*n blazing,
but to them, Im still thenew guy and Eds son-in-law.
I cant suggesta move this bold.
Boldness is always rewarded,am I right, Pete?
I dont want to make Ken doanything he doesnt want to do.
Now he obviously thinks itsless bold to change agencies.
Youre wrong.Dow would be thrilled
to finally have all their accountsat McManus, John & Adams.
Kenny, you know thatwe know this account
inside and outand we have Don Draper.
Thats why you stayed anyway.
Thats true.
Weve done this before.
You know we can.
You know,Ive fantasized that one day
Id be in this situationwith you, Roger.
And, Pete, well,
youre not exactlyan innocent bystander.
Ive toyed with you long enough.
No.
Sorry about that.
(sighs)
How do I describe California in away that doesnt make them jealous?
Tell them my ex-wifelives there.
(chuckles) Mine, too, so what?
I know youre attachedto California.
I dont know what it means to you,but it doesnt mean anything to me.
It does mean something to me.
I always feel badabout taking your spot
when I saw what happened to you.
It should have beenyou out there, not me.
You were very persuasive.
I was misguided.
I met someone.
Shes not too young and shesgorgeous and a little bit deep.
Whered you finda girl like that?
I knew her in college.
Shes divorced, too,but no kids.
I bumped into heron Third Avenue
and we couldnt rememberwhy it didnt work out.
Oh.
Congratulations.
I hope you understand, she cant leaveNew York and I cant leave her.
Stop it. Youre helpingus by staying here.
Roger called.Dows a no.
Let me talk to Ken.
I suggested that and Rogersaid its quite final.
(sighs) Well, lets combthrough the small accounts.
See if we can cobblea couple million together.
Ill go get the files.
Do you want more coffee?
I want to get on with this.I have someplace to be, Trudy.
- Good morning.- Peter Campbell.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Well, I assume you know whywere here, Mr. MacDonald.
We feel theres been a mistakeregarding our daughter Tammy.
Its a Campbell family tradition
to receive the inimitable educationof Greenwich Country Day.
But you didnt go here.
No, but a Campbell has been inattendance since it was a barn.
(both chuckle)
Im sorry,but our decision is final.
Now, Trudy explained to me that yousaid its a question of space.
And I say Tammy wouldmake it worth your while.
She wouldnt feel extra at all.
Its not a question of space.
Your little girl scored verylow on her draw-a-man test.
Well, thats news to us.
And I find it hard to believe.
Your ex-wife and Idiscussed this.
Children have to draw a man
and their development is assessedbased on the volume of details.
Eyes, nose, ears, 10 fingers,10 toes, et cetera.
Your daughter had only a head,mustache, and necktie.
- Mustache?- She didnt understand what you wanted.
And Ive been told anythingbeyond a stick figure
is consideredadvanced for her age.
Albert Einstein didnt speakuntil he was four years old.
This is not aboutyour little girl.
The real problemis that your former wife
failed to submit applicationsto other schools.
That was careless and arrogant.
- What?- How dare you?
I think weve saidall there is to say.
Were not leaving untilyou apologize to Trudy.
Peter, it doesnt matter.
Einstein.
Would you like to step outside?
Are you sure you wouldnt ratherget me while Im sleeping?
Like a real Campbell?
Are you kidding me?
No MacDonald will ever mixwith a Campbell.
- (scoffs)- What are you talking about?
Its some stupid story.Its 300 years old.
Hes obviously nuts.
You should know that his clan tookadvantage of the gift of hospitality
and m*rder my ancestorswhile they slept.
The king ordered it.
Just be grateful you can remarryand get rid of that name.
Oh.
Come on, Trudy.
Another sucker punchfrom the Campbells.
Coward.
Im sorry, sweetheart,the auditions are finished.
I already auditioned.Im waiting for my mother.
Where is she?
She had to pick up my brother.
He has another audition.
Look, Phil, its a verysimple transaction.
Weve been doing it for years.
Shirley, will you watch her?
I have every right to be upset
because Im an important buyer andyoure acting like an assh*le.
Maybe we should go downstairs.
Ill see if Marshasback from lunch.
Do you know your phone number?
Did I get the part?
We havent decided.
Verna?
Her purse is gone. They must be atthe park. You should ice that hand.
No, this was a bad idea.I really should get going.
It was a wonderful idea. Tammywould love to see you by surprise.
Why did you only applyto one school?
I had a back up,
but...
I shouldnt tell you this.
You can tell me.
Well, the head of admissionswas a little fresh with me.
What school?
Peter, you cant punch everyone.
Maybe I shouldvenever left the city.
The citys become a toilet.
Well, its difficult out here.
I dont have a lot of friends.
I dont believe that.
Its the husbands.
I dont want to hear this.
Every time I wantto do something...
Go into town,any social event...
They wont leave me alone.
Then I think, "Who am I kidding?"
In 10 years, everyonewill leave me alone."
That is not true.
Youre ageless.
Im feeling sorry for myself.
This has been an ordeal.
Ill solve the schoolproblem in 30 days.
All it requires is a check.
- Tell Tammy I love her.- You never take no for an answer.
- Actually, can I use your phone?- Yes, of course.
- Wheres Pete?- He may be meeting us there.
Good, I made it.
- You need anything?- Not now.
I just talked SecorLaxatives into joining us.
- Go ahead.- Where they difficult to move?
All I had to dowas not make that joke.
- Shall we?- (elevator bell dings)
(laughs)
Hello, Susies office.How many I help you?
(sighs) Okay.
We got three boys, three girls.
- Top picks.- She has a lisp.
Lisps are cute.
We could pluck that eyebrow.
You know what? I dont care.You decide.


I know you dont mean that.
Okay.
You cant tell anyone.
- You cant even tell Elaine.- That wont be a problem.
- Why?- What is it?
McCanns taking over the agency.
Were moving over there.
- Jesus, to McCann?- Shh.
- (stapler clicks)- (screams)
- What happened?- I stapled my thumb.
Oh, its okay.
I know it hurts.It happens all the time.
Oh, great.Go get some ice.
- You get ice, Ill pull out the staple.- No.
Oh, here she is.
It was an accident.
- What is going on?- Ill get the first aid kit.
- She stapled her finger.- Susie Q, let mommy see.
- Very sorry.- Were going to the emergency room.
Its not that bad.
You shouldnt let a childplay with dangerous things.
You shouldnt have abandoned herin a midtown office building.
Its nobodys fault.
I had to go pick up my son
because your auditionran two hours late.
So you just left an eightyear old at a job interview?
This is her favorite thing.She loves it.
- And I bet you love cashing her checks.- Peggy.
You do what you wantwith your children,
I do what I want with mine.
How the hell did thatturn into that?
(inaudible) her.
I know you got other thingson your mind, but...
Lets just get back to work.
(sighs) Sure.
Im sorry to havekept you waiting,
but youre 20 minutes early.
We just wantedto get everything ready.
For what?
Gentlemen, would youplease have a seat?
You see that? We could usesome manners around here.
I dont know about that,
but we are here to discuss everythingwe can add to McCann-Erickson.
- So are we.- Go on.
Our agencies complimenteach other in so many ways.
But as we considered this union,
we were alarmedat how much business
we would all be giving updue to conflicts.
There will be casualties.
Sunkist Orange Juice,Burger Chef, Secor Laxatives,
and Tinker Bell Cookiescannot come along.
$18 million in billings.
But what if we couldservice those clients
from the modest officesof SC&P West?
The best part is wedstill be available to you
in any capacity you wish.
California.
Its a gold rush out there.
In fact, weve made several...
Don. Don.
Don, stop.This isnt necessary.
Jim, would you let him finish?
- Can you give us a minute?- Yes, absolutely.
- Do you want this?- No.
This is $275,000 in profit.
All cost covered that you donthave to lift a finger to earn.
Don, sit down.Please.
Im sick about the waythis was handled.
It made the whole thinglook very capricious.
I assure you, it wasnt.
And you have to believe me when I saywere rolling out the red carpet.
Were very excited about this.
- You can understand our attachment to our clients.- And our name.
I dont think youunderstand whats happened.
Its done.
You passed the test.
You are getting five of the mostcoveted jobs in advertising.
And all the resourcesthat go with it.
Travel, adventure.
An international presence.
I shouldnt have tosell you on this.
You are dying and goingto advertising heaven.
Buick.
Ortho Pharmaceutical.
Nabisco.
(whispers)Coca-Cola.
Stop struggling.
You won.
Take the rest of the day off.
Pop some champagne.
"I Followed My Heart" playing
I feel like I shouldmake a toast.
Again?
Well, we didnt drink to Cooper.
Glad he missed it.
Well, I have to go.
Kevin can wait.We should get dinner.
I have plans.
Come back after.
Actually, Ill drop you off.I should call Trudy.
She had quite a day as well.
We went down swinging.
Dont be a baby.Ill see you tomorrow.
Im going to get another round.
This is my last one.
I have a date.
You never worked at a placethis size, have you?
Its got a lot of advantages.
You never sawthe old Sterling Cooper.
- It was mammoth.- Not like this.
Youre happy about it.
Thats okay, I understand.
Im relieved.
Im ready to let someoneelse drive for a while.
Id like to make a toastto Lou Avery.
The Japs are going toeat him alive.
(both chuckle)
What a disaster.
Come on, Joan.
I need you to be the voiceof the bright side.
Hobart listed off accountsfor everyone but me.
Put you on Ortho Pharmaceutical.
No.
And I wouldnt counton anything he said.
I dont know.
For the first time, I feel likewhatever happens is supposed to happen.
Thats nice.
Thats what you shouldve said.
Well, we both know
theyre never going to takeme seriously over there.
They dont knowwho theyre dealing with.
I cant do any work.
(sighs)
Look, Ive huntedfor a job before,
and I may not have to,but I appreciate the warning.
No, I keep thinkingabout that woman.
Her kid got hurt.She felt guilty.
I know what she felt.
I understand the entirepsychological situation.
She shouldnt have talkedto me that way.
She shouldnt have kids.
Thats not for you to say.
Ah, Jesus, I canteven agree with you.
I dont hate kids.
Look, you got to a certainpoint in your life
and it didnt happen.
I understandyoure angry about it,
but youve gota lot of other things.
- Dont do that.- I mean it.
You couldnt have doneall youve done otherwise.
I guess thats the secretto your spectacular career?
The fact thatyou dont have kids?
Not that I know of.
Thats funny to you.
Because it wouldnt matter if you did.You can walk away.
I would never do that.
But you may not even know.Thats what you said.
"Stranger on the Shore" playing.
Its been a long day.
Youre right.
I didnt mean to judge her.
But you did and you dontunderstand it at all.
I had a mother.And she wasnt great.
And I dont know that she wantedme, so I understand something.
But you dont understandyour mother.
Well, maybe I dont want to.
Maybe she was very young.
And followed her heartand got in trouble.
And no one shouldhave to make a mistake
just like a man doesand not be able to move on.
She should be able to live the restof her life just like a man does.
Youre right.
I know.
Maybe you do what youthought was the best thing.
(sighs)
What did you do?
Im...
Im here.
And...
Oh.
Hes with a family somewhere.
I dont know,
but its notbecause I dont care.
I dont know because yourenot supposed to know.
Or you cant go onwith your life.
Im sorry.I didnt know that.
Well, ahem,
you dont know lots ofthings about lots of people.
Thats the point.
No, its not.
Im fine.
I have work to do.
You know, I made a deal withGod that if this worked out,
I would give up smoking.
Message received.
Youre a young man with anincredible future ahead of you.
("I Love So MuchAbout You" playing.)
No more Sterling Cooper
and no more Sterlings.
Margaret is the only daughterof an only son of an only son.
All thats left isa mausoleum at Greenwood.
Whats in a name?
Every copywriterthinks theyre Shakespeare.
Its something to aspire to.
I always envied that.
The way youre always reaching.
I always enviedyou didnt have to.
In another lifetime,Id have been your chauffeur.
Then you wouldve beenscrewing my grandmother.
- Do you have somewhere to be?- Im afraid so.
Tell her to join us.
She wouldnt like it.
You wouldnt like it.
Now Ive got to meet her.
You have.
Its Marie.
Marie Calvet.
Youre serious?
Guess I shouldveasked your permission.
Just warn mebefore you tell Megan.
- I want to leave the country.- She knows.
Then why didnt you tell me?
I wanted to make sureit wasnt going away.
Shes crazy, you know?
When I married my secretary,
you were hard on me.
And then you wentand did the same thing.
You know what?
For the second time today,I surrender.
- Im happy for you.- Thank you.
You are okay.
(siren wailing)
(knocks)
(TV playing)
Can I help you?
Im sorry. I must havethe wrong apartment.
Kenneth, do you know this guy?
Ive never seen him before.I swear.
No, I was looking for Diana Baur.She used to live here.
Oh. Well, we just moved in.
Do you know how to reach her?
She left her furniture. Themanager told us to sell it.
Sorry to bother you.
You want another drink?
Good morning.
What did Caroline say?
Theyre making lists.
Somebodys not going.
The last thing they needis another office manager.
Or another black girl.
Im Roger Sterlingssecond secretary.
Carolines going toelbow me out the window.
What are you talking about?
My goodness, Meredith.
We should put a bell on you.
Good morning.
What is going on?
There are rumors flyinglike bats around here.
What have you heard?
Nothing from you.
Are we going to McCannand am I going with you?
Meredith, sweetheart...
Dont "sweetheart" me.
In a month, youre notgoing to have an office
and youre not going tohave an apartment.
Do you want to lose me, too?
I was going to tell you today.
You are coming with meif you want to go.
Now, can I getsome Alka-Seltzer?
No.It is not a normal day.
Everyones living in a fright.
Youre right.
Get Mr. Sterlingon the line.
(phone ringing)
Marsha.
- This is Peggy.- Its me.
Where are you?
Locked in my office.
Bourbon with my breakfast.
Did you figure outwhat youre going to do?
Im going to McCann.
Really?
And you can too if you want.
You think I should?
Everythings going to be fine.
(sighs)
Im so dumb, I believe you.
Stay on the phone, will you?
Sure.
(murmuring)
Can I have your attention,everyone?
Some of youmay have heard already,
but were proud to announcethat Sterling Cooper & Partners
will be movingto McCann-Erickson.

Now our president,Roger Sterling,
would like to say a word.
We know this newsmay come as a surprise,
but McCann has assured us the transitionwill be as smooth as possible.

Theyve alreadyset aside room for us.
(murmuring continues)
This is good news.
We didnt do this.
Hold on.
This is the beginningof something...
not the end.
