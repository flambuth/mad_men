Mrs. Draper, sorry about the chill in here,
but my wife took the oil heater upstairs.
Im fine.
So, as I thought last week,
the spotting was not causedby your horseback riding,
but rather, as I suspected,
youre going to have another baby.
Really?
Well, weve been here before.
Youll have to starteating right, sleeping,
avoid strenuous activity,
no riding.
Just take it easy.
Thats what husbands are for.
I cant believe this.
I understand this was a surprise,
but blessings come that way.
Of course.
Ill need you to undressso I can examine you.
Dr. Aldridge, are you sure?
Are you concernedabout your appearance?
Youve been blessedwith a very resilient figure.
Dr. Aldridge, I canthave a baby right now.
Mrs. Draper, if were havingthe conversation I think were having,
there are alternatives, obviously.
But I find it hard to believe that,
as a married woman of means,
you would even be considering that.
That is an option for young girlswho have no other options.
I guarantee,
the minute you tell your husband,your friends,
youll stop worrying.
Get in the swing of things.
Lets see if I can wrestlethat heater from Charlene.
With love from Ken Cosgroveand Pete Campbell.
Whyd you need it today?
Cooper wanted the adrevenue projections early.
Why?
Great. Clearasil is missing.
Honestly, I dont know.
You dont think its anything to do
with Draper being AWOLin California, do you?
No, I figured that out.
Campbell says theresan aerospace gold rush.
I bet Drapers landing a big one.
I havent heard anything.
Or hes breaking off,opening his own shop in L.A.
Or hes finding a good spotfor Sterling Cooper West.
Id love to go to California.
I could get a convertible.
Whatever it is, theyre evaluating us.
If Kennedys speech goes past 8:30...
thats Lucy and then Danny Thomasand then Andy Griffith...
Ill take it in the shorts.
Why am I sick to my stomach?
Good. Youre here.
Im waiting on a callfrom North American Aviation.
Its 10:00 there.
They should just be getting into work.
I was just wondering if you told anybodyabout Clearasil yet.
I guess it must have slipped my mind.
I dont know whats going on,but Harry said
theres some kind ofemergency accounting.
Everybody had to turn intheir numbers early.
What am I gonna say to Duck?
That my father-in-law hates me?
Pete, just tell the truth.
Dont worry about the outcome.
People respect that.
Thank you.
I dont want you blaming Creative.
How long have you been here?
Half an hour.
I didnt want to bother you.
Where have you been?
You disappeared.
I had to have some timeto think about things.
Must be nice.
Needing time and just taking it,
all on your own terms,
not wondering what anybody thinks...
me, the children...
Bets.
Id do anything I couldto undo what happened.
What happened?
I was not respectful to you.
Well, now I know Im not crazy.
That helps.
I cant walk away from this.
I want to be with you.
I want to be together again.
I dont know.
Honestly, things havent been
that different without you.
I need to see the kids.
I cant deal with this right now, Don.
Ill call.
Well make arrangements.
Thank you for seeing me.
Whats your poison?
I dont know.
Its okay, Campbell.
Whatever youre having.
Sit down.
Clearasil is pulling out.
Sales are strong, Creative is strong,
but we are not suitedfor business together.
Your father-in-law.
Yes.
Thats a sticky wicket.
Indeed.
Im working on something to replace it.
Campbell, Im countingon your discretion here.
Okay.
The British agencyPutnam, Powell & Lowe
is taking a controlling shareof Sterling Cooper.
Clearasil is in conflictwith Lever Brothers.
Were merging...
well, being merged with.
Your loyalty and enthusiasmduring the American Airlines thing
showed real character.
Thank you.
Id like you to replace meas head of Accounts.
Im trusting you with this information
because I am goingto be the president
of the new Sterling Cooper.
Congratulations.
Congratulations to you.
I dont know what to say.
You say "Thank you,"and then you dont say anything.
Such news has to bebroken in the right way.
Is Don on board with my promotion?
Im the president.
I dont need his permission, do I?
Right.
If Don shows up, hell fall in line.
Hell have to,or find another profession.
Thats why God putnon-compete clauses in contracts.
Well...
thank you.
Good evening, my fellow citizens.
This government, as promised,
has maintained the closest surveillance
of the Soviet military buildupon the island of Cuba.
Within the past week,
unmistakable evidencehas established the fact
that a series of offensive m*ssile sites
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island.
The purpose of these basescan be none other
than to providea nuclear strike capability
against the Western Hemisphere.
Upon receiving the firstpreliminary hard information
of this nature,
last Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.,
I directed that oursurveillance be stepped up.
And having now confirmed...
...the Soviet Union
for supplying Cuba in thisnew military buildup
and asked Russia to stoparming Castros Cuba.
The President did not ordera direct military action...
Welcome back.
Hildy.
...if we are prepared
to sink Russian ships carrying...
...Eastern Daylight Time,
the Armed Forces of the United States
are under instructions to stop...
Mr. Draper, yourea sight for sore eyes.
Hello, Joan. Its good to be back.
How are you?
Like everyone else today,very distracted.
Don.
Hello, Peggy.
You look well. How was California?
Sunny.
Do I work for you now?
I hope its okay.
Mr. Sterling gave mepermission to switch.
I landed the Popsicle account.
So, other than her office and haircut,
is there anything newI need to know about?
After you.
The world continues without us.
Theres no reason to take it personally.
Do you want to knowif youve been missed?
Thats half your correspondence.
Mr. Sterling has been very anxiousto speak to you on a daily basis,
and Mr. Phillips, of course.
Ill need the copywritersand Sal in here
to get me up to speed.
Call Roger in a half an hour
and tell him Ill meet himin a half an hour.
And Mr. Phillips...
maybe Ill run into himin the mens room.
I sent your paychecks home.
I assume youve spoken to Mrs. Draper.
Did she call?
Not today.
I think thats enough to start.
We have a safety protocolfor Civil Defense.
I dont want to start a panic,
but I think peoplehave the right to know.
Trust me. I dont thinktherell be a point
in taking those stairsor diving under a desk.
So, youre back.
What happened?
One minute Im standingnext to you in the carport,
and the next Im tap dancingfor General Dynamics.
Sorry I missed that.
I cant drive, Don.
Its amazing I made any meetings at all.
But you did.
Of course I did.
Did you ever think Id left you there
because I thoughtyou could handle it?
How did it go?
Im this closeto North American Aviation.
Then I was right, wasnt I?
You handled it.
Good work.
I know you want everythingthe minute you want it.
Sometimes its betterto wait until youre ready.
So you think Im ready?
Yes.
You proved it.
Now I have to playa little catch-up ball.
Of course.
Welcome back, Don.
You wanted to see me?
About three weeks ago.
Hope you were lookingfor a job in California,
because youre going to need one.
Ill stack my absencesup against yours any day.
You cant just do that.
It was important.
And from what I can see,the walls are still standing.
They are.
But we sold them
and the rest of the companyto Putnam, Powell & Lowe.
What?
Its done.
Theyre coming in Fridayto discuss strategy,
management structure, and logistics.
Youll find one of theseburied in a stack of crap on your desk.
So how much?
Youll clear a littleover half a million dollars.
Best vacation you ever took.
Look who suddenlyhas nothing to say.
Duck put it together.
Ran into them in a bar or something.
Duck was in a bar?
He doesnt have a wife.
Any conflicts?
Well, Mona hasnt been pleasantsince my engagement.
No. With the deal.
But congratulations.
Thank you.
Very few conflicts.
Coop and Alice jumped on it.
I wasnt going to make trouble.
Well, now you can goback to your office
and figure outhow much I made on this.
I guess so.
Kennedys daring them to b*mb us,
right when I got a second chance.
We dont know whats really going on.
You know that.
As Mr. Khrushchev and Mr. Castro
push our leadership towardsthe threat of nuclear w*r,
it is tempting to be angry.
But I urge all of you to remember
that even on the cross
Jesus forgave his transgressors.
And although we cannot controlthese frightening events,
let us take charge of our own souls,
and let us prepare ourselves
for the most importantsummit meeting of all.
And so we pray.
We are all sinners, every one of us,
but at least give us the courage
and the common sense
to admit it,
to confess it,
and to repair it.
And give us the assurance
that when this temporarylife on earth ends,
we will be welcomedback into your arms
in your heavenly kingdom.
Amen.
Shes awfully quiet.
I think I know what thats about.
Shes terrified like the rest of us.
I think shes being smugbecause she has a b*mb shelter.
Really? I dont even like to goin the subway.
Theres no air.
I prefer you stop talking about this.
Youre upsetting my daughter.
Well, The Times says you should tellyour children the truth.
You tell your children.
Carlton says he heardthe market crashed
because there are Russiantroops off Key West.
Theyre closing the Interstate.
They cant do that.
Marie, Im about to leave.
Im done, okay?
Its nice to feel the warmthof the community in a time of crisis.
Mrs. Draper, Ill be with you in a minute.
I wish we had a shelterso I could slam the door in her face.
Betty, youre wan.
Do you want a Miltown?
Its the only thing thats keeping mefrom chewing my nails off.
No.
Im pregnant.
Congratulations?
Jessica was an accident.
Look how happy I am now.
Its not a good time.
But is it ever?
Look at this world we live in.
I cant do it.
What am I going to do?
Well, what can you do?
I dont think you understand.
Its not a good time.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Theres a doctor in Albany.
If you go to Puerto Rico,they do it in a hospital.
Of course you dont wantto go down there right now.
No.
Sometimes the best thing
is just to do nothing and wait.
Mrs. Draper, Im ready for you.
Ill come by and check on you.
No, Im fine. Youre probably right.
What are you doing in here?
And wheres Virginia?
The Soviets fired on us,
or we fired on themor something. Fix it.
I came in to get awayfrom this speculation.
Damn it. You see what you did?
I hope the Soviets got a guy like youto build those m*ssile.
Everyones lookingat each other in the street.
Theyre looking at youbecause youve got Castros beard.
Now they want a list of peoplein all the departments.
So? Thats you and Danny Lindstrom.
Theyre counting all the money.
Theyre counting all the people.
You said this was about an L.A. office.
You told us it wasnt bad.
Someone knows whats going on.
I swear, if it wasnt important,
I wouldnt have asked.
Were doing what we can.
The phone companyscompletely overloaded.
Actually, Lois,this is more of a security issue.
Certain calls may have been made
using the code words "Los Angeles. "
Lois, have you heard anything
about them openinga West Coast office?
You know Im not allowedto talk about what I hear in there.
You can tell us.
Its not going to hurt you.
Well really owe you.
Well...
Have you ever heardof Putnam, Powell & Lowe?
London?
Yes. Trans-Atlantic.
Mr. Phillips has made a dealfor them to buy Sterling Cooper.
No.
No!
Its done.They take the keys Friday.
Are they purchasingSterling Cooper,
or are they combining with them?
Its a merger.
From what we could put together,
they want a New York office,
and they want it filled with us,
but theres definitelygoing to be some...
redundancies.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
If any of you gets to stay,
one of you has to take meoff the switchboard.
Yeah. Of course.
If.
- Daddy!- Daddy!
We missed you.
I missed you, too.
I like your hotel room.
Theres a rollawaythere for you, Bobby.
We can go to the moviesor Chinese food.
I want you to behave yourselves,
and brush your teeth.
Do you want to join us?
Mommy doesnt like to eat.
No, I have plans.
Do you want to pick them upin my office tomorrow?
No, drop them off in the morning.
Im going riding. Carla will be there.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night, Mommy.
Can we order room service?
How can I help you?
Can I get a glass of water?
Sure.
What else?
I dont know.
A gimlet.
Thank you.
The gentlemans taken care of it.
Tell him I said thank you.
I will,
but it means hes goingto come talk to you.
Well see about that.
I think this is the place to be tonight.
I walked through Times Square.
Empty.
Doesnt seem real, does it?
Thats true.
You dont look worried.
Im trying not to think about it.
To not thinking about things.
Whats your name?
Thank you so much for the drink.
Id just like to enjoy it,if you dont mind.
No. Of course.
Nice meeting you.
...degrees for New York City.
Cloudy skies.
Further action of an unspecified nature
is being considered to deal
with the continuingSoviet m*ssile buildup in Cuba.
That statement fromDepartment Press Officer Lincoln White,
a revelationthat construction of m*ssile sites
is continuing.
Its delicious.
Youre crazy.
Can I have a milk shake?
Whats wrong with root beer?
Daddy?
Itll take 45 minutes, you know.
Daddy, knock-knock.
Whos there?
Dwayne.
Dwayne who?
Dwayne the bathtub.Mama, Im dwowning.
Can we watch TV?
Can you watch these for me, please?
What are you doing here?
Im waiting.
Im married.
I was just about readyto come by and pick you up.
I know, Wally, and Im sick about it.
I could just die.
Yeah, well, before you goand do something like that,
I got an idea.
What if I got Beaver to call your sister
and see if he couldtalk her into going?
Say, maybe that would work.
So what is your name?
What are you doing in there?
We were just about to close.
Anita wanted to come,but shes with the children.
Thats where she should be.
My mother baked.
Thought wed allappreciate something fresh
if we get stuck in here.
And how are you?
I dont know.
Nuclear w*r.
We could be gone tomorrow.
Well, isnt that always the case?
Thats true.
You believe in God.
Ive seen that in youfrom the moment we met.
Sometimes I feel
he called me to this parishto reach you.
No. I didnt know that.
Well, its true.


Hell is serious and very real,
and unless you unburden yourself,
you cannot know peace.
I understand that, Father,
but youre upsetting me right now.
That is your guilt, Peggy.
All that God wants is for youto reconcile with him.
Dont you understand
that this could be the end of the world
and you could go to hell?
I cant believe thats the way God is.
Good night, Father.
Really? The silver?
There could be looting.
A mob is going to come
to the 14th floorof this apartment building?
I wish you would come with me right now.
What if something happens?
Rehoboth Beachis 90 minutes from D.C.
You dont understand these b*mb.
Your parents deck chairswill be on Fifth Avenue.
Are you trying to make me more upset?
If for some reasonthe train doesnt work,
just take a few hundreddollars in cash
and pay someone to drive you.
This is ridiculous.
If Im going to die,I want to die in Manhattan.
Stop that kind of talk, Peter.
Theres no difference, Trudy.
And I want to be here,
and you want to be with your parents.
Why do you alwaysmake it about that?
And yes, I love my parents,and they love me.
Do you?
If you did, youd want to be with me.
Youre right.
Ill help you pack the car.
The first Russian shipthat proceeded through the area
patrolled by our Navy forces...
Bad news.
What?
The conference rooms signed out all day.
And I checked the fridge.
Theres canap?s, really good ones.
They shampooedthe carpets last night.
Campbell.
PPLs coming in today.
You told me she told you that.
Youre not worried?Whyd you come in?
I dont know.
Im just waiting to see what happens.
I talked to my father-in-law about it.
Regime change is always tricky.
You want to stay neutral.
The loyalists are always hung,
and you dont want to getcaught in the fallout.
Whats wrong with you?
Arent you loyal to anyone?
They dont care about us.
Were just a bunchof salaries on a ledger.
Theyll draw a lineand get rid of everything below it.
I like this company the way it is.
Have a minute?
From the look of this,that might be all I have.
May I?
Im coming to you anonymously, Don.
I know somethingI think you should know.
What?
I know about the merger,
and I know that Duck Phillipsis going to be the president.
How do you know that?
He told me.
Why would he do that?
Picking sides, I guess.
Why are you telling me this?
I dont know.
I just thought if I was you,
I would want to know.
Thank you.
You know they stoppeda ship this morning.
I bet the Russians are reconsidering,now that we made a stand.
Carla, whats this?
Thats from Mr. Draper.
"Dear Betty,
"Im sitting in the Roosevelt
"looking at the backsof Bobby and Sallys heads
"as they watch TV.
"Im not letting themchange the channel
"because watchingthe news makes me sick,
"and they can see it.
"I think about youand how I behaved
"and my regret.
"I know its my faultyou are not here right now.
"I understand why you feel
"its better to go on without me,
"and I know that you wontbe alone for very long,
"but without youIll be alone forever.
"I love you.
Don. "
Gentlemen, now that weve donehaggling over the dowry,
its time to slip into the tentand spend a night with the bride.
We imagine that Sterling Cooperwill remain somewhat autonomous.
You bought us.
We dont expect autonomy,
but whos going to be minding the storewhen you all fly back to England?
Since weve worked with him before
and he knows both companies,
Duck Phillips will bePresident of Sterling Cooper.
My goodness.
Obviously, I accept.
That makes sense.
Congratulations.
Well, I promise, in spite of this title,
I will treat the foundersof Sterling Cooper
with the respect they deserve.
Duck, it has now become your meeting.
Tell us what you see.
I find myself a little unprepared here,
but I know this.
Id like to bring this companyinto financial maturity.
The last two years,weve been held back.
Good Creative is important,
but it cant be running the show.
Our business is aboutbuying time and space,
and right now that means television.
The bigger we are,the cheaper we can get it.
I dont think I heardthe word "client" once.
Well, Bert,when the economy is good,
people buy things,
and when its bad, they dont.
Theres no reason for us to be tiedto Creatives fantasies of persuasion.
It certainly is an ambitious wayof thinking about things.
What?
I think it sounds like a great agency,
and I think Duck is the man to run it.
I just dont think Ill be a part of it.
You dont want to be a part of it?
If this is the agency you want,
Duck is the man for the job.
This is what Im talking about.
Artistic temperament.
Don, is this really necessary?
It is.
Because he loves this room
and hearing his own voiceand saving the day.
Except this time,hes got to get with the team.
Don, you can either honor your contract
or walk out that door with nothingand start selling insurance.
I dont have a contract.
Were close.
We didnt think we needed one.
Gentlemen.
I sell products, not advertising.
I cant see as far into the future as Duck,
but if the world is still here on Monday,
we can talk.
Don, hold on.
Let him go.
Itll take a second to find some kid
who can write a prose poemto a potato chip.
Calm down.
Let him throw his tantrum.
The man disappearedfor three damn weeks,
and I put this deal together.
What more do you need to know?
Duck, would youexcuse us for a minute?
Of course.
This doesnt affect the merger, does it?
No.
He never could hold his liquor.
Mr. Draper, your wife called.
She wants you to come home.
You should go home as well.
I cant even think right now.
Greg says they put St. Lukes on alert.
Your bag.
I dont need it.
Good night.
...this correspondent
that there is morefirepower now in Cuba
than at any time during World w*r...
Why are you smiling?
Because youre still here.
I was hopingthe train would be empty.
Have a drink with me.
Okay.
Why are you still here?Trudy must be worried.
What is it with you?
What?
You never let me talkabout what I want to talk about.
What do you want to talk about?
About what you said about the truth.
Can I tell you the truth?
Why wouldnt you?
You make it so hard.
What are you talking about?
You.
Ive been thinkingabout everything thats going on.
And I thought...
whod care if I was gone?
I mean, Trudy would care,
but she doesnt know me.
But you do.
And I know you.
And I think youre perfect.
Im not perfect, Pete.
Yes, you are.
And I wish I had picked you then.
Pete.
I love you.
And I want to be with you.
What?
Didnt you know that?
Pete,
I could have had you in my life foreverif I wanted to.
What do you mean?
I could have had you.
I could have shamed youinto being with me.
But I didnt want to.
I dont understand.
You got me pregnant.
I had a baby,
and I gave it away.
What?
I had your baby,
and I gave it away.
Are you serious?
You cant be serious.
I wanted other things.
I dont understand.
Well,
one day youre there...
and then, all of a sudden...
theres less of you,
and you wonder
where that part went,
if its living somewhere outside of you.
And you keep thinking...
maybe youll get it back.
And then you realize...
its just gone.
Why would you tell me that?
Im sorry, Pete.
- Daddy!- Daddy!
Youre home.
At about 2 p.m.
yesterday afternoon,
set out to intercept the Marucla.
She was assistedby S2Fs tracker aircraft.
The Pierce made contactwith the Marucla...
They finally went down.
...at about 10:30 p.m. last night,
Eastern Daylight Time.
Sometime after midnight...
I have to talk to you.
the Pierce was joined by the destroyerJoseph R. Kennedy.
I have something to tell you.
What?
Im pregnant.
