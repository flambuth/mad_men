Im worried thatsgonna hit the ceiling.
We always get a tall one.
Not tallerthan the living room.
Lets go back to the other one
And stand next to it.
Hey, Sally. Sally.
Hello.
- Its Glen.- I know that.
Well, you all just walkedright by me when you came in.
Sorry.
What are you doing back here?
My mom got married and now Imsupposed to live with him.
I saw your new dad.My mom said that would happen.
After theyre married awhile,theyll have a baby.
You should probably askfor something big now.
Hi. Are yougetting a tree?
No, Im working.
- What do you do?- I bring twine over.
I get to cut it.
- Wow.- Yeah, I made it.
Those are good colors.
Were leaving as soonas I find you.
- Bye, Glen.- Maybe Ill call you.
- Good time, bad time?- Yes.
Youve got a resume
From the girl you metat the Ziegfeld theater.
- File it.- Al Weaver at Johnson wax
Requested anotherprint of glo-coat.
And you got this veryimportant piece of mail.
Open it.
dear daddy, Bobby thinks thisis going to the north pole
But we shouldkeep up the roos.
- R-double-o-s.- Too much television.
Bobby says he knowsthat he doesnt deserve
A heath Kit radiobecause of what happened
With leaving the freezeropen in the garage
But maybe Santa could choose froma bicycle, a better pellet g*n,
A clock radio,a transistor radio,
A drum setand a bicycle.
I left that freezer open.
baby gene wants a fireman.
I dont knowwhat that means.
Adorable.
and I would likethe gold necklace
That you can put your initialson that we saw at Macys.
And most of all, Id like youto be here on Christmas morning
To give it to me,but I know you cant be.
Im sorry.
So a drum set, a fire truck...
The necklace is $30.
Its s. B.D....Sally Beth draper.
And...
Get her some b*at 45s
And him a transistor radio too.
Um, the girls went to Joan
And I dont wantto undermine her,
But are we allowed to bring afriend to the Christmas party?
Lane scaled it back
To a glass of ginand a box of Velveeta.
Were tightening our belts.
But you will begetting a bonus,
Even if I have tosee to it myself.
Well, thank you.
I didnt want to haveto write a letter to Santa.
- Do you want this?- Sure.
Send him in.
Ready Freddy.
Its been too long.
Nah, just long enough.
You look good.Have a seat.
Jeez.
It looks likean Italian hospital in here.
I know, I know.Jane got a decorator.
I feel like with my hairyou cant even see me in here.
- Something brown?- Maybe later.
What time is it?Oh, look at that.
So I thought itd be best if Ibroached this opportunity in person.
Well, dont be fooledby the setup here.
Its Potemkinville.
Well, maybe I can help.
I walked out of j.W.T.
With a present under my arm...ponds cold cream.
Its $2 million, but theyllnever even notice its gone.
How the hell did you do that?
Suffice it to say
The client and I arein a fraternity together.
I cant handlethe account myself,
But Im clean and sober now...
16 months without a drop.
- So when you said maybe later?- What am I gonna say?
Look, if it doesnt work out,you can keep the account.
What am I gonna say?
Yes.
There is one little caveat.
Name it.
I feel like Im gettingsucked into that thing.
I dont wantPete Campbell near this.
I was surprisedyou took him along.
No comment.
Sugarberry has been selling hams for30 years at a fairly steady rate
While doing in everythingthey could to create sales,
And then we do this in a month.
We have to give them timeto reconcile that.
- Freddy!- Ballerina.
I feel like the tin man.
Good to see you.
How are you, Freddy?
Couldnt be better.
I was just talking about you.
Freddy here justran in from the yard
With a $2-million accountin his mouth.
- Ponds cold cream.- Well, that explains why you look so good.
A little early for that,isnt it, don?
Very funny.
The pedigree of this accountis that it was boosted.
And Ill need to maintain mypersonal contact to it creatively.
If thats all rightwith you, don.
If you dont mind workingwith this old thing over here.
I was counting on it.
- Oh, none for me.- Oh.
- When can you bring em in?- Ill be handling this one, Pete.
Well, Freddy,I hate to bring this up,
But I do believeits on everyones mind.
We all want to know if you canbe Santa at the Christmas party.
Its the roleI was born to play.
Francis residence.
Can Sally come to the phone?
Who may I say is calling?
Stanley. I havea question about homework.
Sally, theres a young manon the phone... Stanley.
- Hello?- Its Glen.
Oh, hi.
Dont you wanna know whyI said my name is Stanley?
I guess.
Because this is private.
- Where are you?- Where do you think?
Im down the streetat my moms.
How come you didnt move?
I dont know.
I hate it here.I really really do.
Why?
I wont tell anybody.
Every time I goaround a corner,
I keep thinkingIll see my dad.
Sorry.
- Theyre not gonna get backtogether, you know. - Glen?
Especially now that shesdoing it with somebody else.
- Doing what?Glen!
Well, dont worry.
One day theyll wake upand theyll want to move.
Youll see.Ive gotta go. Bye.
Goodbye.
- Whos Stanley?- A boy.
We will soon be chargingclients for this service
And Dr. Atherton willin turn be charging us.
Significantly less.
Bert and I have been meaningto work together for years.
Out in the open at least.
Very good then.Shall we dim the lights?
No, beginning the presentationwith the film is a mistake.
Audiences will listento anything in anticipation.
See what I was talking about?
Simply said, we believe that atthe motivational research group,
We have brought the scienceof consumer evaluation
To a point of precision likethat of a surgeons scalpel.
No doubt, with the help of mindslike Dr. Faye Miller,
With whose work you arealready unknowingly familiar.
Faye helped developthe indelible image
That has become the standard offeminine hygiene advertising...
The carefree galin white pants.
Its right up therewith the polio vaccine.
Beyond demographicinformation...
Salary, age,marital situation...
Weve tried to finda way to select prospects
Who can really provide insight.
This test is our beginning.
Take a minute, fill it out
And please take a cookie.
Whats it mean if we dont?
That youre a psychopath.
The point of this exercise is
To familiarize youwith our methods.
The point of the cookies is that everyoneshould be rewarded for their time.
These questionshave been designed
To get at whatsubjects really want
Instead of whatthey say they do.
What are the real feelingsthat exist below the surface?
For example, how would youdescribe your father?
No matter what the answer,
It creates a level of intimacyfor the next question,
who makes decisionsin your household?
Theres some pencilsif you need them.
I apologize.I have an appointment.
That is yours to keep.
- Is that work? - No, its me.Its kind of silly.
Tell me when they pull thecurtains so I can get out of here.

We wave to each other.
You met my friend Sarah.She fell on the stairs.

You always grunt when you putyour keys in the door.

I really appreciatethe invitation, Phoebe,
But Im late for work.
So you should thank mefor waking you.

All of their research says thattheyre trying to get young women.
Well, young womenlook up to older women.
For beauty tips?Are you joking?
I know the client.This thing is rigged.

People are lookingat everything we do here.
Have you seen our work?Its very different than this.

It happened.In fact, he was offended
That we hadntinvited him already.
Uninvite him.
Take him to the four seasons.He can have three entries.
This man doesnt careabout food.
I know that youve lived yourlife from a bottomless pocket,
But theres a very real system of moneycoming in versus money going out.
Overtime, suppliesbeing used carelessly,
Leaving the lights on,parties... it adds up.
Listen, Olivier, arent you theone whos always talking about
How lucky strike is 99%of our business or something?
69% if we landponds cold cream.
We have ponds and I hatethe way you say percent,

I dont think hes the onewho needs to be reminded.
Oh, come on.
He was all over you the timeyou wore that red dress...
The one with the bow in the backthat makes you look like a present.
- You have an incredible memory.- Yeah, I think about it a lot...
That dress, I mean.
- Could you wear it?- Stop it.
I didnt mean it that way.
All I was saying was this isthe office and thats life.
This is good

Fresh, dewy, well cared for?
Let me get a better look.
You taste like soap.
Im in the middleof a seven-day beauty plan.
Cant we just
Get undressedand lie together again?
That was a bad idea.
How long is this gonna go on?
Oh, Im sorry you feelyouve put in the time.
- Were not doing anything.- Were doing some things.
Were not doing anythingI cant do myself.
Mark.
I told you I want you.
In fact I want youso much I wanna wait.
And I told you theresnothing to be afraid of.
I want to be your first.
Youre so old-fashioned.
No, Im not.
In Sweden, they make love
The minute they feel attracted.
And its healthier,because you can find,
You know, the perfect person.
Because making love is a very importantpart of a life with someone.
The most important.In Sweden, anyway.
Where did you hear that?
I read this article,the Swedish way of love.
Its very enlightened.
Youre never going to get me todo anything Swedish people do.
All you have to do is take acouple of steps that way.
- I brought you cookies.- Huh.
I think you should go home.
And I want youto think about that.
Sorry.Everybody leaves
The momentyou have to clean up.
I might have a vacuum.
Where the hell areyou coming from?
- Work.- Where do you work?
The white horse tavern?
Did you havea party or something?
- I hate parties.- And you hate Christmas.
- I got it.- I dont hate Christmas.
I hate this Christmas.
Of course you have heat.
Can I get you something?
Come on.Youre going to bed.
Look where we are.
- Youre good with that.- My father was a drunk.
If you dont behave yourself,
Im not gonna takeyour shoes off
And youre gonna wake upwith sores on your heels.
How can you stand goingto a hospital every day?
I love workingat the hospital...
People coming into the world,
People leaving it.
Everything happens there.
Good night, don.
Good night!
Against the wall,please. Megan.
The bar looks good.I need you to get
The chafing dishesand the sternos.

That one.
On the short list Ive gotTallulah, Jessica Tandy,
Barbara Stanwyck and Doris day.
- Different types.- I dont even understand your list.
Whats wrongwith Elizabeth Taylor?
Isnt it about makingold ladies look good?
Nothing makesold ladies look good.
But ponds does.Thats the point.
If young girlsstarted using it,
Maybe theyd find a husbandand they wouldnt be so angry.
All I was trying to sayis that Ive used the stuff
And I think theres somethingabout the experience
Of putting it onand looking in the mirror.
If we were to go another way,thats not a bad idea.
Indulging yourself, right?
No, if you use ponds,youll get married.
Thats not what I was saying.
Or we could go the other way.
If you dont use it,then youll never get married.
Which is better?
You know what?Just write em down.
No, Im not writing that down.
Im sorry if I hita nerve there, precious.
You know, Freddy, I havebrought your name up 100 times
In the last year to come inand freelance, for me,

Everybodys leaving to getdressed for the party.

Where the hell is he?
They are children,
And they cant accept the fact
That others have to makedecisions for them.
So we are not part of thisherd youre talking about.
Youre from Great Britain.
Id think youd be familiarwith the perils of socialism.
Civil rights is the beginning
Of a slippery slope.
If they pass Medicare,
They wont stop untilthey ban personal property.
Storm our housesand r*pe our wives.
Mmm. Mmm.
Man your battle stations!
Nice dress.Wheres Mr. Holloway?

I would but Imallergic to velvet.
Come on. Youll do great.

Besides, everybody knowsSantas got white hair.

Hes a hell of a sport.
Everybody just stay there.

You really area full-service company.

And I know youre thecreative shaman around here,
But you walked outof my presentation.
Im disappointed.
I thought you came in to flirt,but you came in to fight.
You have to know I found outall I could about you.
Your work is very interesting
And I guess I was hopingyou thought mine was.
Its not personal.I just dont think
You can learn muchabout people that way.
I learned a lot about you.
Youre the kind of man whodoesnt want to take the test.
Im sorry.I just dont see

I saw that ad.
Its all aboutsomebodys childhood.
Look, were bothin the same business.
Im not embarrassed to say

And what is that?
In a nutshell,
It all comes down to what I wantversus whats expected of me.
- Thats true.- I know its true.
You wouldve known its true ifyoud stayed for my presentation.
Want to get some dinneror something?
No thank you.

Hey, you brought it up.
I havent done much work onthis, I have to be honest.
I need to get some coffee.
Fine.
I dont want to be aloneon new years eve.
My two cents?
If youre gonna marry him,you cant do anything.
He wont respect you.
What if I dont know?
Well, you cant lead him on.
That is physicallyvery uncomfortable.
Its not a joke.
Did you enjoy thefuhrers birthday?
May he live fora thousand years.
Oh, my father used to say thisis the greatest job in the world
Except for one thing...the clients.
Good morning.

On too many occasions.
Excuse me?
