Im learning.
- Oh my God.Youre a slob. - Shh!
We have to be quiet.I have a roommate.
God, I love your shoulders.
You look likeyoure in the Olympics.
You never stop talking.
It was like the movies.One minute were listening
To a lecture on rhododendrons,
The next, Patricia is driving
Like a speed racerto the hospital.
And Trudy keeps apologizingin the back seat.
Were saying,"its okay. Nobody cares.
Youre having a baby!"
Meanwhile,Campbells on the back nine
With his father-in-law,whos also a client.
Well, thats a nice wayto end a round.
Ken Cosgrove.Dont get up.

Whenever ad men meet, all theyever do is brag and brag.
Its hard not to get rattled.
Ed, Lillian,youll have to excuse me.
Sweetheart, I swear toyou I wouldnt do this
If it wasnt serious.
Ken!What a pleasant surprise!
Theres nothing muchto celebrate yet.
They were going to send Trudyhome, but her mother protested.
I sent her for foodjust to get rid of her.
Anyway, I supposeyour visit is premature.
- ? shouldnt use that word around here.- Can I talk to you?
John Flory, some prickover at b. B.D.O.,
Just told me that luckystrike is going there.
What?
You made me wait for you
While you worked.
Im not waiting anymore.

- No. - Ken heard fromsomebody at b. B.D.O
- That Luckys coming over.- Bullshit. Call Roger.

I have to make a call.
Hello?
- Whats going on?- Ken here
Heard that lucky strikeis leaving.
- That theyve already left.- What?

Im telling youits impossible.
Dont lose your temper.
Somebody call lane in London?
Yeah, I dont thinkhell go back to sleep.
Could I get a drink?
Its ringing.
Lee.Roger sterling.
From your agency?
Well, its serious.
Hes drunk.
Youre damn right I heard.
Because you can consolidateyour business here.
Just because your fathersnon compos mentis
Doesnt mean you haveto listen to the board.
Its bullshit! Lee!
30 years?
I have to hear iton the street?
No review?Nothing?
He hung up.
Its true?
Tomorrow morning were getting onthe 6:00 A. M. To Raleigh-Durham.
Ill do it.
Ive known him half my life.
I need a drink.
- What time is it?- Midnight.
You want one?
Looks like you need both.
It looks like lucky strikemight have gone South.
Holy crap.
Obviously wed like to avoidthat information getting out.
What happened?
Supposedly,theyre consolidating
For a reduced commissionat b. B.D.O.
Hey, watch it.You have to keep a clear head.
Every day, I tried notto think about what would happen
If this happened.
Aw, look at that plum.
- Whats that?- That face.
Youre the most hirable manon Madison Avenue.
Im not at that point yet.
Okay.
- Wheres Trudy?- Her mothers got her all worked up.
She made such a stink.And that things at least another day away.
Can I see her?
Have you been drinking?
You need to calm down.
I was at a ballgamewhen Trudy was born.
Go about your business.
Are you all right?
Could I speakwith you candidly?
Always.Id like to think
Im more to you thana typical father-in-law.
You are. Thats the problem.Its about business.
Theres no businessin here, son.
We may have lost lucky strike.
Im sure this agencywas a thrill,
But youve had your folly.
Thats not right, Tom.
I havent stayed at Vick chemicalfor 28 years because I love it.
Its because I have a family.Any minute here, you will too.
- This still can work.- ?m not rooting against you.
Youve got my account,for Gods sake.
Its just...
Youre a frequent topicat c. G.C.
Apparently you werea tough act to follow
- When we moved Clearasil over there.- Ted Chaough?
- ? hate him.- Hes a good guy.
Hes not interested in me.Hes just trying to hobble don.
Theres no rewardin going down with the ship.
I have an agency.Im a partner.
I found him.
He was down at the candymachines dozed off.
- Can I see her?- No.
She finally went to sleep.
Why dont you just go back
To the candy machinesand well wait?
Im sorry about that.
The air conditioning guyssupposed to be there at 8:00.
I guess Ill see you then.
You dont want me to go?
I want you to dowhatever you usually do.
Hey, I dont usuallydo anything.
- Really? - Cant you tellby how badly Im leaving?
Im not letting you leave.
What about your air?
Youre unbelievable.
Im sorry.Im not usually like this.
- Hello?- ? just walked out of there.
Its over.
- ? see.- Since his father got sick,
The board took over.Theres no point in talking to them.
He saidwe did good work.
Our clients needto hear this from us.
I know, Bert.Dont wait for me.
Im standing byLees receptionist.
I didnt want to have to payfor the long-distance call.
Very well then.
Lane Pryce isnt coming back.
Thats my guess.
I think theyddo that in a memo.
I got $5 that saysCoopers retiring.
No champagne?
Id say hes got cancer.
Its in bigger print now.
Everyone? ?f we could haveyour attention, please?
- Bert.- Ahem.
"we have called this meetingof our nearest and dearest"
To let you knowof a change in the agency.
After 30 yearsof consummate service,
American tobacco hasreluctantly decided
To consolidate their business
"At batten, Barton,Durstine & Osborn."
Damn it.
"so what does this mean to you?
Partner, creative director."
Pete Campbell and Ken Cosgrove
Will handle calls to clients.
Those are the only callswe want made with this news.
Now weve hada pretty good year.
Weve gained more accounts
Than weve lost, a lot more,
Because our work isthoughtful and effective...
Even lucky strike said so...
Which means thatnothing should change.
Nothing will change.
Were gonna push ourselvesshoulder to shoulder
And were gonna overcome thisand succeed tenfold
And it will be exhilarating.
Joe?
As don said,nothing is going to change.
Theres only asmall modification in policy.
Anythingout of the ordinary
Must be approved by myself,Joan Harris or lane Pryce.
That said,
Inquiries as to paychecksand advances...
- Whats going on?- Thats the head of accounting.
What do you thinks going on?
Any questions?
Nothing?
Okay. If you wantto talk to me individually,
Ill be in my office.
- What happened?- We lost lucky strike.
Jesus.
But it sounds likeeverythings under control.
Ive got to go to a meeting.
Peggy, Freddy, Danny,Stan... in my office.
Were in some trouble here.
Creative needs to beon its toes.
Is it a "last hired,last fired" sort of thing?
Youre in this room.Thats all I can say.
Now myselfand the other partners
Will be out there b*at thebushes for new business,
But creatives job is tohold on to what we have.
That means clients ideas shouldseem better than they normally do.
For the next few weeksthe only words you know
- Are "yes, sir."- Yes, sir.
That means, Stan, you babysitthat Samsonite sh**t every day.
Peggy, the Playtex presentationis still set for tomorrow.
Ill bring in my notes.I can prep you in 10 minutes.
No. Youre stillgonna do it.
Itll look desperateif Im suddenly involved.
- So what about it then?- Be successful.
Im not worried.
Okay. Lets skipthe gossip out there.
Get to work.
Peggy?
Youre not worried?
I don-t know.You seem to have everything in hand.
Should I be worried?
We dont even knowhow bad this is gonna be
Until lane shows up.
Every time somethinggood happens,
Something bad happens.I knew Id pay for it.
Youre not paying for anything.
But Im counting on you.
Close that, will you?
- Joan Harris.- Joanie, Im glad youre there.
Im so sorry.
I feel so guilty.
Its not your fault.
I need to see you.
I need you to come down here.
Im not flying to Raleigh.
- When do you get back?- No, Im here.
What are you talking about?
Mr. Cooper saidhe spoke with you.
He did, but I didnt go.
Damn it, Roger.Get on a plane.
Youre very persuasivein person.
Theres no point.
Its been over for weeks.Garner was supposed to give me a month.
The bastardcouldnt keep to it.
You knew about it?
I cant believe you.We couldve done something.
Dont yell at me.You know what its been like
Walking around with this?I got a hole in my gut.
What am I supposed to dowith this information?
Im sorry.
But I need you to knowwhy I need you to see you.
You shouldve told me.
Why didnt you tell me?
I kept meaningto say something.
I thought I still had time.I dont know.
I should go.Theres a lot of work to do.
Come after work.
Im at the Statler.
I had to stay awayfrom midtown.
Ill have to see.
I think my setup is good,
But don always has theselittle examples at the end
That explain to the clienthow big the idea is.
Theyre always kind of poetic.
So get don to write it.We cant lose this.
Since when do we have donuts?
Condemned man always getshis choice of a last meal.
You know what Pete Campbelljust said to me?
He said if anybody sendsa resume out of here,
- Theyre gonna get executed.- Fellas, were on an account right now.
Playtex glovesprotect a womans hands
So theyre soft enough to touch
All the thingsa woman wants to touch.
All the things?
The exciting thingsshe wants to feel
With her fingertips.
His lips.
The tuft of hair on his chest.
The small of his back.
I cant imagine donsaying that.
Excuse me.I have a delivery for Peggy Olson.
- What? - Are you Peggy Olson?Its c. O.D.
Let me get my purse.
Go ahead without me. Im gonnatake care of this and then practice.
Am I wrong or is shegiving it off?
Well,its the last days of Rome.
I was in an agencythat went down.
The womenget sex-crazed.
The energy is very good.
They said they wantedto revise the media plan,
But I think what theyreally wanted was a budget
To see how much of their moneywe havent spent yet.
- Who are we talking about?- Birds-eye.
Why are we worryingabout existing accounts?
If anything, theyre goingto get more attention.
Because theyre afraidwe wont be here.
I have news from London.
Pete, wake up.
Lane thinks our billings are probablyaround $22 million without lucky,
But he has to lookat everything in person.
Whens he coming?
As soon as he can.
David Montgomerys memorialis tomorrow afternoon.
In case we need cheering up?
The man was seniorvice president of accounts
At the #4 agency.
Theres gonna be a lot ofvulnerable clients in attendance.
- ? think Roger knew him.- Sorry to interrupt.
- ?ts Al Weaver from glo-coat.- What does he want?
- ? dont know.- Do you want me on the call?
Didnt you talkwith him this morning?
No.
- Al, how are you?- Hello, don.
Im glad I could reach you.I just wanted to let you know
We appreciate everythingyouve done for us,
But weve decided to take theaccount in a different direction.
- All right, Al... - ? want you toknow it wasnt an easy decision.
- Now can I talk?- Sure.
I dont think you understandwhats happened here.
And Im not talking aboutlosing lucky strike.
- Lucky strike didnt enter into it.- Really?
So that has nothingto do with this?
Don, its a simple coincidencethat it happened now.
Okay, youre right.It is bad timing.
How can you blame usfor wanting to move on?
Because that commercial,that little cowboy kid,
Was the first successfulstrategy youve been near
Since you sponsored fibber McGee and Molly.We won the Clio!
- You won the Clio.- With work we did for you!
With your direction!
Believe me,we know how it looks,
But its just business,plain and simple.
Im coming out there.Were gonna talk about this in person.
Im sorry, don.The decisions been made.
I just thoughtyou should hear it from me.
You know were gonna wantanother sh*t at this soon.
As long as youre around.
Well be here.Dont worry.
Good luck, don.
I hope we can worktogether again sometime.
- Okay.- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
What was that?
Nothing.
- Do you want ice?- No, but I need a favor.
- Make sure I dont overdo it.- Okay.
How do I... um,its hard to tell with you.
Stop me at three.This is one.
The doctor says they never letthe labor go past two sunsets.
What exactlyis the problem?
Apparently Trudyspelvis is too small
And the babys shoulderscant get through.
- They should cut it out.- They dont like to start there.
Go to the hospital.Theres nothing to do here.
- ?ts obviously what matters to you.- What?
I dont know what the hell yousaid to them this morning.
So, Joan, that puts us at what?20 million and change?
Are you doubting my efforts?
All you had to do was tellthem everything was fine.
You think that callseasy to make?
I think youre distracted.
Because of that, I think youscared the shit out ofem.
Who the hell do you thinkyoure talking to?
Dont blow a gasket.
He called looking for me and mysecretary told him where I was.
Incredible.
That was something else.
There he is...the man of the hour.
Ted. How considerateof you to stop by.
I wish the babywas here already,
But Im sure everyonefeels that way.
Good news is alwaysworth waiting for.
Dont letyour vanity get the best of you.
There is nothing wrongwith being called grandma.
Its a rattle.You can get it engraved.
Ogilvy sent me onewhen my son was born.
Thank you.What do you want, Ted?
No, this is aboutwhat you want.
I mean, youre aboutto have everything
The minute that baby comes.
You know your father-in-lawnever stops talking about you?
He doesnt know the half of it.
Youve brought in a little businesssince you went out on your own...
Glo-coat, life cereal,
Sugarberry hams,Vick chemical obviously,
Mountain dew, Fillmoreauto, birds-eye, ponds?
I didnt do all that by myself.
Pete, as far as Im concerned,youre whats missing from c. G.C.
Jim cutlers due to retire.
"Campbell, Gleason & Chaough"?
Has a nice ring to it.
Wouldnt you wantyour name first?
Im open to it if werehaving that discussion.
Youll havea full voting third.
Im not don.
Its not the wild West.
We just got Alfa romeo...little Italian sports car.
I dont know if youve heard of it, but Ithink youll really enjoy driving one.
- ? dont drive.- ?ll teach you.
Tom, Jeannie,my offer still stands.
If you want a hotel room, I canget you one across the street.
Roger.I let you come over
Because you said you needed to talk.We can talk.
- Joanie, I need you.- Stop it,
Or we can talk on the phone.
Is that what you sleep in now?
What do you want?Im exhausted!
I waited for you at the hotel.
- Why didnt you come?Are you mad at me? - No.
Roger, I cant do this anymore.
You always say that.
- Then you come back to me becausewe belong together. - Dont do that.
I need you right now.
Because Im a port in a storm?
No. Because I feel likeshit and you care about me.
Im not a solutionto your problems.
Im another problem.
Are you serious?
I cant do this anymore.
Youll change your mind.Youll see.
Im sorry.
I just cant do this anymore.
So what are you trying to say?
Roger.
So that night we got mugged,
That was the last time?
Wish Id known that.
God, Id think this placewould be packed still.
Its 8:00.
Theres only so much we canpretend like were doing.
- Are you okay?- You want something?
Id rather eat, but thats me.
Im one over for the day.
See that?
I kissed you and it got quiet.
- Howd it go?- ?t was...
Miserable.
Clients are running scared.
Im used to havingmy ideas rejected, not me.
How do you do it?
My job is to present facts.
If theyre unhappy with theagency, its not my problem.
Whos unhappy?
Come on.Clients are always unhappy.


Like who?
- Are you kidding?- No.
Why?Im drowning here.
You know I cant do that.
If a client is unhappy,theyre unhappy.
Theres nothing against tellingthem to have dinner with me.
If you dont want to, tell me who they are.Ill callem out of the blue.
I cant do that.
Sure you can.Wholl know?
The standard of ethics thisbusiness is low enough.
God knows Ive donesome things Im not proud of,
But those otheragencies pay me.
What about protectingthe clients?
So Im gonna k*ll mybusiness to save yours?
Its not your business.Its Athertons. This is different.
- This is everything to me.- ? dont believe this.
You want a shoulderto cry on, fine.
You want to throw me to the wolves soyou can save your neck, forget it.
- ? would do it for you.- ? would never ask.
I would never use you like that
Because I know the difference
Between what we haveand this stupid office.
Mr.Cosgrove says Playtex just left the hotel.
Thank you.
God, Im so nervous.
You need to relax.
I cant do this drunk.
I know a technique
That can really takethe nerves away.
I learned it from a yogi.
- Show me.- Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath.
Fill your lungsuntil you cant anymore.
Stick out your stomach.
Now release it in a coolstream right in my face.
Hey!What are you doing?
You said you wantedto relax, so...
- Lets relax.- Stan, no.
Oh, come on. Youre so horny Ican smell it on your breath.
Stan, knock it off.
Hey, I saw you withthe delivery boy yesterday.
What?Hes my boyfriend.
Oh, come on, baby.Its the end of the world.
Why do you keepmaking me reject you?
I was trying to do you a favor.
Well, thank you.Im not anxious anymore.
- Should I get the door? - No.It didnt get any worse.
What exactly did he say?
He said they were terrifiedabout the British
Banning cigarette ads from TVand they need to cut costs.
Maybe its a good timeto get out of this business.
Thats crap.Sales were up 10%.
You do what you can do.
David Montgomerys memorialis in 40 minutes
- At the River club.- David Montgomery died?
Well, theresyour silver lining.
Who the hellwants to go to that?
Were trying to getnew accounts.
- Remember how to do that?- You wanna dogpile on me?
Saving that accountwas impossible.
Because you ignored it!
One damn accountand you ignored it.
You dont know what youre talking about.Pete, explain it to him.
You squeezed meoff of it, Roger.
You wanted it all to yourself.
He would have neverlet this happen.
But you do what you cando which is nothing.
Hey. Youre the one who draggedme into your amateur hour.
I was perfectly happywhere I was.
Why did I do it?Out of friendship.
But now that the accounts gone,I guess that went with it.
Get out of here, all of you.Go Chase a hearse.
Sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Campbell,your father-in-law called.
Your wife and your daughterare resting comfortably.
Oh.Just now?
Yes, it happened.Youve got a baby girl.
- Congratulations.- Good job.
Thank you, Megan.
- Okay, we should get going.- Let me get my coat.
Where does draper get off?
Lee garner Jr.Never took you seriously
Because you nevertook yourself seriously.
- Are you ready?- Mmm.
No hard feelings?
None at all.
Everything good?
Absolutely.
And so I thinkabout that night...
Staring out the windowof that Detroit hotel room,
Knowing we weregoing home with Buick
And saying to David,
"is this the best thingwere ever going to do?"
Lynn, it wasyour fifth birthday.
The next day when wewere in the airport,
He showed me this pendant hedbought the day before downtown.
As he closed the box, he said,
"Crosby, thats the bestthing Ill ever do."
I know its hard,
But Dave loved you morethan anything, sweetheart.
Thats StuCarlsbad from Ralston Purina.
Hes always ripe.
We have dog food experience.
Ive got him.
I dont knowhow prepared I am,
But Dave was alwaysa fan of winging it.
Beth, his beautiful wife.
You were therebefore he made partner
And then you gave him to us,
But you knowyou and Lynnie
Were alwayson his mind.
True story.
Wed been in Londonfor three months
Trying to nail downBritish petroleum.
Never happened.
But once a week he woulddrag me to Portobello road
Looking for thimblesfor your collection, Lynn.
Silver thimbles.
And he was an expert.
Its because Playtexis strong enough
To protect a womans hands.
Through her fingertips, shecan dry the tears of a child
Or feel the warmthof her husbands skin.
Playtex protectsa womans touch.
Its very romantic.I have to admit
When you first brought it up, I didntthink that was possible for latex gloves.
These images areabout the moments
After the houseworkis over.
Theyre aboutthe meaningful life
A woman leadswhen work is done.
Well, I feel prettygood about this.
Peggy, our pleasure.
Were thrilled to get thisin the first try.
Well, Im gonna let youget back to the hotel
And then steaks and a show.
That went well.
You have lipstickall over your teeth.
What?
- Why are you still here?- ? didnt know if I should leave or not.
- How was the funeral?- Well see.
Get me the campaign briefson Kens accounts
And then you can go.
And send Peggy in.
Miss Olsons gone r the night,
- But if you need help...- Did you do that?
I thought in the end youwouldnt want to throw it away.
Youre wrong.
That commercial was great
And nothing they docan change that.
Ill take those.
Thank you.You can go.
You sure you dontwant some help?
This is a little complicated.
Thats okay. Id really liketo learn what goes on here.
Really.
Well, first of all,I think it would help me
From making mistakes withyour work the way I have.
And secondly,
I think Id like eventuallyto do what you do
Or what miss Olson does.
- ? didnt know that.- Unless youd rather be alone.
I dont want to be in the way.
No.I dont mind.
This is a strategy statement
Signed by Fillmore auto parts.
Copywriters stray fromthese midstream sometimes
If they have a better idea,
But we cant takethat chance now.
Wouldnt clientswant a better idea?
Whatd you likeabout the commercial?
Youre putting meon the spot. Um...
I know its a floor wax, but Ireally remember that feeling
Of being a little kid
And feeling like I was being punishedwhen my mother cleaned the house.
- Where are you from?- Montreal.
We didnt have glo-coat.
- Whyd you move here?- Well, first of all, its New York.
For an artist, its mecca.
Youre an artist?
I wouldnt say Im an artist.
Im an artistic person.I majored in literature
And Ive dabbledin writing and painting
And a little bit of acting.
What are you laughing about?
Because I just realized
I know everything about you.
I mean, youre inmy head all day,
Even when I go home.And you dont know anything about me.
Well, you haventbeen here that long.
And you dont knowhow long I will be,
So why get to know me?
I can see thats whateverybody must think.
You judge people on their work.
Im the same way.
Everything else is sentimental.
- You want one?- How many is that?
Four.
I know youre angry, butI hope youre not afraid
Because you willget through this.
You dont know that.
Why do you care what I think?
Megan, I dont thinkthis is a good idea.
This has nothingto do with work.
I cant makeany mistakes right now.
Lets be clear.
Im not gonna run out ofhere crying tomorrow.
I just want you right now.
Hey.Where are you going?
Im exhausted.
How was your day?
Fine.
I know how to make it better.
Im really tired.
Sit down.
Whatd you buy?
Look.
Look at it.
Sign it.
"to my loving wife."
Im so proud of you.
You should go first.Actually, I should go first.
Do you want to grab a bite?
I want you to go home
And I want you to sleep.
And I dont want youdrinking any more tonight.
Wait. Did you wantto go first?
Good night, Mr. Draper.
Didnt expect to see you here.
I was gonna call,
But I didnt wantto do this over the phone.
So you were gonna write iton an envelope.
Can I come inside?
I got you a meeting with Heinz.
Its vinegar, sauces and beans.
Theyre at Ketchum Macleodand theyre restless.
- Faye.- ? thought about what you said,
I thought about you...
And I thought about... whatever.You are my life right now.
You didnt have to do this.
I wanted to.
Thank you.
Youre welcome.
Do you wanna stay?
Ill probablyfall asleep on you.
Just sit with me.
 welcome to my world
 wont you come on in?
 miracles, I guess
 still happen now and then
 step into my heart
