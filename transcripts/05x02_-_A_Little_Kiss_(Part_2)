( theme music playing )
( Chanting )O-wee-o, o-wee-o.
We got the poverty,where is the dough?
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.
We got the poverty,where is the dough?
Shut up!
- Get a job!- Somebody call the cops.
Thats all there is--cops and negroes and priests.
( Chanting continues )
Youre walking in a circle.
Must be hot out there.
What are you doing?
- ( Horns honking )- ( Chanting continues )
You hit one.
Hey, watch the work.
- ( Laughing )- To the mens room.
Crowd:Less promises, more money!
Less promises, more money!
Do you know somebodys throwingwater b*mb out your windows?
What are you talking about?
Everybody saw it wascoming from this floor.
We all saw it.
Is this what MadisonAvenue represents?
( Laughing )
And they call us savages.
( Music playing )
What are you doing up?
I thought thiswas the bathroom.
Its down there.
Okay.
You want breakfast?
( Bacon sizzling )
Happy Birthday.
Oh, thank you.
We should wait for his cake.
Were not gonna be hereon his actual birthday.
Thank you.
Its from all of us.
Well go to the deli for dinnertonight and have cherry cheesecake.
- Open it now.- Yes, maam.
- Can I turn the bacon?- No.
I love it.
Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning.
- Hi, Megan.- Hi.
Thats so nice.
He needs one of those.
Its a badger--from its tail.
- What are we doing today?- Were going to the Statue of Liberty.
You always say that,but we never do.
( Sighs ) You hungry?
Just black coffee for me.
Okay, everybody.
Have a Happy Birthday.
Thank you, Sals.
How old are you gonna be?
  .
So when youre   ,how old will I be?
Youll be dead.

No. But give Morticiaand Lurch my love.
Flick the porch lightwhen you get there, all right?
- All right.- Good night, animals.
Say good night, honey.
Good night, daddy.
Get your brothers hand.
Bye.
Youre losing your head there.
Dandruff.
Its spit-up.
I saw your wifedropping you off.
Such a sweet scene.
Yes.
She has quite a smile.
Shes getting back to herself.
How olds the kid?
I thought it would bea little faster.
Does she cry all the time?
No.
She just...
There was a time when she wouldntleave the house in a robe.
Listen, theres a point
when you go from going homeon the  :   to the  :  .
If you finallylearn how to drive,
you can push it to  :  .
Youre gettingthe wrong impression.
Or not come home at all.
Beth and I got into itso bad the other night,
I just jumped in the carand drove.
Made it all the way tosome motel in Rocky Hill.
Put my fist through a wall.
Howard, dont getemotional again.
Maybe shes right.
Maybe I am a little selfish.
I said I needed timewith my thoughts.
She asked me whatI do at work all day.
They dont understand.
Conductor:Greenwich.
Next stop, Greenwich,Port Chester, Rye...
Who am I kidding?Its nothing a little peace wouldnt fix.
There you go.
Morning.
Of course.Ill let him know.
- Was that for me?- No.
- Who was it?- Really?
Fine.Whats Don up to today?
I see a lot of nappingand pillow talk.
Thats your schedule.
You all had the statusmeeting   minutes ago.
Cant you sit over thereonce in a while?
What if I have someoneimportant coming in?
When you have somebody comein, I will sit over there.
Here, why dont youbuy yourself
a fancy hat or a maskor something?
No, thank you.
All Im asking foris a few hours a day
where the world might mistakeyou for my secretary.
Joan said you weresupposed to share.
- And his phone rings more.- Joans not here.
And you just took $  from me.
( Phone ringing )
Let your consciencebe your guide.
( Coos )
That feels good.
That feels so much better.
Yeah.
I was right.Somebody was very wet.
When you were that size, Iused to change you every hour
whether you needed it or not.
I dont know how many timesI have to say this.
Those go in the cabinetin the hallway.
Im sorry.
I thought itd be easier ifthey were near your bathroom.
I didnt mean it that way.
I havent slept.
And I just feelcooped up in here.
I think its bad forKevin to be out there
until Im done cleaningthe oven-- the fumes.
I dont know why you had todo that on a hot summer day.
Anyway, I think were aboutto run out of formula.
Hello.
Hello, you.Youre gonna take a nap.
Would you like that?You want to lay in the bed with mommy?
A   ?
You buying hisformula or yours?
Ill take him for a walk.
Oh, God, would you?
Youre gonna gowith Grandma Gail.
Thats where youre gonna go.
( Fussing )
Close the door.
How was everybodys weekend?
Great. We all wentwater-skiing together.
- Made a human pyramid.- I was here.
Splendid. So I trust youre adequatelyprepared for the Heinz presentation.
Yes, boss.We have almost everything.
Mm-hmm. Just shortMrs. Drapers work.
- Shes writing the coupons.- Has Don signed off?
Hes late.And so is she, coincidentally.
Clara.
Clara!
She should have justrolled over and said,
"Don, what do youthink of this?"
I bet she says thatevery morning.
( Laughing )
Come on, its   :  .
- ( Laughing )- No sunbathing?
No.
Look, we hada three-day weekend
and you didnt do anything?
Thats not my calendar.
Pete:Clara.
- How was your weekend?- Clara, is Mr. Draper in yet?
- No.- Youre late for the status meeting.
You should probably go prepareinstead of molesting my secretary.
Well, sweetheart,the tortures over.
Let the fun begin.
My office is   yards away.
So when I hit that buzzer,Im trying to save myself
a trip through the miracleof telephonics.
Mr. and Mrs. Draperare here.
- Good morning.- Megan: So sorry. I overslept.
Thats not true.I did.
How was Memorial Day?
It was nice.We had my kids.
You had the statusmeeting at   :  .
- Morning.- Good morning.
( Chuckles ) Did you read aboutY&Rs paper bag drop?
I did.
- I dont see the humor.- Its funny.
I mean, if nothing else, it servesthem right for stealing Ponds.
What does one thinghave to do with the other?
They stole the Ponds accountand now theyre a laughingstock.
- Makes me feel better.- Gentlemen.
Shall we mosey on overto the conference room?
- We did have a meeting at   :  .- Morning, Lane, clipboard.
We should run a want adsaying something like,
"Sterling Cooper, an equalopportunity employer."
- Our windows dont open.- ( Laughs )
As tempting as it sounds,I dont know if we need to be
spending money to furthertheir embarrassment.
Look, if theres no line itemfor humiliating the competition,
Don will write itand Ill pay for it.
But youre notallowed to read it.
Forget the want ads.The advertising column.
- I want them to see it.- ( Laughs )
So, Heinz is coming in.Don?
Yes. Caroline, can you get Meganand the Heinz boards, please?
- Do you want the team?- No.
- What else?- Status is status quo on my end.
Im supposed to have drinks withBruce Lewis from oldsmobile.
He wants to know if theresa way around nader.
There isnt.Anything else?
Lane?
I have a lunch at the  As,
so I should be back in time butnot necessarily conscious.
And according to the memo,Kenny finally has signatures
from Chevalier, Galoneand Butler Shoes.
Footwear.All good news.
I suppose that bringsthis meeting to a close.
Don, may I speakwith you privately?
Uh, I should take a lookat these right away.
Mr. Campbell.
I have a call of nature.
Do not begin this meetingwithout me.
When is he free next?
You obviously havent seenmy coupons yet.
- Lets get out of here.- No.
Then lock the door.
As soon as Im in herelonger than five minutes,
people will start to...
What?Who?
I have to get these to Peggy.
You have a presentation,you know.
I could make you go home right now,you know. I have that power.
( Intercom buzzes )
Caroline: Mr. Campbellis here to see you.
- I just saw him.- I have to get back to work.
Open your blouse.
Youre a dirty old man.
- Anything else?- No, maam.
Im sorry.Am I interrupting?
I asked for your firstavailable meeting,
and it turns out you havenothing to do today.
If you could have any client inthe world, who would you want?
- American Airlines.- Why?
- Because they stood us up.- Right.
So I started thinking, who hasthose feelings about us?
Mohawk Airlines.
You were very close.
The companys ina lot of trouble.
Its very nice that things have notgone well since we cut them loose.
They want to come back?
After the waywe treated them...
So that American Airlinesthing isnt happening?
- I, for one, am very excited.- Oh, me, too.
I just dont understandthe secrecy or the urgency.
Im meeting with them today, andI think you should drop by.
Hank Lammott hit me prettyhard on his way out the door.
I may not help.
Don, youre the big draw.
Theyre not going to askfor someone else.
Look, get through this,get them back for more,
and Ill make timein my busy schedule.
Got it. Ill let you knowwhen I need you to...
Its a good idea.
Can I get some coffee?
Peggy: Oh, Megan,youre here.
I took a risk on one of them.Two for   ¢.
Nice.
Of course, were reallylocked into the  ¢ off,
but good thinking.
Stan, can you dosomething to these?
Like what?
I dont know.Do that thing with the border
around the edge so it kindof looks like legal tender
with the can of beanswhere Washington goes.
You want me to puta little wig on him?
Play with it.
Drop dead.
They keep asking me to bemore and more specific
until youredrawing it yourself.
- Do you want me to move?- Oh, no, no.
- Im just looking for gum.- Oh, I have some.
So I have to ask youropinion about something.
You did a great job,
but I cant really gooverboard on coupons.
I did that kindof baloney for two years.
You should take comfortin the fact that
its very important tothe client-- too important.
No, its something else.
Tomorrows Dons birthday.
Oh, shit.Its June  st?
Ugh, I forgot.
Got to get him something.
I still havent gottenyou a wedding present.
Sorry. You knowhow busy Ive been.
No, its just, um...
Im throwing a partyfor him on Saturday.
Its a surprise.
Oh, okay.
For Don?
Yes.
Men hate surprises.
Didnt you have"Lucy" in Canada?
Look, nobody likes itin theory,
but people are always glad.
And youve neverseen me throw a party.
Everyones gonna home from thisand theyre gonna have sex.
Okay.
Sounds like funfor us at least.
I mean, if Im invited.
I dont want to assume.
Youre invited.Im not sure who else is.
I went through his rolodex.I crossed out all the clients
and everyone hes fired.
That doesnt leavea lot of people.
Freddy Rumsen doesntcome to parties.
- You have to invite Harry.- I know,
but he really doesnt like him.
Really?
I didnt say anything.
( Laughs )
- Frank Keller, his accountant?- He likes him.
There are six phone numbersfor Herman Phillips.
- Is he important?- Thats Duck.
What birthday is it?
( Mouths )   .
( Keys jingling )
( Door opens )
( Quietly ) Howd he do?
He was fussy the whole time.
But the elevatoralways knocks him out.
Must be the vibration.
Who would have thoughtyoud be so good at this?
Youll be good at it,too, sweetheart.
What am I going to dowhen you go home?
Are you really goingback to that office?
You worked.
I had to.Your husbands a doctor.
It doesnt matter.I promised and they need me.
Im not saying yourenot important to them,
but they also knowthat priorities change.
- They should, anyway.- Why are you doing this?
You dont know how sick youre going tofeel inside or what youre going to miss.
What hes doing now,thats nothing.
- Just wait.- I know, I know.
I just--
I dont wantto break my promise.
And Greg will be stationed atFort Dix for a second year.
- I can commute from New Jersey.- And then?
And then when hes done,
well see.
Joan, hes not going toallow you to work.
Allow me?
Whither thou goest, I will go.
And how did thatwork out for you?
( People chatting )
Ah, Pete Campbell.Late as usual.
He obviously didntcome in on a Mohawk plane.
- Hank. Jack.- Youre not late.
- Roger told us to come early.- Hmm.
Have a seat. Youre only onebehind, but theyre nuclear.
Roger, theyre lookingfor you back in the office.
- Itll keep.- We were just laughing about Y&R.
It couldnt have happenedto a better bunch of bigots.
( Laughs )
Roger, its an emergency.
Really?
Oh, come on.We just got started.
All right, all right.Sorry, fellas.
Heavy is the headthat wears the crown.
You dont want me to flycopilot or be your wingman?
Check your valises?Hold your airsickness bag?
Do you want me to throw oneinto the bag youre in?
You enjoy yourself, then.
Garcon, assume thatthese are gone.
I should warn youabout these two--
- Theyre a thirsty lot.- Always a pleasure.
When youre done with him, just foldhim up and slide him under the door.
( Laughs )
I love that guy.
And so we take advantage ofthis new microphotography
and high-speed camerato show...
A bean ballet.
( Humming )
Spinning in air with theirdelicious perfection,
the beans pirouettein slow motion,
they somersault in slow motion.
Some of them spin clockwise,some counter-clockwise
so theyll appear to bemoving towards each other.
Until...
They drop into a full canfirst seen from the top.
Theres a splash ofmouth-watering sauce
as each one lands.
Then we cut to the front,the iconic label.
( Stops humming )
"The art of supper."
Have you done this before,this special photography?
Its been done before, butyoull be the first on TV.
How do they get the beans to do that?They cant just get lucky.
This camera can showa b*llet spinning in midair.
Wheres the bite and smile?
Ken, you said thered bea bite and smile on the phone.
I think I said there was gonnabe a bean ballet, Raymond.
But Im sure we can add that.
And what do theytake away from it?
It puts beans on their mind.
Its an unforgettable image.
And believe it or not,it makes them exciting.
And itll show you havea sense of humor,
because, really,theyre being portrayed
as far more importantthan they are.
You ever see beans up close
theyre slimy. They look likea bunch of bloody organs.
And its not just for fellas likeme that saw things in Korea.
Kidney beans arecalled kidney beans
because theyreshaped that way.
But you could callall beans that.
They look betterin a group, in a bowl.
Hell, whats wrongwith a spoon?
Don.
- Well, hello, Don.- Hello, Raymond.
Good to see you.Are you as excited about this as we are?
I dont know.
You said to be bold.
Nothing on TV is goingto look like this.
And just imagine seeingone of these dancing beans
on the subway wall.
People will hear the musicin their heads.
Look, its very artistic.
And I want to be bold,but this isnt what I had in mind
when I was talking about anew generation of consumers.
The ketchup kids,are they even going to notice this?
I mean, that waltz alonereminds me of old people.
Maybe I wasnt clear.
This is temporary music.We can change it.
Its got no message.
I can see your point.
Beans is the w*r,the depression,
b*mb shelters.We have to erase that.
They have to be cool.Don, you know what Im talking about.
I want the kids in college.
Its convenient.
They have the hot plate.Theyre sitting in.
Okay.Well work on that.
Maybe its someone witha picket sign saying,
- "We want beans."- You know what, Raymond?
This is our job from here on out.Well make you happy.
Raymond: Im really sorryabout that.
Please, this is a process.
Let me walk you out.
What else you got?
That was the best thing so far.
Unless you likethis beans protest.
Please, you cant besurprised that that man
- doesnt have a taste for ballet.- Its a joke on ballet.
And you cant be surprised hedoesnt have a sense of humor.
Im not.
But I guess I thoughtyoud come in here
and tell them how good it was.
Do I really want to waste an hourand a half shoving it down his throat
only to have him pullthe plug at the last minute?
This is business thatcame in over the transom.
We didnt pitch it.He has every right to make us work for it.
I wish I would have known that.
I would have saved thisfor round two.
Well get him next time.
( Phone ringing )
Caroline.Is he in?
Hes gone for the day.
Ha!
Ah! Oh!
Damn it.Clara.
Clara!
Oh, my goodness.What happened?
- You want me to get some tissue?- No.
I want you to tell me whyRoger Sterling was at my meeting.
- I dont know.- I know.
Because he hovers overyour desk like a damn U- .
- What?- You think hes looking at your breasts?
Hes looking at my calendar.
Did she hit you?
Thank you, Clara.Youve done enough damage for today.
You need to lower your voice.Have a drink.
No, no more drinks.
- Heinz looked miserable.- Theyre making us work for it.
Don didnt seem worried.Did you crash with Mohawk?
No, it was perfect.
Except for my deep nauseaand pending headache.
Oh, and Roger madean appearance.
( Chuckles ) Well, that showsits a good lead.
Its my lead.
Wasnt Roger in the servicewith Henry Lammott?
Did you do any rowing?
- You rowed?- I was a coxswain.
The boat moved because everyonepulls in the same direction.
Im not supposed to worryabout Roger.
Im supposed to worryabout other agencies.
You shouldnt be worried at all.Business is stable.
Stable is that step backwards
between successful and failing.
Fine, Pete.
Just dont be impatient.
You know how this worksfrom here on out.
We start with a bunchof piddly shit.
Your topaz,your white knight cologne.
We add your mid-sized stuff.Maybe Mohawk.
We still got Vicks.Thats big.
Next, we worm our wayinto a few niche companies,
get something sexy in a goodneighborhood, a pharmaceutical.
Maybe if Godis gracious, a car.
And then we go public,
open an office in Buenos Aires,
and Elvis playsat Tammys Sweet   .
Kenny Cosgrove writes anothergreat American novel.
You know it didnt hurtto have Roger warm them up.
Theres no one betterat turning a meeting into a bender.
And they love his pickled guts.
Am I going to see youat Chez Draper on Saturday?
I wish I could getovertime for it.
( Chuckles )
You ready?
- Were almost done, actually.- Do you need her?
No, its okay.Itll be here in the morning.
- Great.- Big weekend plans?
Its Tuesday.I dont know.
I was talking about me.
My cousins coming in.
Stan, assume thatyoure working.
Good night.
Youre amazing.
It could have been worse.
I almost said, "Im sorryI cant make it."
- Youre not going?- No, my cousins on shore leave.
Hes only got two days.A little notice would have been nice.
I would have lovedto have seen the look on Dons face.
You almost just saw it.
Like we have nothingelse to do.
Did you believe him in there?
The guy didnt like it.What was he supposed to say?
What he usually says.
"Hey, buddy, you got such greatideas, open your own agency."
The clients are rightall of a sudden?
I dont recognize that man.
Hes kind and patient.
And it galls you.
No, it concerns me.
( Groans )
Where are you going?
Ive got ticketsto the bean ballet
and the curtainsabout to go up.
Never gets old.
( Laughs )
Youre home late.
I thought I was going to haveto walk home from the station,
but luckily there wasa cab driver leaving a bar.
How was your day?
I didnt want to disturb you.
Oh.
This becomes a home the minuteyou walk through that door.
( Sighs )
Theres no fruitto my labor, tweety.
Well, I supposenone of this counts--
An acre of land,a wife, a child.
That has nothingto do with work.
Im ungrateful.
Im sorry.
Dissatisfactionis a symptom of ambition.
Its the coal that fuels the fire.You know that.
( Sighs )
Do you really want a dog?
Maybe just a beagleto scare off gophers.
Well see.
Oh, luckily my parentscan baby-sit Saturday.
Now tell me the truth.Did Megan really just invite you today?
She did.I dont know about everyone else.
Well, shes very impulsive.We know that.
I have to go to bed.Tammy will be up in a hour.
Go ahead.
( Chatting, laughing )
Attention, party guests.
- Hello.- ( Chatter stops )
Were T-minusfive minutes or so.
So if we can bring thingsdown to a sotto voce,
that would help.
Im gonna turn off the lights.
- No!- ( Guests laugh )
Well, fine.Just keep it down.
My God, is he q*eer.
He reminds meof Lanes brother.
( Laughs )
( Elevator opens )
Ah!
Finally.
Were gonna goinside in a second.
Youre the one that draggedme out to the restaurant.
Come on.
- ( Whistles )- ( Sighs )
Jane:You have to knock.
- You have to knock to get in.- What if its started already?
It doesnt matter if its started,you still have to knock.
No.
We were just inthe neighborhood.
And my mother always saidnever show up empty-handed.
Oh, damn it.
- No.- ( Sighs )
Calice.
All:Surprise!
( Applause ) Sorry, I blew it in the hall.
All:Aw!
But I am very surprised.
( Applause )
( Band playing )
I have to say that I am honored
and touched to be includedin this group of intimates.
And I predicted this,did I not?
This.( Laughs )
( Grunts )
Who is this?
Oh, thats my wife.
- Nice to meet you.- Charmed.
The domino theoryis not a joke.
The Vietnameseare fighting a civil w*r.
There is no monolithiccommunism.
- Its an excuse.- Really?
Come on, Bert.Its for profit.
b*mb are the perfect product.
They cost a fortuneand you only use them once.
So I suppose this young man here iscoming home in a bag for nothing.
If hes lucky.You ever read "Johnny got his g*n"?
No eyes, no ears, no nose,
tapping out his lastwishes in morse code
with his deformed head.
I thought there wegoing to be girls here.
For purely selfish reasons, I wantto thank you for excluding Joan.
I would have had to buyearplugs for the ride home.
It wasnt up to me.Cant you tell?
( Laughing )
Hell of a party.Jennifer couldnt make it.
- Im sorry to hear that.- No, she couldnt get a date.
( Laughs )
Anyway, I knowshe said no gifts,
but I got you this.
Open it.
You dont have toif you dont want to.
Its a silver-handledwalking stick.
Oh, look, he got you a cane.
Don Ameche has one.Its a steinway walking stick.
You could stick it upyour ass and have a concert.
Thank you very much.
( Megan laughing )Oh, my God, really?
Harry:Oh, a n*gro homosexual,
a Canadian sexpotand unaccompanied redhead.
I think this may bemy key demographic.
Hello.
Dont.Just leave it alone.
I know. Youre wonderingwhat theyre laughing about.
Its not you.
Well, I for one thinkyoure very brave, Megan.
My mother always said
a woman should surpriseher husband every day.
Thats why they hadno lock on the WC.
Its true.
Look at you delivering drinks.
We should get youa pair of roller skates.
Roger, I didnt knowyou were invited.
Or did you just hearI was coming and show up?
- Is he going bald?- ( Chuckles )
( Laughs )
It just goes on and on.
Its beautiful,but its very loud.
Listen, you can hear thetraffic even over this party.
I know.
Who cares?I just want to take my pants off
and slide my asson the carpeting.
Hows the summer treating you?
Well, its been goodbecause its been bad.
- What do you do exactly?- Hes a journalist.
Underground papers mostly.
You may not have seen it.
And what exactly has been bad?
Well, I dont know.Four riots in three cities in two months.
It is terrible.
And lord knows the policearent much help.
I was raised sex, politics, andreligion arent party talk.
Well, what does that leave?
I dont know.Alcohol and work?
Mmm.
Hello again.
Trudes, which oneis Jane Sterling again?
Mm, the glamour pusswith the tan.
Marry early and often.
Were thinking about smoking sometea with Megans friends out there.
Will you keepan eye out for Don?
As long as yourejust thinking about it.
You should join us.
Kenny gets braveand recites poems.
And she thinks theyre good.
Oh, absolutely.
Megan was the bestwaitress they ever had.
No, but I did getthe best tips.
- How did you manage that?- She laid on that accent.
You know, shesa really good actress.
Not good enough, obviously.
- Man: Julia, come here for a second.- Hello there.
Hello.
- Glad you could come.- Great party.
You got a great spread here.
I just wanted tomake sure we said hi.
I cant stay that long.I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.
But I guess you know that.
Come on, Don.
What are you doing?
Was that bad?
Hell, look who youre talking to.How do I know?
Okay, everyone.
- My friends.- ( Band stops playing )
First of all, I wanted tothank you all for coming.
And second of all,
I think Ive hadjust enough to drink
that Im ready to give my ownpresent to the birthday boy.
All:Oooh!
Thank you.Thank you all for coming.
I think we shouldcall it a night.
Absolutely not, Don.
You stay there.
- Did you buy him a pony?- ( Laughing )
Un, deux, trois, quatre.
( Band playing )
( Singing in French )
Oui, oui!Oui!
( Guests cheer )
( Song ends )
Happy Birthday, baby.
( Cheering, whistling )
Why dont you sing like that?
Why dont you look like him?
( Clinking )
- Je mappelle Roger.- ( Guests laugh )
- If I may raise a glass.- Happy Birthday, Don!
( Chuckles )As I was saying--
to Megan
for letting us seethe Don Draper smile
usually reserved for clients.
Hear, hear!
And to Don,you lucky so and so.
As a wise man once said,the only thing worse
than not getting what you wantis someone else getting it.
Okay, now, no one hascalled and complained,
so theres no reasoneveryone shouldnt dance.
( Band playing )
I should probably clean up.
Leave it for the girl.
She doesnt come till Monday.
Call her and haveher come tomorrow.
And Monday.
Problem solved.
Did you have fun?
Move over.
No, I just want to sleep.
Oh, come on.I know you had a good time.
I can see it.
I dont want to talk.I just want to go to sleep.
Hey.
( Sighs )
Dont waste moneyon things like that.
It was my money
and you dont get todecide what I do with it.
Well, cod you please notuse it to embarrass me again?
What?
I know why youre upset.
Youre   .
Ive been   for half a year.
This is your birthday now.
Fine, I dont like my birthday.
I told you, I never had itwhen I was growing up
and Ive never wanted it since.
You never had a birthday?
Didnt Betty everthrow you a party?
No, because I forbid it.
( Laughs ) Why?
I dont need to bethe center of attention.
You love attention.
You twitched every timeI talked to another person.
( Sighs )
More people feel the wayI do than the way you do.
Wheres your research?
Fine, Im   .

Aw.
Nobody loves Dick Whitman.
I love you.
Thats why I threw you a party.
Im going to sleep.
You can do what you want.

Thats me.
You know what?You do what you got to do, mister.
Oh, thats for you.
Man on TV:High tides and heavy surf
battered the coastof North Carolina day.
Force   winds and heavyrain forced evacuation
along the coastas far inland as three miles.
That was quite a soiree.
Did Masters and Johnsoncome in yet?
They havent passed by.
I should come and sit down,
so I can see themslink in in shame.
You seem to be in fine spirits.
Well, I didnt get intotoo much trouble on Saturday.
Plus, Mohawk called meat home this morning.
Ah.
- ( Intercom buzzes )- I hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,
but I have your wife.
- Which line?- Three.
- Its blinking.- Theyre all blinking.
- Three.- If you dont mind.
Ive calleda partners meeting.
Hello, dearest.
Look, I know you wereupset when you left,
and perhaps Im overreacting.
Becca, dear,
this is why I dont likeyou opening the mail.
I only want to ensure thatNigel is enrolled in the fall.
Nigels enrollmentisnt an issue
whether we pay now or not.
Then why would they attach sucha threatening letter to a bill?
Wouldnt you rather have your money inJune than September if you were them?
Well, I worry about themsaving his spot for him,
especially with his marks.
I assure you thatSt. Pauls is aware
that we plan onhaving him return
and simply wishes to earnwhatever interest they can
on the full amountfor the next three months.
Couldnt you sparethat interest
in exchangefor my peace of mind?
Lane, darling?
What? Im sorry.I didnt get that last bit.
Nothing.Dont forget
to get the name ofMegans real estate agent.
Yes, dear.
And her decorator.
( Gail laughing )
Oh, Apolo,youre so good with him.
Oh, I wasnt expectingyou back so soon.
First in lineat the post office.
- It wasnt that bad.- Hello, Miss Joan.
Sink is draining.
Turns out it was a lemon peel.
Im sure you knowwere appreciative,
but mother and Ihave so much to do.
I am busy, busy, too.
Oh, you dont have to rush off.
He doesnt have torush off, does he?
When you need Apolo,you call Apolo.
( Chuckles )
I want him to hear--
That was just rude.
It is one thingto have him work here,
it is another thing to givehim cake and my baby.
His fingers have been in everytoilet from here to the bowery.
He brought the cookies.
If you want to go ona date with him, just ask.
Hes marriedwith four children.
Im just making sure thisapartment gets his attention.
This apartment has never had anytrouble getting his attention.
Yes, Joanie.Everyones staring at you.
You know youre not exactlyat your fighting weight.
Try me.
You asked me to come out here.
You can go homeany time you want.
You should thinkbefore you say that.
I got my moneys worth.
Well, I wasnt goingto show you this.
That doesnt make any sense.
Look, Im sure its not the wayanyone wants you to find out.
No, its not in the want ads.
And, honestly, they dont havethe money for more people.
Its not more people.Its you.
You love stirring the shit.
I am telling you somethingyou dont want to hear.
And you are making thisvery painful for me.
Megan Draper just invitedme to her party.
At the very last minute.
Dont tell me thatgirls not conniving.
You think she wants youaround her husband?
Im going to lie down.
Sometimes life makesdecisions for you.
- Have a good day.- Okay.
- Bonjour.- I know your birthday was last week,
and I was told you dont celebrateit and not to bring it up.
Now I feel like I gotcaught with my pants down,
so I got youa little something.
Its a plant.
I just wanted to sayHappy Birthday.
Kiss-ass.
Thank you.
( Singing in French )
I can get you some coffee, buttheres a partners meeting.
- Nobodys there.- Its in Mr. Campbells office.
- You want to smile?- Is it your obituary?
No, its the little saltwe rubbed in Y&Rs wound.
- Its beautiful, no?- ( Phone ringing )
- Thats Mr. Campbell.- Shall we?
- Roger.- What?
We dont make fun of eachothers wives here. Understood?
( Chuckles ) Come on, Iwasnt making fun of her.
I was making fun of you.Youre happy.
- I am.- Well, I want you to be happy.
Somebody should be.
You know, two weeks ago,
Jane asked me,"Which ones Mussolini?"
( Both laugh )
No, its good.Shes a great girl.
Theyre all great girls.At least until they want something.
Lets go.
Theyre just leaving now.
What, did they stopfor a drink?
Well, why dont you get off your rear,find them, and tell them Im about--
Theyre here.
Gentlemen, if youcould slide over a bit.
- A marvelous fete.- Oh, yes.
I have instructions fromTrudy to thank both of you.
- Why are we meeting in here?- Why are we here?
Please dont smoke in here.I spent the morning choking on the train.
So, Mohawk is coming in.Ive brought them in.
- What do you know about that?- Thats great news.
- When?- I dont know.
All I was thinking is that Ibring Henry and Jack in here
to this very gathering of individuals,but I have one question.
Where are they going to sit?
I mean, what kind of impressiondoes this space give you?
Do you gaze upon the cementcolumn and think,
"Yes, I believe successfor me and my company dwells here."
( Laughing ) Why dont you takethem to the conference room?
Because its not that meeting.
Fine, well have itin my office.
This does notinvolve you, Roger.
Nor does Vicks, Playtex,Life Cereal, Samsonite,
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.
Need I go on?
What are you suggesting?
Hes suggesting that yougive him your office.
( Chuckles ) No, hes not.
- Yes, I am.- Well, forget it.
Where am I supposedto conduct business?
In the crapper for all I care.
Im a full partnerand youre a junior.
So sorry, Charlie,but thems the breaks.
Gentlemen, Im sure we can findan equitable solution to this.
- Theres no need for a row.- Youre right.
I say we put it to a vote.
I say we step outside.
I didnt think so.
Good work on Mohawk.
Thank you, but Im deadserious about this.
I have too much responsibilityand too much business
to apply my k*llin this environment.
You all know it.


Well buy more space.
- If were handing out offices...- Absolutely not.
I cant extend ourcredit line any further.
Itll work itself out.
Congratulations.
When are they coming in?
Im still not sure they should,
considering the situation.
Great party, Don.
Absolutely.
I couldnt sleep.
Oh, those tits and that mouth.
Shes such a sex kitten.
That whole dance--How did he just sit there?
You cant stand up onceyou get in that condition.
I would have.I would just stood up
and grabbed her littleFrench behind
and pushed her through thosecheap post four walls.
- Hi, Megan.- Very funny.
God, what I would do to her.
Like what, for example?
Ill tell you what.
I would love to seethose heels on my shoulder.
Ooh, je voudrais mas Harry.
Good morning.
Great party.Thrilled to be included.
Jennifer was very jealous.
( Laughing )
I think Im gonna die.
- Oh!- You could have warned me!
I did!
( Intercom buzzes )
I have the owner of the walletreturning your call.
Thank you.
- Hello.- Woman: Hello, Mr. Pryce.
Im calling for Alex Polito.
- And who is this?- This is his girl Delores.
Oh.
Well, when he comesinto the office,
I think I should speakwith him personally.
Oh, Im not his secretary.Im his girl.
Im like his wife,but I cant call myself that.
Oh.
You dont soundhappy about that.
- Excuse me?- Im married myself.
Oh, good for you.Whats her name?
Rebecca.Rebecca Pryce.
Well, obviously.
- Thats a pretty name.- I suppose so.
She enjoys it.
Do you thinkshes home right now,
lying in bed,talking to a stranger?
Oh, I should hope not.
So-- so you haveAlexs wallet?
Yes, I do.
And where are you?
Im at my offices in midtown.
Oh, are you in big business?
Excuse me?
Are you in a bigoffice building?
Uh, yes.
Thats why I donthave the luxury
of lying around at   :in my underthings.
I didnt tell you that part.
You didnt sayI was incorrect, either.
Where the hell are you from?
You sound like Cary Grant.
I told you, midtown.
Why dont I--
Listen, I reallyshould return this--
You know, the wallet.
I could slip itin the post or...
Of course, you know,that has its disadvantages.
Theres a bit of cash here.
Or I couldhand-deliver it.
Is this a current address?
I dont know.
I dont know if thatwould be proper.
No, of course.
Why dont you meet meat my place of business?
Ill give you the addressor have my secretary help you.
Yeah.Why dont we do that?
And Ill come by when I can.
Well, Ill be herethe rest of my life.
( Laughs )
Uh, just a minute.
I look forward to it.
Why not?
Toodle-loo.
Thats cute.
Scarlett, would you give thiswoman directions to our office?
Shes on line three.
- ( Intercom buzzes )- Mr. Crane.
Mr. Sterling has requestedyou in his office.
- Is there a meeting?- He just--
He just came over here,said he needed to see you
and walked away.
- Why didnt he come in?- I dont know.
He knows youre in there.
Okay. Okay. Did you see himtalking to Megan or Don?
Ive been working.What did you do?
Nothing!
You wanted to see me?
I did.
( Coughs )Come in, have a seat.
No, thats okay.
I think you should have a seat.
Okay.
Now, I think you know
that we like to thinkof this place as a family.
And there are certain waysa family behaves.
What did she say?You have to hear my side of it.
Your side of what?
What-- Nothing.
Youre always up to something,arent you, Crane?
It was an honest mistake and Iconsider myself reprimanded.
Great.
I was thinking Petecould take your office.
Really?
Look, I will apologizeface to face,
as horrible as that willbe, but I think youre--
Theres no reason to let me go.
Youre not getting fired.
- Oh.- And what the hell did you do?
I made fun of"Zou Bisou."
So did I.( Laughs )
Is that a crime?No.
I tried to get Jane totalk to me in that accent.
Nothing doing. She doesnt speak French.She doesnt like me.
I went home after and Jenniferdidnt know what was coming.
- I was like--- I dont want to hear that.
No, of course you dont.Why would you?
Look, I think you can understandthat Pete needs a bigger office.
And just between you,me, and the window washer,
its been decidedthat you should trade.
Who decided that?
- I did.- I cant do that.
And I dont know that Ihave to do it. Do I?
( Sighs )
Harry...
Im asking you as a friend.
And I appreciate that, Roger, Ireally do, but I need my office.
Look, first of all, Petesoffice isnt that different.
- I disagree.- Fine.
Name the most important person youcould bring into this office.
William Paley.
Okay, so you shouldnt do that.
Trust me, network andstudio executives
want to think youreout there jet-setting,
rubbing shoulderswith television stars
and chorus girls.
You should be talkingto clients ringside
or at a three-starrestaurant,
not coming into yourmiserable little office.
But I do.I come in here almost every day.
And Petes office is a shithole with a support beam.
What if I were tomake it worth your while?
Im already headof my department.
What would bean appropriate bonus?
Theres no bonuses.We have no money.
How much would it take?
Well, first of all, its morethan you could have on you.
Really?
Thats $ ,   .
Why do you carry so much cash?
Its more than  ,   , Harry.
That is a months salary
after taxes.
Theres no window in there.
You could buy yourselfa very beautiful picture
of something to look at.
Well, okay.
- But youre gonna owe me.- No, Im not.
I just gave you a lot of money.
This is a transaction.And if you dont like it,
we can have the conversationyou thought we were having.
So this is every month?
Get the hell out of my office.
Excuse me.Im sorry.
Im Joan.
Im Meredith.Can I help you?
Joan Harris.
I work here.
Worked here.Ive been on leave.
Oh, Joan.
My goodness.
Its hard to believeyou just had a baby.
You dont know where I started.
Do you want me to announce you?
No, Ill let myself in.
- Are you sure?- No one mentioned a new girl.
I guess they neededsomeone up here
because Scarlett is nowcovering Mr. Pryce,
so that she cando the books with Clara.
Well, now I can understandwhy I wasnt told.
Oh, my God.My mouth.
Could you justhelp me with the door?
Oh, hes adorable.
Please dont be mad at mefor telling you that.
Im very happybeing nobody here.
I know a girl who had your jobwho ended up with everything.
Where would you liketo visit first?
I suppose my office.
Yes, yes, absolutely.Joan.
My goodness, you look radiant.
- Can I see him?- I dont see why not.
- Wheres Scarlett?- Go fetch Caroline.
Joanie.
Look at you out and about.
Yes, were gonna stopby the Copa later.
One of us badly needs a drink.
Lane made it very clearwere not hiring anybody.
I dont care how buxomhis mother is.
Oh, Don.
- Look at that.- Hes okay.
Hello, Megan.
Oh, hello, Joan.
Im sure Im not ruiningany surprises at this point,
but how was your party?Im sorry I missed it.
Oh, hes adorable.
Are we welcoming you back?
- That was my impression.- Today?
- Do you want to hold him?- What?
Hes a little cabbage.
Mon petit chou.
Its just a matterof time, Don.
I should be gettingback to work.
Im gonna quit while Im ahead.
Joanie, Ill say what Isaid when you left here--
This is not a good excuse.
Nice to see you.
- When are you coming back?- I was planning on three weeks.
My mothers leaving any day,so I was gonna hire a girl.
Its gonna beterrible to leave him.
Joan.
I was wondering if youwere going to visit.
Oh, my hands are dirty.
Oh, my God.He looks just like you.
I should get back to work.I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.
Good.
So, how are you?
Roger:Well, well, well.
Theres my baby.
Now move that brat outof the way so I can see her.
Hello, Roger.
Little dud like my present?
Im sure youre aware
that a bicycles notuseful yet, Uncle Roger.
Oh, no?Hes a loafer?
Hes been keeping me awake.
He needs constant attention.
Is that right?Let me see that.
Has anyone even seen this babywith you walking next to him?
( Intercom buzzes )
Lane: Scarlett.Scarlett, may I see you?
I got it.
( High voice )Mr. Pryce,
Mrs. Harris is hereto see you.
- Oh, send her in.- Ive got him.
Caroline, I need you to makedinner reservations right away.
Ill be right back.
This really isan unexpected pleasure.
Just stopping by.
Anything I should know about?
Uh, yes, actually.Pressing business.
Would you mind?
No, not at all.
What are we supposedto do with him?
Better than the stepsof a church, I guess.
Have either of you seen Clara?
No.
Whats that?
Oh, its Joans little boy.
Oh, thats darling.
Would you please take himand give him back to Joan?
Do I suddenly appearto be wearing a skirt?
Spectacular party.
Just take him.You should say hello to Joan anyways.
Clara?
She looks very good.
She does.She looked good at nine months.
I dont know about that.
Im surprisedyou didnt tell her.
- Tell her what?- That she looked terrible.
You seem to saywhatevers on your mind.
Is something wrong?
No.
I got the vicks coupons done.
I know you thought you were theonly one working this weekend.
No, I didnt.
Really?Thats what you said to Don.
I know.
I just-- I had toomuch to drink and--
And you couldnt resistsaying something obnoxious?
Well, just so were clear,
I put in a lot of work on Heinz.So did you.
You cant even apologize.None of you can.
- Im sorry.- Youre sorry?
What is wrong with you people?
Youre all so cynical.You dont smile.
- You smirk.- Is he mad at me?
I dont care.
Who wouldnt wanta surprise party?
I dont feel well.
- Megan...- No, really, I dont-- I dont feel well.
Am I allowed to go home?
Of course.
Im so sorry.You were right.
I apologize.
Its fine.
Lane: Heinz wontsign off on the work.
So they wont be back infor   days,
which means we wont getpaid for another   .
And were aboutto sh**t Christmas ads
for Sugarberry and Vicks.
But they wont rununtil Christmas,
so we wont get paiduntil easter.
Well, that explains why youreasking me for all this free advice.
Oh, Im just tryingto get things in order.
So that you caneliminate my job?
What?Absolutely not.
- Then why did you run an ad?- What ad?
- In this mornings Times.- Oh, that.
That wasnt an ad.
Well, what the hellwas it, then?
It was some privateBarb directed at Y&R.
Mrs. Harris, the bookshave practically
been held togetherwith spit in your absence.
What about Scarlett and Clarasplitting my work?
Splitting?The two of them together
couldnt operate a parking meter.Theyre imbeciles.
Well, that wasa dumb thing to do.
Oh, there, there.
( Sobbing ) Im sorry.
Ive been like thissince the baby.
And its not him.
I just...
Keep thinking aboutwhats going on here
and I missed it too much.
Its too embarrassing.
Nothings happened.
Something always happens.Things are different.
Somebody tells a joke and you dontknow what theyre talking about.
There have been no jokes,not without you.
Not even at my expense?
Im terriblyadrift without you.
Its just a matter of timebefore they find out Im a sham.
( Sniffles )
Nobody came to visit me.
They sent flowerswith some stupid card
written by the florist.
There would have been a cake, butyou werent here to arrange it.
( Laughs )
Its just--
And I dont expect youto understand this--
but my husbandsbeen gone so long.
And I know hes cominghome soon.
And even with my babythere and my mother...
I feel alone.
Its home, butits not everything.
I do understand.
Now, I wont have everyonethinking Ive made you cry.
Well, at least tell meabout the party.
Mrs. Draper put ona bit of a burlesque.
- No.- Oh, yes.
She danced and sangin front of all of us.
She was quite the kickette.
( Laughs )
I cant do it justice.
And Don?
I saw his soul leave his body.
I cant even imagine
how handsome that manmust be blushing.
Yes.
( Knocking )
I dont know how I endedup with him, but...
Thank you so much.
Mr. Pryce, I willbe speaking with you.
Let me take a lookat him at least.
Handsome little blackheart.
- ( Chuckles )- ( Passes gas )
- Ah!- ( Laughs )
Oops.I think...
Have you seen Clara?
Clara: Congratulations.Were gonna be right next to each other finally.
Whats going on?
Clara, could you excuse us?
Well, she obviouslyalready knows.
Please.
Uh, Roger, you know,convinced me.
We all thought it was best for thefirm that you have a bigger office,
so I was asked to switch.
Ill be right back.
I appreciate your sacrifice,
but a bigger officewas not the point.
Well, fine, then.Ill switch back.
Roger didnt sayI couldnt switch back.
I dont care what Roger says.I am the head of accounts.
I am bringing in all the business.I deserve the bigger office.
Its a great office, Pete.
Its very important.
Its got the windows.God, Im gonna miss them.
And you did this becauseRoger told you to?
And also becauseI respect you so much.
What do you want me to say?
Look, I just need a placeto hide until Megan leaves.
Oh, God, unless she told Don.
Shes not gonnatell Don, is she?
I dont know whatyoure talking about.
- ( Knocks )- Come in.
Whats up?
At your party,which was lovely,
I said something whichI shouldnt have said.
And I want to apologize
if you had a badtime because of it.
I had a wonderful time.
Well, good.
The only reasonIm bringing it up
is Megan seemed kind of upset.
Im very sorry.I should not be allowed
to drink at work functions.Or at all, honestly.
- What did she say?- Nothing.
But she went home.She wasnt feeling well.
Im mortified if I hadsomething to do with it.
When did she leave?
I think she wants to be alone.
You dont know her at all.
Caroline.
Im done for the day.
- ( Intercom buzzes )- Mr. Pryce.
- Yes, Scarlett?- Theres a gentleman here,
the owner of the wallet--Mr. Polito.
Hes in reception.Shall I bring him back?
No, absolutely not.
Well, do you want to see him?
Yes, Ill be out in a moment.
Of course, Mr. Pryce.
Thank you, Delores.
- Excuse me?- I said just a minute.
Hello.
Are you Mr. Polito?
I am. Although theres noway for you to know that.
You got my wallet.
I contacted you.
Thank you.
Well, Im glad this worked out.
Hold on.
Just hold on a second.
Everythings there.
So it is.
Well, you cant blame me.
My horse came inand I lost my wallet.
Then it came in again.
- Here.- No, thats not necessary.
- Youve got to take a reward.- I couldnt possibly.
My girl saidyou were real polite.
Obviously from the accent,youre not from around here.
No, Im not.
This is the way we do things.
Thanks again.I mean it.
Youre a real gentleman.
Megan?Where are you?
Oh, youre home.
So are you.What happened?
Nothing.
You just left without me?
- I was upset.- Thats clear.
About what?
Because my apartment is filthy.
Wheres the girl?
I sent her home.
What are you doing?
Im cleaning up.I dont want to get sweaty.
- Like that?- Dont you look at me.
Im talking to you.
Im cleaning up.
Really?
Stop looking at me.You arent allowed to look at me.
Then put some clothes on.
I said stop it.You dont deserve it.
Come on.
You dont like presents.You dont like nice things.
Besides, youre too old.
I dont need an old person.
You probably couldntdo it anyway.
Dont.
- Get up.- No.
I dont want people tothink youre getting this.
- You want it so badly.- I dont want it.
I dont want you.
You dont get to have this.Go sit over there.
All you get to do is watch.
( Gasps )
Wheres Harry?
Who cares?
Oh, Im sorry.Do you need to see Mr. Campbell?
No.
Is Roger Sterling still here?
Yes.
I want you to let him dowhatever he wants.
And I want you to pencil inan appointment tomorrow
at the coffee shop in the ferrybuilding in Staten Island.
 :  A.M.
With Coca-Cola.
Okay.
Thatll be all.
I dont thinkthose people like me.
Thats not true.
Well, Im not sure I like them.
The reason I didnt wantyou to have that party is
I didnt want them in our home.
Youve only been in thecreative end of this business
for three months.
And being a secretary,you dont know what goes on.
There isnt one problem that Peggyor anybody in that office has
that wasnt there before you.
You think youre a splinter?
Youre not.
The whole foots beeninfected for years.
I love going to work with you
because you love workand you love me.
But I wonder if
maybe its not a good idea.
I dont really care about work.
I want you at work
because I want you.
I think we have toreplace the rug.
Just because you see white carpet in amagazine doesnt mean its practical.
Its beautiful.
Well, Ive taken a lot ofpictures of white carpets.
You have to havefour or five on hand.
I thought you wanted it.
I just wanted youto have what you want.
What are you doing?
Ive got to goto Staten Island.
- What time is it?- Shut up.
An aboveground pool?
No, no, in the ground.With deck chairs.
That costs a fortune.You gonna dig it yourself?
Well see what happensat Christmas.
I never count on a bonus.
Im not talking to you.
I hope to be dead by Christmas.
( All laugh )
Do you have any moneyfor the grocer?
You told me notto write any checks.
No, of course.
Shh.
Shh.
Hes finally gone to sleep.
( Elevator dings )
We cannot call security.They are applicants.
Whats going on out there?
Theyre all here responding toyour hilarious advertisement.
Oh.
Is it just me, or is thelobby full of negroes?
- They saw the Y&R ad.- ( Laughs )
The humor was lost on them.
- Not on me.- It was a childish prank.
Because youreabove that, right?
What are we gonna do?
Would you leave us be, dear?
Tell them the positionsbeen filled.
Theres the possibility that wecould be the subject of a protest.
Then we interview them.Forever. Theyll go away.
That is not a solution.
And whos to say theresnot a reporter out there?
I dont know whywe cant just hire one.
Because were nothiring anyone.
Just fire that receptionist.
We cant have one out there.
- What is that?- Its from Young & Rubicam.
Its a resume.
"    to   ,
toted dat barge,lifted dat bale."
( Laughs )
Did those people out there
see that artifact come in here?
Yes.Im positive.
Good morning.
Id like to thankyou all for coming.
First of all, were onlylooking for secretaries.
So, gentlemen,you are free to leave.
I mean, you arewelcome to leave.
I mean, you may go.( Clears throat )
I will be collecting resumes.
And then those of youwho meet the qualifications
will receive a callto schedule an interview.
