- ( speaking french )- president johnson went onnationwide television
To express his shockand personal griefat the tragedy.
( speaking french )
...Looking subdued and grimat the thought
Of what this actcould mean in a country
Already tautwith racial tension.
He said he applaudedthe escalation of decay.
So sick of thatmarxist bull_ó_.
So far its onlylooting in harlem,
But a lot of placesare on fire.
Well, its raining.
Do you thinkyour secretary is okay?
Sylvia and arnoldare in dc.
My father just hidesbehind his intellect.
He doesnt wantto feel any emotions.
Lets watch inside.
Maybe we can fall asleep.
( tv turns off )
( phones ringing )
- ( knocks )- am I disturbing you?
No. Im not gonna judge youif you want a drink.
The man knew how to talk.
I dont know why,but I thought thatwould save him.
I thought it would solvethe whole thing.
Oh, I dont know if hejust wants to hold hands,
But my insurance friendfrom last night, he called.
He wants to come inat 3:00.
Ill have caroline remind yousince youre on your own.

My mother wantedto be with her sister.
Abe said it couldhave been a lot worse.
Im so sorry.
I knew it wasgoing to happen.
He knew it wasgoing to happen.
But its not gonnastop anything.
And these foolsrunning in the streets--
Its exactlywhat he didnt want.
You should go home.
In fact, none of usshould be working.
Thank you.
Is this reallywhat happened?
You didnttell me anything.
They got it right,except that it was terrifying.
Walking into that angry,crazy crowd
And lindsaysmiling like he was goingto a pancake breakfast.
The only liveshis honor seemedworried about protecting
Were the photographers.
- But it worked.- Ill tell you what worked.
Cutting deals with allthe militants last year.
Well, Im gladyou were there.
Me, too.And I got to go back in.

I just thought workingmight take my mind off things.
Good luck.Been on the phoneall morning.
Theyre worried aboutlast night, obviously,
But theyre worriedabout tonight, theyreworried about the weekend.
- Who?- The clients.
They wont take make-goods.They want money back.
- Thats disgusting.- I dont know.
Its enoughof this crap already.
All these specialbroadcasts preemptingthe prime-time schedule.
"bewitched," merv,dean martin.
You know they mightcancel the stanley cup?
How dare you?
This cannot be made good.
Its shameful.
Its a shameful,shameful day!
Dont you scream at me.
You dont think Im upsetabout that man being sh*t?
Only becauseits costing you,you pig!
Its costingall of us.
Until they turn the mostbeautiful city in the worldinto a s_ó_ hole.

Did you know we werein the presence ofa bona fide r*cist?
Thats the latestthing, isnt it?Everybodys a r*cist.
Gentlemen!
I urge you to shake handsin the spirit of erasingthese remarks.
Im sorry.
I suppose that my commentswere inappropriate.
I mistook thisfor a workday.
Dont worry.Im sure you canmake your money back
On some movie of the weeknext fall
About the deathof a great man.
That is not what I meant.
Let me put thisin terms youll understand.
That man had a wifeand four children.

( knocks )
Im sorry Im late.
Would you like coffee?
Dawn, Im just gladyoure okay.
Joan was tryingto reach you.
The phone was outfor a little bit last night
And, well, it tooksome time to get here.

I couldnt reach you.I assumed you werentcoming in.
My mother told me I should.
Well, mr. Cooper justannounced that out of respect

Oh, my offer.I completely forgotabout that.

Theyre probablyon pins and needles.
So am I.Do I want to liveup there?
Get ahold of yourself.The other buyer never came in.


Why dont we come inat 5,000 under asking
And give them 24 hoursto respond?
Well let the tv newsdo the rest.

Randall, would youlike a drink?
Never.I really donteven want to talk.
I was trying tocommunicate without words,but its not working.
Randy, it never works.
Randall has an ideaand the ad directorwont take a chance.
Youre in the propertyinsurance business.
Ill bet youre aboutto get hit pretty hard.
Forget about that.
This is abouta no bull_ó_ approach
To why I gotinto this business.
People say they care.
I really care.
Were waitingfor you, randall.
All I seewhen I close my eyes
Is our nameand a molotov cocktail
Being lit with a match.
And then a couponat the bottom.
The ad sales guydidnt like that?
I know what it looks like--fearmongering.
But this is the opposite.
This is a coded messagethat came to me
When I was visitedby the spirit
Of dr. King last night.
He said that I should questionthe whole property thing, man.
It makes you happy, right?
( stifled laugh )
No, I think it was
His end will alwaysbe in poor taste.
cause youd rathernot think about it.
But there is a tear,and in that tear
Are all the tearsin the world,
All the animals crying.
Youre right--I dont want to thinkabout it.
What dons saying isdespite what we believe
To be good intentions,
Youre allowingthe emotions of the day,
And whatever elseyou got in your system,to influence your judgment.
Are you forgettingwhat tecumseh said?
Heya howa howa hoya.
- Heya howa howa.- I had forgotten that.
Well think about it.
This is an opportunity.
The heavensare telling us to change.
You talkedto dr. Kings ghost?
Make sure randydoesnt get lost.
- I had to waitaround for that?- I dont know.
He was very emotional.He talked me off a roof once.
I kind of owed him.You want a drink?
I just want to go home.
Someones gonna dothat idea, you know.
Not us.
Reporter:Three deathshave been reported
In the washingtonrioting so far.
There are no details yeton the circumstancessurrounding them.
More than 350 personshave been treatedfor injuries.
- Among them, severalpolicemen and firemen.- ( phone ringing )
Firefighting was hamperedif for no other reason
By the sheer volumeof the alarms.
But still, some personswere injured and...
Megan:Its betty. Youre supposedto pick up the kids.
Oh, s_ó_.
Got it.Hello.
I knew you would forget.
You really want themdown here?
I know you dont.You get out of everyopportunity to see them.
You dont even knowhow strange theyre acting.
The news is very upsetting.
Im sure it has nothingto do with the fact
That their fatherforgot about them.
You want meto come up thereand get them,
Drive right througheverything after dark?
Well, of course,henry thinks its fine,
But hes not as concernedabout their safety as you are.
Well, henry would know.
I guarantee youd goto canada on your knees
To pick up your girlfriend.
I dont believe this.
Im going to get the kids.
...Relatively littleinterference duringthe afternoon.
Really?
They called in the troopsin washington,
But henry sayswere fine here.
Shes a piece of work.
Looting spread to the downtownshopping section of the city
And as darkness fell,arrests increased.
( sirens wailing )
You finished with that?You can walk me to work.
Im already at work.
Since when are yougoing in on Saturday?
Since I dont want to bein front of the tv set.
Good as new.

This is a mess.
You cant sew,you cant cook,you cant clean.

You need a girl.
But maybe youdont like em.
I like girls, dad.
If that was true,youd be in bedwith her right now.
I dont thinkanybodys in the mood.
Its quite the opposite.
Nows the timewhen a man and a woman
Need to be togetherthe most.
In a catastrophe.
In the flood, the animalswent two by two.
You, youre gonna get onthe ark with your father.
I can findmy own girls, okay?
Okay.

I knew you wouldnt go.
You want some aspirin?
Hey.Turn it off.
( tv turns off )
Tell me exactlywhat your mother said.
Im not allowedto watch tv for a week.
Dr. Zaius:Man has no understanding.
He can be taughta few simple tricks,nothing more.
Dr. Zira:Im afraidI must disagree.
According tomy experiments--
Dr. Zira,I must caution you.
I guess your stomachis feeling better.
Why are you being punished?
I dont know.
Come on.
Because the wallpaperdidnt line up.
...The simian naturefrom a study of man
Is sheer nonsense,
Because manis a nuisance.
He eats up his food suppliesin the forest...
You maniacs!
You blew it up!
Oh, damn you!
God d_ó_ youall to hell!
The humansblew up new york?
All of america.
So he came back to here?
In the future.
Jesus.
You want to see it again?
Can we?

I need another half hour.
Oh, yeah.Just a minute.
Its for you.Its the real estate agent.
- Hello, ginny.- Well, we didnt get it.
Wh-- what happened?
Someone came ina little bit higher.
But you know what?It wasnt meant to be.
( sighs )how much higher?
It was stillunder asking, peggy.It wasnt meant to be.
Theres no other wayto think about it.Try, try again.
( hangs up )
Someone elsegot the apartment.
What are you gonna do?
- Thats it?- What do youwant me to say?
That you give a damn.
Peggy, this isan emotional story.
Stop being such a martyr.Youre having the timeof your life.
- Why are you so mad?- Because Im alone in this.
Thats not cool.
I dont mean financially.
I mean, dont you carewhere we live?
Look, I dont feel rightexpressing an opinion.
Now is your chance.
I dont want to liveon the upper east side.
Fine. Why?
I dont know.
I saw us raisingour kids in a place
With more differentkinds of people.
This photographertrailing me the other night,
He lives in the west 80s.
Isnt it dangerous?
No, its more rundown.
But thats whyits so cheap.
Get some lumber,a coat of paint--people are doing it.
I didnt knowyou felt that way.
About the upper east side.
I do.
Im sorry.
I just feltit wasnt my money.
How much of a saydo I have?
Youre in my life.
Youre a partof my life.
Peggy, Ive gotto finish this.
( typewriter clacking )
- Did you see this movie?- Not yet.
Do you getto see it for free?
- I do.- Its really good.
- Were seeing it again.- You enjoy yourself.
Everybody likesto go to the movieswhen theyre sad.
I was looking for you.You left the tv on.
I dont feel rightturning it off,
But I dont wantto watch it.
He doesnt even wantme to come in.
Everything hassettled down.
For the time being.
No, I think thisis the end of it.
Good.
Betty, I hope you knowyoull never have toworry about money.
Why would youbring that up?
Nothing.
I just keepasking myself,
- "what am I doing?"- about what?
I keep thinking aboutwalking through harlem,
Lindsay a few paces ahead,grinning like he always does,
The rest of usfollowing behind.
- Wasnt that frightening?- It was exhilarating.
But what was the costof avoiding that riot?
Police corruption,disrespect for authority,
Negotiating with hoodlums.
You cant say thatto the mayor.
Hes never beenmore popular.
Its just, betty,
I keep thinking I woulddo it differently.
I want to do itdifferently.
And, well,they approached me
Like they always dowhen somebody dies
And they offered me a seatin the state senate.
Do you want to run?
Run?Its a republican seat.
Its basically unopposed.
- Youd have to quitthe mayors office.- Hell understand.
You think Im the first guysick of being in a flank?
I feel like Ive beenasking you to do thissince I met you.
Well, I finally heard you.
Its a stepping stoneto state attorney general.
- And--- and who knows what else?
Easy, partner.
This is whatIve wanted for you.
Us.
I cant waitfor people to meet you.
You know?Really meet you.
Everyones in bed.
Gene finallyclimbed in with sally.
( sighs )
I felt better,but now I dont.
- Why?- Because who knowswhat youre feeling?
I didnt knowwhat to say to her
Except, "Id tell youto ask your father,
But hes at the movies."
I should have said,"hes just drunk."
Youre better with them.
You dont understand.
I do.
You dont have marx,youve got a bottle.
Is this what you reallywant to be to them
When they need you?
No.
( sighs )
I dont think I everwanted to be the manwho loves children.
But from the momenttheyre born...
That baby comes out
And you act proudand excited
And hand out cigars...
But you dontfeel anything.
Especially if you hada difficult childhood.
You want to love them,but you dont.
And the factthat youre...
Faking that feeling
Makes you wonder
If your own fatherhad the same problem.
Then one daythey get older...
And you see themdo something...
And you feel...
That feeling
That you werepretending to have.
And it feelslike your heartis going to explode.
That was fasterthan I expected.
Are things calmer out there?
Well, then...
Have a good night.
Hey.
