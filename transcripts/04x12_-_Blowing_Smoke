First, I want to assure you that no oneat my agency knows about this meeting.
-I appreciate that.-Im here to help.
I have my own thoughts,but how would you describe your...
Well, your current frustrations?
During the w*r, Heinz was all about beans,
but now, obviously, ketchup is king.
Im happy for the company, but Imafraid weve become the fading older sister.
So ketchup, chili sauce and soupend up over at DDB,
and vinegar, sauces and beansend up at Ketchum MacLeod.
I dont know why Im disappointed,I asked for straightforward.
I just thought they would talk me out of it.
They obviously dont knowwhat kind of client you are.
Well, Ive been working a long time.
I know that despite the publics imagination,food is cyclical.
I dont mean seasonal.
But I mean, literally, theres a time for beans,and theres a time for ketchup.
But I dont have that time,so I wanna force the issue.
You know, something inventive.
Humor worked with the pickles,but pickles are funny.
The way beans are funny, we cant use that.We have to fight it, actually.
Well, its very possible that Heinz beansdont need to be funny,
because theyre a food, not a condiment.Theyre substantial.
You know,Id love to have that conversation.
And the reason I agreed to meet with you isbecause I hoped it would spark something,
and maybe six to eight months from nowyou can call me with a humdinger.
How about six days?
No. No, this is my point.
I want to move,but theres a lot that goes with it.
Theres a breaking-in period thats months.
-Thats true, but...-Im sorry to be so blunt,
but I dont know that your companywill be here in six months.
I do.
Thats what Im hoping.
Thats why my answer is not "No,"its just "Not now."
So wheres the harm in coming inand hearing some ideas?
Because I cant afford to move my businessa third time in two years.
I just cant.
I see.
So, thats where we are.
Hold on.
Raymond, I will have an exciting idea.I happen to know that.
Would a discounted commissionmake up for the break-in period?
I bet I could get a datewith your mother right now.
Well, you can seewhy I dont want to let this go.
Look, Don, youre a hell of an idea man,but let the account boys do this part.
I wish you the best of luck.
Thank you. It was really great to meet you.
Excuse me, waiter.
Sally, Bobby!
Youre filthy.
Can I take it away from him?
The spoon or the screaming, take your pick.
I want two hot dogs.
Your eyes are bigger than your stomach.
How come we never eat with Henry?
First of all, he works until lateand youre always saying, "Im hungry."
Second of all, you dont eat the same food.
Ill try new food.
Would you like to eat with Henry?
Why dont Bobby and Gene eat first,and Ill wait to eat with you and Henry?
Okay. Let me think about it.
Okay.
Youre paying me to assess your situation,
but I couldve told youfrom three blocks away
that signing new business,no matter what the size, is of the essence.
Not only because your billingshave shrunk by 50%,
but because theres not much timebefore youll be perceived as stagnant,
or worse, decaying.
Listen, Doctor,we know theres a black spot on the x-ray.
You dont have toKeep tapping your finger on it.
I recommend that you dowhat you do best, cigarettes.
You understand the FTC.You understand the Surgeon General.
You have a team in placewith account management
and media expertisewhich is up and running.
And, of course, you have Don.
You are a certain kind of girl,and tobacco is your ideal boyfriend.
Can you get us a date?
Philip Morris is introducinga new brand for young women,
hoping to have it on the marketin 18 months,
and theyd like a new agency on itfrom the ground floor.
How much is it?
Close to $5 million.
Its a start.
Wonderful.
And what stage of the processhas your influence bought us?
A meeting. No one else has one.
We will listen more than we will speak.
Like a good girlfriend.
Sounds great.
I concur.
All Im saying is we should be goingafter something as big as what we had.
Itd cost a fortune to pursueone when its in review.
And theyre impossible to pry away.
Our day-to-day payroll will be beyond usby the next billing cycle.
We should start thinking aboutreducing staff
and subletting the square footage.
Why even have an office?Why dont we just work out of a cab?
And where does that leave me?
Trying to get my calls returned withall the buying power of Secor Laxative?
We gave him Don and a finders fee.He shouldve aimed higher.
I just left Geyer for this.
Do you think those clientsare in love with me?
Im getting married in October!Its gonna be barefoot in the park.
These things go in streaks.
And Don Draper with a cigarette company?
We get this vote of confidence,and we move from there.
Marlboro was their womens cigarette.
Well, they certainly ran away from thatin the right direction.
You know, beans, vinegars and sauceswas very impressed.
Thank you for that,but thank you much more for this.
This is what I was hoping for.
Good. Geoffs excited.
Study up.
I have dinner plans but call me tonight,even if its just to work.
Its a summer practice helmet.its not as good.
It smells.
Well, youre there all the time.What do you talk about?
Didnt you go?
Yeah, but psychiatrists are easy to fool.
Dr. Ednas smart.
She tell you to kiss your moms ass?
No.
So whos smarter, me or her?
You want one?
No.
Do you talk to your mom about me?
I did, and I dont anymore.
She doesnt like me. She thinks...
She doesnt like kids.
Thats not true.
Youre the one whos always sayinghow mean she is.
So what?
-Ive gotta go.-Okay.
See you later, alligator.
Don.
Midge.
I just came out from a meetingat a magazine related to Time Life
and I saw this dashing figure.
Where are you goingwith so much purpose?
Home. You look good.
Im skinny. Starving artist.
-Did you move here?-Yes.
Well, I have my own firm now.
Draper, Draper and Draper?
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Well, it sounds impressive.
There are good days and bad days,like anything else.
So you wouldnt happen to needany freelance artists, would you?
I wish I could help right now.Maybe in six months.
You can use me as a reference.
Really?
I thought I wouldve run into youin The Village.
Im always expecting to see you in the park.
What are you doing in The Village?Admiring the wildlife?
I live there, on Waverly.
Yeah.
So whats the rush to go home? Come over.
I have a big meeting tomorrow.Maybe some other time.
Not even to meet my husband?
-Really?-Well, its not romantic.
We just got married for the bread.
Well eat, youll buy a painting,Ill cheer you up.
Look, I lost my purse.At least give me a ride downtown.
Okay.
I told her I brushed my teeth,but she said I still smelled like spaghetti.
And what did you do?
I brushed my teeth again.
And what did she do?
She doesnt care what the truth isas long as I do what she says.
Got any sevens?
Nope. Go fish.
I hate sevens.
Why?
I just do.
You know, Im very proudof how you found a way to behave so well,
even when you get so angryat your mother sometimes.
Its hard to control ourselveswhen we get so angry.
She just doesnt know that Im mad.
As long as you know it.
I told you your mom acts that waybecause she has stresses.
Not because youre bador that you did anything wrong.
I know.
Do you have any aces?
No, go fish.
So now that youre back in school,
we probably should be seeinga little less of each other.
Just one day a week.
So that you can ride your bike,
and be with your friendsand be in the ballet recital.
Okay.
Do you have any threes?
I said Im very proud of you.Did you hear that?
Do you have any jacks?
Perry, we have company.
This is my friend, Don.
Perry. Nice to meet you.
-Sorry to drop in,-Oh, no.
Why dont you offer Don a drink?
Sure. Don, what are you gonna have?
I have vodka or brown?
Whiskeys good.
Good. Good.
Ill get a couple of glasses.
So youre a playwright?
When we met,I said he looked like Brendan Behan.
You said Dylan Thomas.
Here we go.
To welcome company.
Let me go freshen upand make sure we have toilet paper.
So, Don, let me open your eyes for a minute.Come here.
Can you believe this?
-Whats it called?-Number four
The whole thing is about what she seeswhen she closes her eyes.
Its part of this thing that shes doing.Its called an afterimage.
Whats more real?
Its nice.
You know, I have a price list somewhere.
Of course, you know,whatever youre willing to pay.
I mean,I Know shed love for you to have one.
Let me think about it.
You know, its not hard to see thingsare a little tough around here,
but she digs you.
And I could tell youshed do anything if you bought one.
Are you sure about that?
Were not possessive,
and you shouldve heard how excitedshe was when she tracked you down.
What?
You know, the look on her facewhen she walked in here with you.
See, I knew I shouldnt have leftyou two alone.
Are you kidding?Were getting along famously.
You know what?
Im gonna get some groceriesand whip up a great meal.
Midge? Honey?
She lost her purse.
Right.
Don, dont.
My father owned a restaurant.I can make chicken cordon bleu.
Here. How about that?
$107
Well, okay.
You two sit tight. Ill be right back.
-Hes very interesting.-Hes an idiot.
Hes just gonna go outand put that in his arm.
And you couldve gottenso much more from me.
Thats why you tracked me down,like James Bond.
God! Hes such an idiot.
I just wanted you to buy a painting.
I swear.
Whats it like?
Its like drinking 100 bottles of whiskey
while someone licks your tits.
I can see its very good.
He said it would help metake my mind off my work.
Turns out, its a full-time job.
Why dont you stop?
I know its bad for me, but...
Its heroin, Don.
I just cant stop.
I am glad to see you, you know?
This is $300.
You know, for Number four over there.
Don.
What am I gonna do with a check?
Heres $120 in cash.
Do you think my works any good?
Does it matter?
You know, I dont even have car fare.
You can walk across the park.Do some advertising for me.
Like a sandwich board.
Its really great to see you, Don.
Im glad you havent changed.
It was the way he slammed the car doorlike that.
It was so dismissive.
It reminded me of Don,but, of course, it wasnt.
When I confronted him later,it turned out he hadnt heard me.
Thats what he said, anyway.
Well, you learned something, didnt you?
I did.
Our time is almost up,
so I thought that I should tell you that
I believe Sally has madewonderful progress,
and that Id like to reduce her sessionsto once a week and see where we are.
So shes cured?
Shes not better. She ran away.
And she understandswhat she did was wrong,
and shes been very responsible since.
Her life is chaotic,
and Im afraid of losing this influence.
Ive noticed that every timeyou come in here,
you have many things on your mind.
And I feel thatyou should have your own time
where you get to sayeverything you want to say.
I have a very talented colleague,Dr. Evelyn Shapiro, whom I can recommend.
Why cant I talk to you?
Betty, you can talk to me but, you know,
Im a child psychiatrist.
Well, I dont need a psychiatrist. I just...
Obviously, Im willing to do whateveryou recommend as Sally progresses.
And I would hope, of course,
that if she continues to make progress,that we could continue to discuss that.
Of course.
So Ill keep you in the books for next month.
If you think so.
Peter Piper picked a peckof pickled peppers.
Red leather, yellow leather,red leather, yellow leather.
-You wanted to see me?-I did.
-Did you do all the reading?-Yes.
If strategy comes up,and it usually doesnt at this point,
what do you think they thinkthe strength is of this product?
Well, as you know, its pointlessto get women to switch from mens brands.
Nobody switches.
Theyre probably looking for a new wayto give them out for free.
Sorry to interrupt.Mr. Draper, Dr. Atherton is on his way up,
the partners are gathering in the lobby,
and Dr. Miller called to say, "Break a leg."
Thank you.
What were you saying?
I was saying youre gonna do great.
Morning.
Im afraid I have some unfortunate news.
They canceled the meeting.
-Are you kidding me?-What?
They decided to give it to Leo Burnett.
Burnett has Marlboro already.
I thought they wanted a fresh start with this.
So did I.
Theyre excited to seewhere you are in six months.
Six months means never.Theyre letting us die.
I thought this was a sure thing.
Down the road, perhaps.
Theres no reason to be discouraged.
The wind is blowing ice cold out there.
We cant even get a meetingwith a damn tobacco account!
Take it inside.
Youre an assh*le, you know that?
Mr. Crane, out.
They cant even dignify us with an excuse?
They dont need an excuse.
Its because were desperate.They can smell it on us.
We reek of it like some sweaty salesmanknocking on his last door!
Because were going after scraps.
What about United Airlines,General Motors?
-Do you think thats easier?-Then what? You have a plan?
Im out thereb*at the bushes every day for anything.
-You should try it.-Just out of caution, I met with the bank.
Theyve agreed to extend our line of credit,
but they would like usto post some collateral.
You went to the bank?Theres a vote of confidence.
$100,000 each from the senior partners,
and $50,000 from Mr. Campbell and Iwould buy us six months or so,
provided we makea drastic reduction in staff.
$50,000? Absolutely not.
Its an obligation of your contract.
All we need is a bridgeto cold and flu season
and Vicks will take us to the holidays.
Sugarberry Hams will pick up. Samsonite...
Its a hardship for me as well,but its a necessity.
We should move.We should never have been here.
You think we look desperate now?
Well, if you figure it out,you Know where to find me.
For a little while, anyway.
And then I was floating over town.Standing straight up, not like Superman.
Only it wasnt Ossining, it was London.Like Mary Poppins.
Do you want the backwash?
I fly in some of my dreams.It feels like being in the ocean.
I just felt like I was going to heaven,except I dont believe in it.
You dont?Then what happens when you die? Nothing?
It doesnt really bother me,except for its forever.
When I think about forever, I get upset.
Like the Land O Lakes butterhas that Indian girl, sitting, holding a box.
And it has a picture of her on it,holding a box.
With a picture of her on it, holding a box.
Have you ever noticed that?
I wish you wouldnt have said that.
Sorry. I have to go.
Yeah, I should, too.
Ill save my Fritos for you.
-May I speak with you?-Are you busy?
No. Do you want one?
No.
Philip Morris set up the meeting,then told Leo Burnett about it
to leverage a sweeter deal.
So they used us.Is that supposed to make me feel better?
Everyone at Burnett is already braggingabout how we never even got a meeting.
What do you want?
I wanna know why Im being punishedfor being the only business left around here-
Were all being punished.
I dont have that kind of money.
Pete, Im doing everything I can.Get me in a room.
-Miss Olson to see you.-Come in!
Everybodys waiting in the conference room.
For what?
Well, we were all gonna leave when you left,but you didnt go, so what should we do?
-I dont care.-What happened?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
What are we gonna do?
Peggy, its not your problem.
I know,but I have been thinking about the company,
and I was wonderingwhat you thought about...
You know,why dont we just change our name?
If this was a dog food,wed change the name.
We cant start over. We just started.
You always say, "if you dont likewhat theyre saying about you,
-"change the conversation."-To what?
What theyre saying about us is true.
So theres nothing we can do?
Sure there is. Were gonna sit at our desksand keep typing
while the walls fall down around us,because were creative.
The least importantmost important thing there is.
You cant slam the door like that.
Why didnt you call me back?The bank called.
Something about a loan application?
-They called here?-Yes.
Do you have something you want to tell me?
Its not important.
To think you still want to surprise meafter five years of marriage.
When can I start looking?Im so in love with Greenwich.
Were not buying a house, Trudy.
The partners each need to put in a lump sumto keep the payroll we have going,
so people dont lose their jobs.
What? How much?
Well, its $50,000,and we have $22,000 in the bank,
not counting the baby gifts,which will remain for the baby.
Its all for the baby,for Tammy to have a yard to run around in.
Central Park was good enough for me.
When you bet big and lose,you dont double down.
Its in my contract. Ill lose my partnership.
Youll lose your stateroom on the Titanic?
You are forbiddento give anything more to that company.
You dont get to forbid me.
Lower your voice!


And dont even thinkabout asking my father.
”Why Im quitting tobacco."
"Recently, my advertising agency
”ended a long relationshipwith Lucky Strike cigarettes.
"And im relieved.
”For over 25 years, we devotedourselves to peddling a product
”for which good work is irrelevant,
”because people cant stop themselvesfrom buying it.
”The product that never improves,
”causes illness and makes people unhappy.
”But there was money in it.
"A lot of money.
”In fact, our entire business depended on it.
”We knew it wasnt good for us,but we couldnt stop.
"And then, when Lucky Strike movedtheir business elsewhere,
”l realized here was my chanceto be someone who can sleep at night
”because I knowwhat im selling doesnt k*ll my customers.
"So as of today,Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce
"will no longer take tobacco accounts.We know its gonna be hard.
”If youre interested in cigarette work,heres a list of agencies that do it well:
"BBDO, Leo Burnett, McCann Erickson,
"Cutler Gleason and Chaoughand Benton and Bowles."
"As for us, we welcome all other business,
"because were certain that our best workis still ahead of us.
"Sincerely, Donald F. Draper,
"Creative Director,Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce."
-Good morning, Don.-Stan.
Good morning.
Good morning. Any calls?
Yes, quite a few.Mostly reporters and citizens, Dr. Miller.
Anyone else?
Someone named Emerson Foote andpeople from those agencies you mentioned.
Theyre looking for you.
Can you get Dr. Miller?
Somebody used your nameto end our business in the newspaper.
-its not you, is it?-Its su1c1de!
Its insane! How the hell could you do this?Why would you do this?
Because someone had to do something.
You put the company name on it.You shouldve consulted us.
Why?To evaluate its strengths and weaknesses?
To knock it down to risk versus reward?Its done!
And I slept last nightfor the first time in a month.
You slept? Really?
You werent smiling,thinking about the taste of shit
that would be in everybodys mouthover breakfast today?
No one asked youto euthanize this company.
What did you expect,for us to pat you on the back?
Dont you realize the clientsare all going to think
you could turn on them at any minute?
Im not going to explain to you what I did.Its an ad for this agency.
If you dont understand it,then you shouldnt be in this business.
You humiliated usby not putting our names on it!
You left us with this hypocrisy!
So deny it!
I did what I thought was bestfor the company.
You can either back me or not.
You did what was best for you,because youre impatient and childish.
You had a tantrum on a full pagein The New York Times.
So no one is happy about this?
I dont know.
Its good enough to be the reasonthis place went down anymore.
-Excuse me.-Yes?
Theres someone calling fromSenator Kennedys office.
Robert Kennedy wants to speak with you.
Please hold for the Senator.
Ls this here Don Draper?
-Yes.-This is Bobby Kennedy.
How are you this lovely morning?
Im well. Thank you, Senator.
Bobby, please.
Listen, I just wanted to say that I admire
your fortitude and vigorand standing up to what I consider to be
one of the great menaces to this civilizationas we know it.
Thats very flattering-
I have one question:
Does your company representSecor Laxatives?
Yes. Yes, we do.
Well, are you gonna be writinganything against them?
Because I want to make it clearthat I am firmly anti-laxative-
Who the hell is this?
Teddy Chaough.
Thanks for sticking my name in therewith the big boys.
A full-page ad in The Times.What did that run you?
A little mix-up there.That was Eunice Kennedy.
Keep joking. Youre cynical and craven.
Tobacco put a roof over your headand it fed your children.
And then it k*ll my business.
I never thought you had the stomachfor a partnership.
Im no longer a part of this agency.
You there, get my shoes.
Bert, calm down.
I will not. Weve created a monster.
Ive already informed the other partners.
Ill need your contributionby close of business, as it were.
You know this could work.
Do you realizeIve just moved my family back here?
Im terribly sorry about that.
Did you get Dr. Miller?
Yes, but you were on with...You were on the phone.
She said shed stop by later.
Okay, thatll be all.
By the way, I loved the letter.
I love that you stand for something.
Megan, thats not really what its about.
I know that part. I know it was about"he didnt dump me, I dumped him."
I just love that you did it.
It feels different around here.
Thank you.
-So who else called?-Everyone whos anyone.
"Smokey the Bear, Smokey Robinson,
"Chiquita Banana, Aunt Jemima."
Is he gonna quit smoking?
Youre an idiot.
I heard from all my clients this morning,mostly out of morbid curiosity.
But one tnings for sure, tneyre not talkingabout Lucky Strike anymore.
Well, I think that was the whole idea.
Theyre gonna fire everybody,or worse, make me fire everybody.
Well, its been a pleasureworking with you all.
I wish you the best of luck.
I didnt think theyd start with him.
Peggy, Mr. Draper wants to see you.
Okay.
Its a dog-eat-dog world.
-Should I close the door?-Yes.
Should I sit down?
Who can you live without?
Good. I mean, not good, but, you know...
Well, Danny, obviously,though hes Kind of grown on me.
Lane sent over a memo with suggestions.
"All of the tobacco people,Mark Coyle, Wuzna..."
The Polish kid, "Danny and Bill."
Thats a lot of people.
Are we going under?
No. Of course not.
I just wanted to give you noticeso when they all come to you,
youll know whats going on.
Okay.
So?
You havent said anything about the letter.
I thought you didnt go infor those kinds of shenanigans.
Sally Draper.
Stop, both of you.
What are you doing here?
You stay away from her! You hear me?
Lets go.
Were not going back for your bike.
I told you, hes my friend.We dont do anything.
That boy is bad.
No, hes not.
Believe me. I know him better than you do.
You dont know him at all.
Go to your room.
You stopped by.
Yes. Im glad to see you smiling.
Well, they all want to k*ll me,but I have a bodyguard.
-Can I get you anything?-No, thank you.
Whats this?
My things.
We had to resign.
Geoff Athertonwants another cigarette account someday.
Im so sorry. I didnt think about that.
I know.
Im really sorry.
So,
youre gonna make it through this day,then youre going to leave this office,
meet me for dinner in the open,wherever I want,
and were gonna talk about anythingbut work,
because we can do that now.
Its a fair trade.
La Caravelle, 8:00?
Sure.
Have your girl make reservations.
Just wanted to say goodbye.
No. What happened?
Tobacco is very touchy.
Whos gonna do our research?
You know, I just lost one of my best jobs-
No, I mean, I love working with you.
Would you have a drink with me?
-I dont want to linger.-Not right now. Just...
I hate to think Im not gonna see you.
Thats sweet.
No, I mean it.
You do your job so well,
and they respect you,and you dont have to play any games.
I didnt know that was possible.
Is that what it looks like?
Im sure well work together again,somewhere.
Hello there.
So Im home early for a family dinner.
They couldnt wait. We can eat later.
Ill eat with this crowd.
Well, I had quite a day.
That doesnt sound good.
Its this neighborhood.Its being taken over by low-caliber people.
I think its time for us to move.
Great. You know how I feel about it.
I like that place in Rye.
Rye? Isnt that where Playland is?
Shell get over it.
Roger, Don, Harry and myself
should probably begin the processof letting people go
to avoid any further damage to morale.
And please try and limitany sympathetic adjustments to severance.
Yes, and as Lane mentioned, well tryto hold onto any Staplers, scissors,
hole punches and tape dispensers.
They do disappear.
Don, are you ever gonna call backthe American Cancer Society?
Theyve tried you twice this morning.
I saw that. its a joke.
Its not. They finally called me.
They want us to come in and meetabout an anti-smoking campaign.
Really?
Took me about five minutesto stop laughing. I hope I didnt blow it.
Well, thats interesting, right?
Great. Public service. Free work.
Thats just what we should be doingright now.
Its prestigious.
But we cant eat prestige.
Someone called us.We could have new work on the air.
Theres a lot of bigwigs on the board.
Under normal circumstances,I would consider this an opportunity.
Absolutely.
Yes, Don saved the company.Now go get rid of half of it.
We should probably stay in here.
I suppose.
Lane, may I speak with you a moment?
Well, Ive gotta go learn a bunchof peoples names before I fire them.
I know you said the end of business today,but that money, I dont have it.
Is there any way I can owe iton advance against bonus or future salary?
Calm yourself. Don paid your share.
What?
Perhaps you werent supposed to know that.
Well, thank you for the opportunity.
It was my pleasure.
Bill.
