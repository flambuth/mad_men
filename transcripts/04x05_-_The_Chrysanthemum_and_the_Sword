In addition to the two major cough dropusers, smokers and cold sufferers,

The technical term is "hypochondriacs."

Donald Drapers office.
Hello?
You said not to buzz you all the time,but I dont know how else to do this.
You have a phone call.
You can buzz me for a phone call.
Things like coffee after Ive said no,you dont have to ask again.
Youre always asleep in here.
Walter Hoffman from The Times.Hes a reporter.
Whats it regarding?
You want me to go ask?
I think were done here.
New York Times.
This is Don.
Hi. its Walter Hoffmanfrom The New York Times.
I write the advertising column.
I know who you are.What can I do for you, Walter?
I just wanted to know if youd heard
that Cutler Gleason and Chaoughjust signed Clearasil.
I dont keep track of accountsonce we resign them.
I just think its kind of interesting
that first CGC takes the Jai AlaiAssociation from you and now this.
-How do you explain it?-I dont think about it.
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough
and he said, "Every time Don Draperlooks in his rearview mirror, he sees me."
You have a partners luncheon.
Whats your point?
My point is do you have a response?
On the record?
Please.
Ive never heard of him.
Anything else?
No. Have a good day.
This Selma thing is not going away.
You still dont thinkthey need a civil rights law?
They got what they wanted.Why arent they happy?
Because Lassiestays at the Waldorf and they cant.
Please tell me I missed everything.
I now call to order a meeting of the partners,
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.In attendance...
Everybody.
Very well then, Mr. Campbell.
Secor Laxative has finally agreed to producea television commercial and test market it.
Howd you ease them into it?Mustve had to loosen them up first.
Weve had that client for 18 years, Roger.
Pete has other news.
A Deerfield chum of mineroped me into a dinner for the Asia Society,
the result of which was a seriesof interesting phone calls and one lunch
regarding the Honda Motorcycle Company.
They control over 50% of the US market.
Ive seen them. Theyre cute.
Theyre miserable at Grey.
Well, 50% of the market, who wouldnt be?
"Wheres my other half?"
Theyre taking meetings and as of 9:00this morning, were on the books.
Three million dollars in potential billings,
and theyre venturinginto automobiles as well.
When can you bring them in?
Listen, let me spare you the agonyand the ecstasy
and tell you we are not doing businesswith them.
Excuse me?
Look, I dont expect you to understand this,because you were a little boy,
but I used to be a man with a lot of friends.
Then World w*r II came and they wereall k*ll by your new yellow buddies.
Look,
if Bernbach can do businesswith Volkswagen,
we can do business with anybody.
The w*r is over, Roger.
Why dont we just bringDr. Lyle Evans in here?
Thatll be enough of that.
Lucky Strike is great. Meeting adjourned.
We dont usually put new business to a vote,do we?
Does anyone reallyhave a problem with this?
No. When can you bring them in?
Immediately, if possible.I dont want to lose our spot.
So far Ive been advised to readThe Chrysanthemum and the Sword.
From what I can tell,they have their own way of doing business.
Bert, Im hoping youll help usnavigate these waters?
Ill prepare a few salient points.Keep Roger out of the loop.
Another rather exciting possibility.
Good work.
Joan, get everybody that book.
I at least want themto see it on peoples desks.
Who the hell is Dr. Lyle Evans?
I have no idea.
The body of a 38-year-old Unitarian minister
was cremated within hoursof his death last night.
He had been clubbed by white menwho resented his coming to Selma
-to join n*gro civil rights demonstrations.-Come in.
-Hi.-Hi.
Sally?
Hello.
I brought my doctor kit.
Okay, Im gonna go.
Enjoy yourself. Which one is it?
I mean, which restaurant,in case I need to reach you.
Benihanas.
Youre going to see a girl, arent you?
Yes, I am.
-Whats her name?-Bethany.
I dont like that.
Well, you dont have to.
Bed by 9:00?
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
Jesus. What did you do?
You look like a mongoloid.
-Is it that bad?-Bobby, go to bed.
Sally, get over here.
No.
Good night.
Come over here.
Im not mad. Come on.
Your dad is gonna k*ll me.
Hes actually gonna k*ll me.
You have short hair and Daddy likes it.
That doesnt matter.
Youre not allowed to do thisand you know that.
Are you and Daddy doing it?
What?
I know what it is.
I know that the man pees inside the woman.
Where did you hear that?
A girl at school.
You should talk to your mommy.
I dont want to.
You dont need to know right now,so stop changing the subject.
Im sorry.
Do you understandIm in worse trouble than you are?
I just wanted to look pretty.
Come on.
Were gonna try and fix this, okay?
Youre not impressed.
-My hair smells like Ive been frying chicken.-It does?
Stop it.
This place is very expensive.
Thats not it. its just not very intimate.
Three dates in five months?Dont think I dont know why.
If it isnt the inscrutable Don Draper.
Ted.
-This is my wife Nan.-This is my friend Bethany.
Ted Chaough.
-Don Draper.-Pleasure.
Pleasure.
We just booked Howard Moses to sh**tClearasil. Have you ever worked with him?
Not yet.
I thought I was clever,but it looks like you and I had the same idea.
What are you talking about?
What do you think? Honda?
You think the rest of these touristsare from J Walter Thompson?
I suppose its possible.
Well, the good news is,I think its gonna be between us.
The bad news is the best mans gonna win.
Enjoy your dinner.
-We will.-Nice to meet you.
-What are you doing, Ted?-My job.
-Whos he?-Some fly I keep swatting away.
They havent done half of what we have.
The minute he declared himselfthe competition, suddenly we were equal.
Well, as far as Im concerned,hes no competition at all.
Hello?
Were not gonna let thisspoil our evening, are we?
No.
-Do you know how to use those?-Yes.
You think you could teach me?
-What time did they go to bed?-Im really, really sorry.
-They still up?-No.
Its just, I was watching I V with Bobbyand I turned around for a second
and Sally cut her hair.
What?
Its pretty bad.
I couldve just left them alone.
-She was in the bathroom. I didnt know.-Youre supposed to watch them.
Dont.
I finally got her to sleep.
Do you know the river of shitIm gonna get from her mother?
Im sorry about that. I tried to fix it,
but youll probablyneed to take her to the beauty parlor.
Why the hell did she do that?
She probably wanted to look olderlike Hayley Mills.
I dont know. I really shouldnt.
Consider it severance.
-Look...-I dont want your advice, okay?
Good night.
Its probably the kids.
Hi, Mom.
-Did you have a nice time?-Yeah.
Take that hat off.
Let me explain, okay?
-What the hell happened to you?-Calm down.
-You cut her hair?-No.
I cut it. Im sorry...
-Hey!-Betty.
It was an accident.
Jesus. Betts, is that necessary?
Im really, really sorry.
Damn right youre sorry.Get up to your room.
-Hold on.-No, now.
Itll be okay.
Bobby, take yourlittle brother outside and play.
You didnt have to hit her.
Youre right, because it doesnt do anything!
You have picture day.
-And forget about your sleepover.-Kids do this.
-You never did this?-All I wanted was to have long hair.
In fact when my mother was mad at me,she would threaten to cut my hair.
-Where the hell were you?-Look, it just happened.
The sitter wasnt paying attention.
You know what?I dont want to know about your life.
You cant even watch them for a second.its like leaving them with nobody.
Because youre so good with them?
Take her to the hairdresser.
Goodbye.
-Betty.-Henry, I dont want to hear it.
I want him dead!
You dont think I feel that?
I was divorced, Betty.
My weekends with Ellie were sacrosanct.
I probably paid for a building in playlandand he couldnt take a night off?
And who knows who he had watching her?Some secretary, another whore?
But...
Thats him, not Sally.
And little girls do do this,and not just ones from broken homes.
I know.
I was impulsive.
Ill apologize.
Having had a girl this age,
I can tell you that punishmentwill only make this worse.
So maybe, when youre apologizing,
you let her know shes going to goto the hairdresser
and she can go on her sleepover.
Reward her? Really?
Really.
Youre soft, you know that?
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.May I help you?
There you are. The Honda meetings today,and before you bite my head off,
Im up to date on the protocolwith the help of Cooper
and we dont have to do anythingbut avoid criticizing them or giving advice.
I ran into Ted Chaough.
How are they in this thingand how could you not know that?
This guys drafting off of us.
For the record, its JWT, CGC and us.
Now if you dont mind,I have to get some gifts wrapped
and get these chrysanthemumsout of the building.
Apparently they symbolize death.
So much conflicting information.
Allow me to show you around.
Our offices are probably more modernthan youve seen,
but thats the kindof company we are, forward-thinking.
This is what we call the creative lounge.
We cant tell you how it happens,but it does happen here.
This is too difficult.
Well, tell them something.
This is Joan Harris, our chief hostess.
Id like you to meetIchiro Kamura and Hachi Saito.
Nice to meet you.I hope no ones taken you to Benihana.
David Ogilvy.
Ive got a very good list of steakhouses.Just ask.
Not very subtle, are they?
No, they are not.
We are most happilylooking forward to presentation.
Not now, I hope.
We want more driver for motorcycle.
And we shall endeavor to make that happen.
And now that we are finished,please accept our modest gifts.
I cannot accept.
A small token.
No, thank you.
Please. You are our guests.
Thank you.
-Open it.-No.
Later, of course.
Its a cantaloupe.
Johnnie Walker Red.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Im sorry.
I didnt know this meeting was happening.
Then again,I know how some people love surprises.
I apologize, gentlemen,but for some reason I was not informed.
In fact, someone set a long lunch for mewith Randolph.
Well, it was last minuteand now, unfortunately, drawn to a close.
I have to warn you they wont knowits over until you drop the big one.
Twice.
The meeting is not over.
We have yet to present the rules.
So now youre dictating terms.
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito, this is Roger Sterling.
And this is their translator, Akira Takahashi.
We give each firm $3,000
for a competitive presentation.
In this packetare the conditions for the competition.
We dont want any conditions.We want it to be unconditional.
Akira, go ahead, tell them what I said.
Roger, stop it. These men are our guests.
I know exactly who these men are.
You think you can just come in hereand well fawn all over you?
We b*at you and well b*at you again.
And we dont want any of your Jap crap.
So, sayonara.
If you could only know my embarrassment.
His wifes very sick. Hes been drinking a lot.
You have our rules.
We very much look forwardto your presentation.
You dont get to k*ll this account.
You know how they are. Maybe itll k*ll itself.
Enough.
Im not even talking about money right now.
Im talking about the kind of workyou could do for those people.
Have you seen that motorcycle?They love design.
As long as my names in that lobby,I get to choose whom I do business with.
And Ive got a lot better reasonsthan you had with Jantzen.
Jantzen was over.
Well, I made a pledge to a lot of menyoull never meet
not to do business with them.
Christ on a cracker, where do you get off?
You know what? You werent there.You werent anywhere.
Im sorry you cant understand.
Its been almost 20 years
and whether you like it or not,the world has moved on.
These are not the same people.
How could that be? Im the same people!
You dont think I know what youre doing?
Youre wrapping yourself in the flag
so you can keep mefrom bringing in an account
because you know that every chip I make,we become less dependent on Lucky Strike
and therefore less dependent on you.
-Why, you little shit!-Roger!
Get him out of here.
The rest of us are trying to build something.
Hes right.
You know what to do.
Where would you hide a coin?Youd spend it, wouldnt you?
I do know where it is. Ill tell you.
-Then tell me.-Ill make a bargain with you.
Let these two go. Keep me. Ill tell you.
-Promise.-No.
Then no deal.
What if you wont tell me where that coin is?
I refuse to talk in this...
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Laura.
Someone else was here...
Go upstairs.
Hold Still. Ill get it.
Whats the problem? Is she sick?I wouldve come and gotten her.
No. The slumber party ended early.
Id like to speak to Betty.
Okay. Honey?
Is everything all right?
No, its not.
Could you leave us alone for a moment?
I found Sally behaving inappropriately.
Whatd she do?
She was in our den on the couchplaying with herself.
What?
I dont know what goes on here,
but that kind of behavioris not allowed in my house
and certainly notin the presence of my daughter.
I am
very sorry for this behavior and so is Sally.
I wouldve done the same thing.
Well...
Im sorry about that.
I should go.
What is wrong with you?
You dont do those things.
You dont do them in privateand you especially dont do them in public.
You have nothing to say?
I didnt do anything.
Dont you dare lie to meor Ill cut your fingers off.
Go to bed.Well deal with this in the morning.
What happened?
Im mortified.
Im so embarrassed.
What happened?
She caught Sally
playing with herself.
Whats wrong with her?That woman will tell everyone.
Why is she doing this?
I told you if it got serious,there is a solution.
I dont want to do that, Henry.
Its one thing after another.
Whats wrong with her?
Maybe its timewe let a professional answer that question.
Henry,
I went to a psychiatrist once.
What? why?
Because I was unhappyand I dont think it helps anything.
I hate to think how much worseit would have been for Eleanor without one.
They train them just for kids.We got ours from the school.
Im saying this not because Im so suretheres something wrong with her,
but I think this is very hard on you two.
-When did you go?-Years ago.
I was bored.
-Can we leave it at that?-Of course.
Miss Blankenship,any luck on that call to California?
Im sorry. No answer
Misters Peters and Pryce to see you.
Send them in.
I think were okay,but everything they do is inside out.
I got a call this morningfrom my contact there, Masao,
telling me that the meetingwas a Margaret Dumont-sized disaster,
but then... Lane?
Then, nearly 20 minutes later, Masao calledme and set a time for our presentation.
Look, theres probably a guy like Rogerat every firm.
Theyve outgrown it and we havent.
Roger has something to say.
Mn Cooper and Mn Sterling.
I realize that I should not, at this point,limit our potential clients in any way.
Next account, no matter what it is,youll have my full support.
And?
Look, I know its an old one and Ihave to let it go just for my health alone,
and, well, hell, its over.
Your contrition wouldnt have gotten youout of this, but youre lucky.
They called us todayand gave us an appointment anyway.
That means nothing.
-its over.-No, Bert, I said we have a meeting.
Its most likely that they are expecting usto come in and resign.
How do you get there from here?
Have we received a gift?
-We should have gotten one yesterday.-I havent.
Miss Blankenship,have I received any packages today?
Yes.
Could you bring it in, please?
It says "Don" on it.
Give it to him.
"Help me, Honda. Help. Help me, Honda.Love, Teddy Chaough."
-So, there is no gift.-Thats how they work.
They want us to go in there, bow downand beg them to chop our heads off
because we disgraced ourselves.How could you admire these animals?
Would you shut up? Theyre businessmenand you insulted them to their face.
Im expecting a child.
Jai Alai, Clearasil, now Honda.
Chaough wins another one by default.
Hes not going to win.
Im not wasting that appointment.
We need to do somethingthat will make them notice us. Fireworks.
-Do you have a campaign?-No.
But I will and were gonnash**t a whole commercial for it.
Something outrageous, something graphic.
The rules limit us to boards and copy.
It specifically says, "No finished work."
Because no ones ever won an accountby breaking the rules?
Not with the Japanese.
Youre trying to tell me if we put our backsinto this thing,
we couldnt turn their heads?
Three thousand dollars is all we have.
That should buyabout four seconds of your commercial.
You dont think its worthgoing out of pocket?
What pocket?
A spec commercial will eat up our abilityto pitch any more new business this year.
And its only March.
I would be willing to riskbankrupting this place
if I didnt thinkwe were already dead in the water.
But we are.
Come on, Bert.
Hello?
Am I catching you alone?
What do you want?
I prefer not to talk about this on the phone,
but its our feelingthat Sally needs to see a psychiatrist.
"Our feeling."
Why, because she cut her hair?
No, its more serious this time,
and Im telling you because I foundsomeone through the school.
A children specialist.
What exactly did she do?She set the house on fire?
She was masturbating, Don,in front of a friend.
Does that seem normal to you?
Really?
Boy or girl?
Jesus. Whats the difference?
The doctor needs to speak with us,individually of course.
So youve made up your mind.Why are you even calling me?


Shes out of control.I thought youd be concerned.
I am.I just dont know that she needs a doctor.
Cant you talk to her?
You think I want this?I dont know what else to do.
You know what kind of little girls do that?
Fast ones.
Shes 10 years old.
Well, dont think she doesnt understand.
She understands a lot of things,thanks to you.
What?
I dont care what you do,but just dont do it with her there.
You brought another maninto your bed, into her house.
You dont think she noticed that?
One man, Don. How many have you hadin your bachelor pad?
That girl you had watching her? Whos she?Im married.
Jesus. You ever hear yourself?
Ill give the information to your secretary.
-Perfect.-Good night.
Yes!
Have you seen these?Im trying to figure out what makes it work.
Im still wondering what makes you work.
Joan, Pete, Peggy.
Dont touch it.I want to see how long it goes.
Whats wrong?
"A man is shamedby being openly ridiculed and rejected.
"It requires an audience."
What is that? Fortune cookie?
Its from that bookyou were all supposed to read.
Apparently making a commercialfor the Honda pitch would bankrupt us.
And its against the rules.
Forget the rules for a second.
CGC is the same size as us.
So, if we cant afford to do anything,they cant afford to.
So everybodys bankrupt.
Chaough said hes in my rearview mirror.
Well, guess what?
Im gonna make a left turn right off a cliff.
All I have to do is let Chaough thinkIm making a commercial and hell make one.
So whats our campaign?
We dont have a campaign.Were not doing anything.
He just needs to think we are.
So what? Hes going to make a commercial.
What if its fantastic? Hell win the account.
You let me worry about that.
I know shes the best rep there is,but she told me you were unavailable.
I am. Clearasil doesnt wrap untilFriday night, but maybe you could push it.
It sounds interesting.
Well, Howard, Im going to insiston your discretion at this point.
Of course.
Its going to be four to five days.
-Just a minute.-Could you get the door?
Im sorry. I thought Id put this in here.
Later.
-Sorry about that.-Thats okay.
-You didnt see that.-No, of course not.
Thats Draper, isnt it?
Yes.
Anyway, its 12 scenes.One of them obviously has a crowd.
Youll need to figure outhow to sh**t on the Staten Island ferry,
to it and from it,and how youre going to close Fifth Avenue.
Ill be honest. Id give anything to do this,but right now Im too busy.
Anyway, you know Id much rathersh**t your Honda commercial.
I dont have one.
Why the hell did they call you in?They know Ive got you booked.
How can they afford that?
Get that kid in here who worked for Draper.
Anticipation.
Suspense.
A Honda tears through a subway tunnel,the train nipping at its tire.
He keeps looking back,the train roaring at him.
Hes wearing a racing helmet.And then you see him head up the steps.
-Can they do that?-Howardll make them do that.
And then he gets out on the sidewalk, stops,
kicks down the kickstand,takes off the helmet,
and he is a she, California blonde.
Hands down, thats your best idea.
Well bring a guy to the pitchin a racing helmet,
have him take it off, its a sexy girl.
What?
We only have $3,000,were not sh**ting shit.
How long did you work for Draper?
A little over two years.
When you were in a bake-off,he ever break the rules?
I dont know.He wouldnt have shared it with me,
but he definitely doesnt thinkthe rules apply to him.
He once disappeared for a month.
Does he like to play games?
Hes always thinkingon the edges of where you are.
I dont know. Hes a genius.
You ever talk that way about me?
You know what? Why dont you gowork for your boyfriend? Get out.
And give me 20 different wordsfor "pimples." Out!
Call Barbara about Howard hereand contact the city of New York.
We need a subway.
How are you doing?
Excuse me. Can I help you?
-Were late.-No, youre not.
Closed set. Sorry.
You scared me.
Who are you feeding today?
World travelers, Samsonite.
This is like a coconut.
Be careful.
There was a trapeze artist.
He made more in an hour herethan he makes in a week at the circus.
-Have you ever had this? Sake?-No.
I dont know how people drinkthe way you do around here.
Id fall asleep.
So whats it like being a trapeze artist?
Or did you just ask him about his luggage?
Its good.
He was surprisingly modest.
His father does it better than him.
He actually said that?
Best part of my job.
Youd be surprised what peoplewill say to an interested stranger.
Why does everybody needto talk about everything?
I dont know but they do.
And no matter what happens while theyretalking, when theyre done they feel better.
You have kids?
No.
What does your husband do?
Im not married.
But youre wearing a... Are you divorced?
No.
This is just a stop sign.
I walk into a lot of offices and its helped meavoid a lot of distracting conversations.
But you told me.
Do you have children?
I do.
Two boys and a girl,one-and-a-half, seven and 10.
Im sure it must be hard to be apart.
I dont see them enough.
And when I do, I dont know what to do.
And when I drop them off I feel relieved.
And then I miss them.
Im sorry.
It is not going well.
My ex-wife thinksmy daughter needs a psychiatrist.
And I assume youre against that.
I dont know.
Well, I cant say theresany evidence to support this,
but Im pretty sure that if you love herand she knows it, shell be fine.
Well, thank you for the drink.
I should be going.
Fake dinner plans with your fake husband?
Good night.
Now from what you told me on the phone
this year has been quite eventfulfor your family.
I know it seems fast,but I felt children had no concept of time
and Henrys really taken to them.
He has a daughter and shes suchan exceptional young woman.
If you choose to have Sally work with me,Id like to meet her,
and then interviewyou and your ex-husband.
I doubt youll ever meet him.Thats his level of interest.
Is this most recent incidentof the most concern for you?
Well, I know the divorce is mostly to blame,
but shes been differentever since my father died.
He lived with us briefly.
They were very close.
I wish he had met Henry.Thats my husband.
They wouldve gotten along.
My mother... I dont know.
My goodness, if I had done what Sally did,my mother was very strict about it.
My brother, he saved his money and boughta nudist magazine and showed it to me.
And then, my mother found itand she nailed it to his bedroom door.
What about you?
I was private and mostly outgrew it.
I see.
-Dr. Keener...-Call me Dr. Edna. Thats what the kids do.
Of course I know children do this.But not in public.
I feel like Sally did this to punish mesomehow, for everything.
That must be a terrible feeling.
It is.
You have to believe me.I had to get divorced.
I felt it best for themto have some stability in their life
and in the end,she doesnt understand that itll be better.
Sounds to me like it wouldnt be badfor you to talk to someone.
No. No, Im okay.
Well, I think itd be helpful if you and Iwere to meet once a month
just to keep up with Sallys progress.
Will you tell mewhat she talks about in here?
No.
And the other way around as well.
Thats better.
So I think we should startat four days a week.
Let me go get my date book.
-Wheres your film?-What film?
Thats how youre shaking it?I heard it stunk.
We didnt make one. its too expensive.
Well, then youre out of luck, Donny.
Cause I sure wouldntwant to follow what I showed them
with a speech and a couple of posters.
Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce.
Donald Draper.
Where is Mr. Cooper and Mr. Campbell?
And Sterling?
They couldnt make it.
You created this set of rulesto even the playing field.
It says specifically, "No finished work."
I understand not everybodyhas observed this.
I dont really want to be a partof a competition like that
so Im withdrawing us.
Thank you for thinking of us.
Good afternoon.
The voiceover announcer for Luckyhas a severe case of chest congestion.
Get the boy wonder on it.
Greg, accounts?
No, Pete.
Have a drink. itll make me look younger.
Im not gonna watch youfeel sorry for yourself.
I feel sorry for all of us.
Dons over there surrendering right now.
Would you stop?
There was a kid on the destroyer,PFC Brycen,
and he was an honest-to-goodness poet.
-And then during...-Roger, I dont want to hear it.
My husbands gonna be in uniformany day now.
But how do you think hes gonna feel
when one day some Pete Campbellgoes to some Vietnamese doctor?
Since when is forgivenessa better quality than loyalty?
Roger, I know it was awful,
and I know itll never seemlike it was that long ago,
but you fought to make the worlda safer place and you won and now it is.
You think so?
Really?
I have to.
-Anything else?-No.
Good afternoon.Your daughters psychiatrist called.
Lower your voice, please.
Congratulations.
I just spoke with Mr. Saito.
It seems Honda was nevergoing to leave Grey,
but of the three princesinvited to meet the princess,
you were the most charming.
Were first in the door on their little car.
And CGC?
Out of the running.
We k*ll him.
That stunt you pulled was unseemly.
The only reason I let you continue was...
Let me?
Do you think Joan can rent stage spacewithout talking to me?
I let you because I realizedthat our financial future
was related to Mr. Chaoughs demise.
So what is it?
Are you thanking me or reprimanding me?
-Lets not pretend like this wasnt a big risk.-Were thanking you.
Send over what you have on the car.
It redlines at 9,500 RPM,but it only has 57 horsepower.
What?
Its a motorcycle with doors.
The nice thing is it has windows,
so you can see your brains spatter against itwhen it crashes.
Theyre working on it.
Cheers.
Hello, Sally.
Im Dr. Edna.
Why dont you come inside?
