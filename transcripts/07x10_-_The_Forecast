Hello?
(KEYS JINGLING)
Don.
Don.
Draper!
(SIGHS)
Oh. (SIGHS) Melanie. Im sorry.I must have overslept.
Theyre coming before work.
I told your service,but you never called me back.
Theres no time for a shower.
Ill make the bed.
I thought you were havingthe carpets cleaned?
(SIGHS)
I did.
I find it hard to believe I have toreplace it to sell this place.
Couldnt you rent a couple of pieces?
Its so lonely.
Its better.
They can imagine their own things in it.
Have you ever sold an apartment?
Ive sold a lot uglier things than this.
Can you go?
Dont want you crossing paths.
(SIGHS)
Good luck.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
(SIGHS)
Hello?
Yes, Ill accept the charges.
Hello?
(SIGHS)
Yes, Mom, you woke me.
I dont know. Im notdue at the office yet.
Los Angeles is three hours earlier.Its simple subtraction.
I want to talk to him, too.
Well, hello, sweetie.
Do you know how much I miss you?
What did you and Grandma Gaildo this morning?
Hello?
Hello?
(SIGHS)
Room service, please.
Id like a glass of skim milk,
a grapefruit, and a pot of coffee.
And some French toast.
(SIGHS)
You wanted to see me?
Come in. Have a seat.
Can I offer you something?A pad and pen perhaps?
You know, I could have you k*ll
for drinking anythingbut a Coke around here.
To whom it may concern?
Our benevolent overlordsat McCann have invited
select presidents of select subsidiaries
to a godless retreat in the Bahamas.
So, you have to make a speech.
Thats what I thought,I figured itll be like a toast, you know?
Im good at that.
Apparently, Carolinelooked at the fine print
and theyre expectingsome sort of written statement
on the future of this company.
Twenty-five hundred words.
When?
By Monday. Plenty of time.
Harrys writing a manifestoon the computer.
Chaoughs doing performance reviews.
And they need to finish with a niceGettysburg Address-type speech
- that tells them where well be next year.- (INTERCOM BUZZES)
CAROLINE: Mr. Sterling, theres a callfor you on line three.
Gettysburg Address. Got it.
Id do it myself, butone of us is very busy.
Youre going to the Bahamas.
Im sorry. How are you doing?
Never been better.
Well, youve looked better.You want me to get my barber in here?
Anything else?
Here are the specs.
Just reasonable hopes and dreams.
Doesnt have to be science fiction.
- (INTERCOM BUZZES)- CAROLINE: Roger?
You must be Dee.
What a pleasure to meet youin the flesh. (CHUCKLES)
Top of the morning. How was your trip?
So far so good.
How about that sun?
Yes.
Have you been to California before?
Listen, Ive got to run an errand.Ill be back.
First appointment is at noon.
Did we have a cancellation?
Youre interviewing peoplewho already have jobs.
They have to sneak out.Its lunch or breakfast.
Well, I thought we could rankthe candidates in advance.
Come on, I did it, you did it.
No need to do it together.
Santa Monica or Sunset?
Sunset to Highland to Cahuenga.
Why dont you show me around?
How is the Beverly Wilshire?Have you seen Warren b*at?
Not yet.
More money, bigger accounts, more awards,
international business...
and a space station?
Gas station.
Im sorry, am I interrupting?
Do you have my thesaurus?
Probably.
Listen, you need to sign offon the Peter Pan cookie.
- Hes very busy.- Stay out of this.
We cant take it out withoutyou signing off on it and you know it.
Lets go.
You need me to set it up?
No, just broad strokes.
Peter Pans best friend is Tinker Bell.
Thats why his delicious cookieis named after her.
We have "Dear John" lettersin childrens handwriting
with kid voice-over explainingwhy theyve left the competitors
for the unique taste ofTinker Bell Cookies,
made with real Peter Pan Peanut Butter.
Each letter has a little jokeabout the competition.
(HIGH VOICE) "Dear Nilla Wafers,its so plain its over. Susie."
"Dear Oreos, dont splitapart, I love another."
"Dear Chips Ahoy, I hope..."
Okay, I get it.
And then a cartoon touch of the wandon the cookie. A sparkle.
"Peter Pan Peanut Butter lovers
"love Tinker Bell Cookiesmore than all others."
Jesus, love again?
We use it all the time.
(SIGHS) Kids wont get itand adults wont hear it.
Its not up for debate.Do you have another line?
"One Tink and youre hooked."
Whats wrong with that?
I was worried.
How will they know "Tink" is Tinker Bell?
Because youre going to tell themfive times in 60 seconds.
Are we still going to be ready?
Yeah. Thats why we had this meeting.
Jim McCloud is gonna be here any minute.Wheres Lou?
He called. Hes running late.
He called? From where?
Dont be mad at him.
Hes working on something very big.
What?
Between us...
Hanna-Barbera.
The cartoon studio?
Yes. Theyre very interestedin this comic he created.
Its like Gomer Pyle,
but hes a monkey.
How long has this been going on?
Since he was in the army.I think he misses it.
- Thats not what I meant.- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hello. How are you?You must be Mr. McCloud.
Yes. Yes, I am.
And you are?
Im Joan Harris.
Im an account executive and a partner.
Mr. Avery is stuck in traffic,but I suppose we can begin.
Im sorry.
Dee, would you offerMr. McCloud some coffee?
Please.
Hope I didnt keep you waiting.
I was catching up with Jim here.
Jim McCloud, Joan Harris.
Its a pleasure to meet you.
Pleasures mine.
Jim, come on in. Take a load off.
Dee, can you get me a Sanka?
Who are you?
Richard Burghoff.
Im looking for my optometrist.
Why didnt you say so?
A woman like you wants to talk to me,
Im a little nearsighted, Im not blind.
Have dinner with me.
I dont know.
I want to see if I can get the job.
LOU: Joan, are you coming or not?
I have to go.
French?
Why am I signing these now?
Because you sign it againwhen they cash it.
Thats how they know its you.
But anyone who steals thiscould copy my signature too.
They have it worked out, Sally.
Why are you snapping at me?This trip was your idea.
Im going to miss you.
You should really talk to themabout Colonial Williamsburg.
Youre driving right by it.
Its 12 states in 12 days.They cant stop everywhere.
Well, when I did thetrip, it was six states.
Werent they still colonies?
We got into a little bit of trouble
and I want you to knowthats to be expected.
Trouble? Really?
You know, staying up all night.
We would try and break all the light bulbs
in the hallway at every hotel.
Were not going to do that.
Well...
There are going to be boys everywhere
and youre going to be away from home.
So (INHALES DEEPLY)
I hope you have the good sense
to not act like youvebeen let out of a cage.
Im sorry, Mother,
but this conversation is a little late.
And so am l.
Everything is a joke to you.
- Howd it go?- About how I expected.
They loved the lobby,but the emptiness is a problem.
Theres other ways to sell things.
Im using everything I have,
but this requires too much imagination.
Thats the best opportunity in the world.
Whos your best prospect?
It was a young stockbroker from New Jersey
with a 4-year-old and one on the way.
Why dont you tell them somebody lived here
who made a million dollarsinventing the Frisbee.
And they had to move in a hurryto a castle in France. Taxes.
A little glamour, a little hope.
Im not a magician.
I have to show it to peoplewith their eyes open.
And you know what it looks like?
It looks like a sad person lives here.
And what happened to him?
He got divorced,spilled wine on the carpeting,
and didnt care enough toreplace it, even for himself.
Dont blame your failure on me.
This place reeks of failure.
It is an $85,000 fixer-upper.
A lot of wonderful things happened here.
Well, you wouldnt know it.
I have a good feeling about things.
See you tomorrow.
You know I have a very early flight.
- You are not going anywhere.- (LAUGHS)
Im serious.
Joan, Ive been in prison for five years.
- Youre acting like it.- (CHUCKLES)
Heres the plan.
First, Im gonna kiss you.
I know the rest of this...
Then youre gonna cancel your flight.
Then Im gonna drive youup to Malibu for lobster
in one of those tourist traps
where everyones getting engaged.
Then on up to the Biltmore in Santa Barbara
where Ill sit on a lounge chair,
and watch you get in and out of the pool.
Richard, that sounds wonderful.
But I have someplace to be.
And Im sure you do as well.
- I told you, Im retired.- Yes.
And you were a millionaire developer.
You must think I just fell off a truck.
(CHUCKLES)
Are you a movie producer as well?
- No.- (LAUGHS)
But the rest of it is the truth, honey.
What is the rest of it?
I guess weve beendancing around this all night.
Im divorced.
You?
You think I would be doing thisif I was married?
Have you ever been married?
Yes.
Boy, did he blow it.
He did.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Twenty-two years.
I stayed in it for the kids.
And when my youngest graduated,
I saw her heading off toEurope and I thought,
"Jeez,
"that looks good."
I mean, hell, I built something.I built a lot of things.
But I also put off a lot of things.
And now Im free. As a bird.
I need to work.
So you have mouths to feed?
No.
I just finally got thejob Ive always wanted.
So youre just an executiveon a trip out of town.
Ill send you flowers.
(LAUGHS)
Good morning, Meredith.
Mr. Sterling came byfor your prognostication.
I told him you were at the library.
Not a bad idea.
And can you dig up the press releasefrom when we started SCDP?
That would be December 63.
Coffee?
Good morning, Don.
No. Ill get it.
(DOOR KNOCKS AND OPENS)
Meredith got me two of these.I only need one.
Sure.
When are you casting St. Josephs?
Two weeks. Did you meet someonewe should see?
No, just organizing my schedule.
(SIGHS)
You ever feel like theres less toactually do, but more to think about?
Not really.
Maybe Im a bad manager.
Maybe Im too...
What do they call it? Hands-on.
So, going to this castingsession. Whats next?
sh**t the ad?
No.
Whats the future going to bring?
I mean, its good as it is, but is therea scenario in which its better?
Youre incredible.
You know, Roger asked me to do that first.
(CHUCKLES)
Howd you get out of it?
I thought about it alittle and then I realized
youre so much betterat painting a picture.
So, you did have thoughts.
Sure.
Well have an oil company.You know, maybe Goodyear Tires.
We know so much about cars.
Thats your dream?
No, I mean,
obviously Id like to one day...
I dont know.
What?
Id really love to
land a pharmaceutical.
Bigger accounts?
Thats your greatest desire?
Thats why Im doingthe performance reviews.
(SIGHS DEEPLY)
You know, before McCann,all I ever thought of
was will we be in business next year?
Or will I be here at all?
Now, it could be anything.
(SIGHS)
(INTERCOM BUZZES)
WOMAN: I have a Richard Burghoffon the line.
Ill take it.
Hello.
Well, your story checks out.
(LAUGHS)
Its nice to hear from you.
How are things in paradise?
I dont know. Im in town.
What? Youre in New York?
Tell me where were eating.
The Oak Room, 7:30.
Should I pick you up at work or at home?
Ill see you there.
Well, good. You can make an entrance.
- There you are.- There you are.
We have a peanut butter cookie problem.
PEGGY: Don, dont listen to him.
Pete, what are you doing?
The client hated the layout.
Exactly, thats the problem.
And then Mathis and Edturned on each other.
There was some kind of"I told you so" exchange,
which was already unbearably inappropriate.
And then Mathis said...
A four-letter word that starts with
Have you ever heard such a thing?
He was frustrated. He cant fire my men.
I can fire you!
Hold on.
Nobodys getting fired.You have to send those idiots back in.
Absolutely not!
If you send someone new, it lookslike were starting over.
It was a crime of passion.Theyve heard the word before.
Fine.
I want new work fast.
Problem solved.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
May I help you?
Is Sally home? Im a friend of hers.
Sally.
Theres a young man here to see you.
Whats your name, maam?
Its Loretta.
Is Mrs. Draper home?
You mean Mrs. Francis.
What are you doing here?
I was in the neighborhood.
You know, Bettys home.
I dont care. I just wanted to see you.
See? You survived finals.
Hows your summer?
Im going on a teen tour.
Then, maybe be a lifeguard again.
Do you have something to do right now?
(DOORBELL RINGS)
- I got it.- I got it.
Hey, Ill be out in a second.
I have to use the restroom.
This is Paula. This is Sally.
Hey there. Could you get mea map to the powder room?
Uh, first door on the left.
BETTY: Hello.
You have a lovely home.
Sally, I didnt know you had guests.
We just dropped by.
We were on our way to Playland
and thought maybe youd want to come.
Arent you going to introduce me?
Im Glen Bishop. We livedup the street in Ossining.
Glen?
My goodness. How old are you?
Eighteen.
So, you two have stayed in touch?
- Yeah.- Weve been pen pals.
What have you been doing with yourself?
(LAUGHS) You look so different.
You look exactly the same.
Good, you found my backpack.
Yes, it was in the storage room.
Oh, you must be in school.
Yeah, just finished my freshmanyear up at Purchase.
Thats supposed to be very good.
Im actually going back to school myselfthis fall.
Very cool.
Can I have some actual moneyto take to Playland?
What? Of course. Go get my pocketbook.
Cant you?
Hey. Sorry for running past you.
My mother hates that.Just really had to go.
Thats quite all right.
Can I offer you all something to drink?
- Iced tea?- No.
- Id take a beer if you got one.- Of course.
Hold on. I thought we were goingto Playland. Are you coming?
Id love to go with you,but I dont have any money.
(CHUCKLES)
You talk to your parents this way?
Do you have any grass?
We can get it there.
Dont stay too late. You have to pack.
Nice meeting you.
Enjoy the rest of your summer.
Betty.
Yes?
I feel like I should saya more formal goodbye.
Nonsense. Youre welcome here anytime.
No. Its just that
Im shipping out next week.
What do you mean?
Im reporting.
He joined the army.
Are you kidding?
No.
- Are you f*cking stupid?- Sally!
I dont expect you to understand.
- You hate the w*r.- Not anymore.
What about Kent State? You were crying.
You were gonna join the movement.
What about a bunch of n*gro kids dying
while we just sit at home getting stoned?
- Its immoral.- Was this your idea?
We just met.
Youre gonna die. For what?
Dont listen to Jane Fonda here.
Its a very brave thing to do.
SALLY: You know what?
Have fun at Playland.
Just remember those kids are the same age
as the ones youre going to bem*rder in Vietnam.
Sally, come on.
Im sorry.
No.
- I expected it.- (DOOR SLAMS)
Well, youve obviously growninto a fine young man.
Thank you, maam.
Please dont let this mar your afternoon.
Well see you when you get back.
Sally, too.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Fourscore and seven years ago.
We know where weve been,we know where we are.
Lets assume that its good.
(SIGHS)
But its got to get better.
Its supposed to get better.
(INTERCOM BUZZES)
MEREDITH: Mr. Mathis needs to see you.I told him you were busy.
Send him in. (CLEARS THROAT)
Hello, Don.
Just wanted to thank youfor fighting for me.
Who told you that?
Should we open it?
Im set.
I appreciate your confidence in me.
What do you want?
I want you to come to the meeting.
No.
You have to make this right yourself.
How? I mean, do I apologize to them?
Do I apologize to Ed?
Do I slam my hand in thedoor over and over?
I once interrupted the client
during a presentation forLucky Strike, our biggest account.
- What did you say?- I wasnt supposed to talk at all.
(CHUCKLES)
I knew if I apologized, theyd neverwanna work with me again.
Why?
Do I really have to explain that?
Not if you dont want to.
So the next meeting, I walked in,shook Lee Garners hand and said,
"I cant believe you have the balls
"to come back after youembarrassed yourself like that."
(LAUGHS)
Okay. I think I understand.
I dont know.
Bring in a bar of soap.
Tell them its there in caseyou need to wash your mouth.
Something like that.
Thank you, Don.
(DOOR CLOSES)
This was a big deal. Four golf courses.
Some with estates planned on the perimeter.
- Palos Verdes.- Is that nice?
Yes, dear.
And all of a sudden,
some hippies come out of the wall yelling
about low-income housing, k*ll birds.
Must be real radicals
to prefer low-income housingto a golf course.
Come on, whose side are you on?
I just root for the underdog.
Well, lets see how softhearted you are.
How about a nightcap?
That sounds nice.
Where did you tell him you were?
Who?
Tell me the truth. Are you married?
No.
Please dont lie to me.
I have a little boy.
Oh.
His name is Kevin and hes four.
Four? Thats a very little boy.
Does that make a difference?
No.
Can I get the check?
Yes, Im fine. Um...
When do you expect him back?
But Im going out of town tomorrow
and I want to say goodbye.
Yes.
Just tell him Im sorry
and I want to say goodbye.
He has to call me.
Im sorry. I didnt want to make you cry.
(SNIFFLES)


Okay.
(LAUGHING) What are you doing?
I want your hands free.
Do you mind if I make a phone call?
I should tell somebodyIm going to be late.
- Can I offer you a brandy?- Gin and tonic.
May I have an outside line, please?
Look at this. Ice.
Thats a good hotel.
Well, Im not gonna ask now,as a matter of fact...
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Harris residence.
Hello, Maureen. Its Joan.
I wanted to see if you couldstay a few hours longer.
I dont know.
Its already a quarter to 10:00.
Well, what did we say, 11:00?How about 1:00?
I dont know. I kind ofhave someplace to be.
Any chance in persuading youto stay until midnight?
Okay. You know,he had trouble going to sleep.
He said he was afraidof a cow or something.
Its a horse. ls everything okay now?
I dont know. I havent heard anything.
Ill check on him.
Wonderful. Thanks so much.
You need to go?
No. We have all the time we need.
Or until midnight.
I wasnt going to spend the night
under any circumstances.
Its the kind of woman I am.
A woman with a little kid.
Would you rather I was married?
Honey, give me a little bit of creditfor the fact that, well,
I could have been a cad
and waited until after to tell you...
I dont like this.
YOU dont like what?
I love kids.
But I raised mine already and Im...
I know it sounds selfish.
I mean, Im done with that part of my life.
Youre being presumptuous.
I know what this is and so do you.
Or you wouldnt have lied.
I cant believe this.
Youre such a disappointment.
This is not how I saw things.
I have a plan, which is no plans.
You cant go to the pyramids.You cant go anywhere.
Youre right.
Nice meeting you.
(SIGHS)
(INTERCOM BUZZES)
MEREDITH: Miss Olson would like to see youwhen you have a moment.
Send her in.
Ted told me I have to fill outmy own performance review.
I guess he respects your opinion.
Im tired of this.
Id start with that.
Im serious.
I want to have my performance reviewed.
Ive had quite a year.
(SIGHS)
What do you see for the future?
Well, um, is that on there?
No, Im just curious.
Id like to be the firstwoman creative director at this agency.
Thats funny to you?
No, Im impressed that you know exactly.
What else is there?
Thats what Im asking.
Lets say you get that.
Whats next?
Land something huge.
And then?
Have a big idea.
Create a catchphrase.
So you want fame?
Yes.
What else?
I dont know.
Yes, you do.
Create something
of lasting value.
(CHUCKLES)
In advertising?
This is supposed to be about my job,not the meaning of life.
So you think those things are unrelated?
I didnt know youd be in a mood.
Do you want me to do this or not?
Why dont you just write downall of your dreams
so I can shit on them?
(DOOR CLOSES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Where the hell were you?
Good morning to you, too. I was at class.
Why didnt mention that last night?
Didnt Gail give you my schedule?
You and Gail are quite a team.
She really needed a vacation.
I think you need a vacation.
You know what?
Youre ruining my life.
KEVIN: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, sweetie.
(DOOR OPENS)
Anyway, I think youll be impressed.
If nothing else, by the speed with whichthey turned this around.
Well, nice to see you again.
I cant believe you twohave the balls to walk back into this place
after the way you embarrassed yourselves.
(SNICKERING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Did you go to the Worlds Fair?
Thats what I think itsgoing to look like.
What was your favorite part?
Oh, good. Youre here.
- Can I help you?- Get out.
Whats going on?
I tried your little sayingand Im off the business.
What are you talking about?
I made yourjoke and it failed miserably.
- The soap thing?- No!
The one where I toldthem they were assholes.
You couldve thought ofsomething yourself, you know.
I did. It was apologize,
but you dont understand that
because guys like you dont have to do it.
Guys like me know how to do it.
Roger tells that Lucky Strike story, too.
But he says that Lee Garner Jr.Was in love with you.
That you always had to be at the meetings
so he could think about jacking you off.
You have a foul mouth.
Take responsibility for your failure.
That account was handed to youand you made nothing of it
because you have no character.
You dont have any character.
Youre just handsome.Stop kidding yourself.
Everybody has problems.
Some people can deal with themand some people cant.
Look at yourself.
Because the next thing youre going to haveto move past is losing this job.
Youre fired.
I guess I kind of assumed thatwhen lwalked in here.
I just knew I shouldnt apologize.
- Is everything all right?- Can you shut the door for me?
(INTERCOM BUZZES)
WOMAN: Theres a Jim McCloudhere to see you.
Hes waiting in the lounge.
What are you doing here?
Well, thank you so much.
Im a heel, okay?
No, its my fault.
I thought about itand Im sending my son away.
What?
No, I thought about whatyou said. And I like you too.
And if I have to choose betweenyou and my son, I choose you.
Thats not what I said.
Thats exactly what you said.
Well, Ive thought about it and I wantto be a part of your life.
And your little boy, too.
I live with my mother.
And Ive been divorced twice.
Im buying some property in New York.
Where do you live?

Okay, Im not gonnabuy property down there. (CHUCKLES)
But Im gonna get a placein a nice neighborhood

Okay.

GLEN: Hello.
Oh, hello.
Loretta let me in on her way out.I didnt want to surprise you.
No, thats fine.
You know, Sallys not here.
I know.
Can I get something to drink?
Of course.
What do you have in mind?
How about that beer?
- Do you want to sit down?- No.
They have beer over there.
From what I read in the magazines,they have all the comforts of home.
Sallys mad. My mothers mad.
But youre not.
Look, theyre afraid for you.
I am too, honestly.
But you understand why Im doing it.
Do you want me to say that I like it?
I know you do because Im braveand I love this country
and I want to protectit and everyone in it.
Glen.
I know something could happen to me.
But I feel safe because I know youre mine.
Glen, stop.
Why?
Because Im married.
Im sorry.
Its okay.
I understand.
You dont.
Well, I dont know whatIm supposed to say.
This was gonna be the good thingthat came out of all this.
This is all I thought about.
Glen.
I know you know me.
I know you know the man I can be.
Glen,
please dont tell me thatyou did this for me.
I couldnt live with myself.
Its so much worse.
What?
I flunked out.
(SIGHS) Oh, no.
My stepdad knew I was doing bad.
Hes gonna k*ll me. Kick me out.
After I told him,
he was so proud.
Everything was peaches and cream.
Youre going to make it.
Im positive.
Dont let me fill up on these.
The bus leaves at 8:30.Will the food come in time?
They must have run out of stray cats.
(GIRLS LAUGH)
Youre so funny.
- He always says that.- Its still funny.
What place are you most excited about?
Washington D.C. Were goingto the floor of the Senate.
To protest?
No, were getting a tour from Senator Dodd.
Were going to find an office for Carol.
You wanna work there one day?
I want to be a senator.
Thats impressive. Good for you.
I dont know what I want to be.
Youll figure it out.What are your interests?
I guess I just want to live in New York.
I want to be a translator at the UN.
Yolandas father is a diplomat.
Im so tired of peopleasking me what I want to do.
Well, if youre lucky enough to thinkof it, you should write it down.
Because when you get older,youre gonna forget.
Did you write down "advertising"?
I didnt know what advertising was.
But I wanted to be in New York City, too.
(CHUCKLES)
So, where do you live, Don?
Where do I live? The Upper East Side.
In a penthouse?
As a matter of fact, yes.
But he grew up very poor.
And now you have a penthouse.
May n
Sure.
When I watch television,
the commercials are my favorite part.
(CHUCKLES)
So what do you want to do?
I just want to eat dinner.
Nothing like having realistic goals.
(GIRLS LAUGH)
Goodbye, Mr. Draper.
Bye.
Thanks for dinner.
Sally.
Ill wave from the bus.
Hold on a second.
Its okay to be nervous about going away.
You cant control yourself, can you?
What are you talking about?
Sarahs 17, you know.
(CHUCKLES)
Im well aware of that, Sally.
But it doesnt stop you.
And it doesnt stop Mom.
Anyone pays attention to either of you,
and they always do...
And you just ooze everywhere.
Your friends a fast girl, Sally.I didnt want to embarrass her.
You know what Im gonnawrite down for my dream?
I want to get on a busand get away from you and Mom
and hopefully bea different person than you two.
Hey-
Im your father.
And you may not want to listen to this,
but you are like your mother and me.
Youre gonna find that out.
Youre a very beautiful girl.
Its up to you to be more than that.
(ENGINE STARTS)
(TOY g*n FIRING)
